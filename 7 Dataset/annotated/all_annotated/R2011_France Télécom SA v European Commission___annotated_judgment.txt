gives the following
Judgment
1
By its appeal, France Télécom SA (‘FT’) seeks to have set aside the judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of the European Communities (now ‘the General Court’) in 
Joined Cases T-427/04 and T-17/05 France and France Télécom v Commission [2009] 
ECR II-4315 (‘the judgment under appeal’), by which that court dismissed the action 
for annulment of Commission Decision 2005/709/EC of 2 August 2004 concerning 
State aid paid by France to FT (OJ 2005 L 269, p. 30) (‘the contested decision’). || NA

In the judgment under appeal, the General Court set out the legal background and 
the facts of the dispute before it as follows:

JUDGMENT OF 8. || NA
12. || NA
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
16	 Business tax is a local tax, the rules of which are laid down by statute and codified 
in the General Tax Code. || NA
17	 … business tax is payable each year by natural or legal persons regularly pursuing 
a self-employed occupation as at 1 January. || NA
18	 … the imposition of business tax depends on the taxable person’s ability to pay, 
which is assessed in accordance with economic criteria on the basis of the extent 
of the business activities engaged in by the taxable person in the territory of the 
recipient body. || NA
19	 It follows that the business tax is not based on the profit made by the undertak
ing’s business, but, at the material time, on a proportion of the value of the pro
duction factors – capital and labour – used by the taxable person in each munici
pality in which the tax is established. || NA
20	 … for taxation relating to the years 1994 to 2002, in the case of legal persons liable 
to corporation tax, the basis for the business tax included (i) the rental value of 
the fixed assets which the taxable person had used to meet its business require
ments during the reference period and (ii) a proportion of the salaries paid during 
the reference period. || NA
21	 … the reference period … is to be the penultimate year preceding the year of tax­
ation, where the financial year coincides with the calendar year, or, where that is 
not the case, the financial year ending during the penultimate year preceding the 
year of taxation. || NA

FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
22	 … the business tax is to be established in each municipality in which the taxable 
person has premises or land, on the basis of the rental value of the assets situated 
in that municipality or connected with it, and the salaries paid to staff. || NA
…
Rules applicable to FT
Principle of liability to tax under the ordinary law
25	 Law No  90-568 [of 2  July 1990 on the organisation of the public postal and 
telecommunications services (JORF of 8 July 1990, p. 8069) (“Law No 90-568”)], 
by which FT … [was] founded, lays down special tax provisions. || NA
26	 … subject to [certain] exceptions … FT is [in principle] to be subject to duties and 
taxes … payable by private undertakings carrying out the same transactions. || NA
Fixed levy
27	 … FT was, until 1 January 1994, to be subject only to such duties and taxes as were 
actually borne by the State. || NA
Consequently, FT was not liable inter alia for corpor­
ation tax or local taxes, such as business tax. || NA
In exchange, FT had to pay, for the 
years 1991 to 1993, a contribution fixed each year by the Finance Law, subject to a 
maximum amount, the base for which, before the application of discount factors, 
was equal to the balance shown by the additional budget for telecommunications 
for the year 1989 …

Special tax regime
…
30	 The tax [payable by way of business tax] – the basis of assessment for which, 
for the purposes of calculating specific tax bases, followed the general rules laid 
down in the General Tax Code … – was established through the application of a 
national weighted average rate, based on the rates voted the previous year by all 
the local authorities …
31	 Furthermore, a rate of 1.9 % – instead of 8 % – was applied to FT in respect of 
management costs, that is to say, an additional sum levied by the State to offset 
the expenses incurred by the tax authorities in assessing tax and collecting busi
ness tax for the local authorities. || NA
32	 The tax revenue had to be paid to the State or, for the proportion exceeding the 
contribution paid for the year 1994, adjusted each year to reflect the fluctuation in 
the consumer price index, to the Fonds national de péréquation de la taxe profes
sionnelle (National Business Tax Equalisation Fund) …

3. Administrative procedure
35	 On 13 March 2001, the Association des collectivités territoriales pour le retour 
de la taxe professionnelle de France Télécom et de La Poste dans le droit commun 


I  -  12947
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
(Association of local authorities for the reinstatement under the general law of 
the business tax regime applicable to FT and La Poste) submitted a complaint 
to the Commission to the effect that the special tax regime constituted State aid 
which was incompatible with the common market. || NA
The complainant referred 
inter alia to the loss of revenue for certain municipalities as a result of the applica
tion of a national weighted average rate. || NA
36	 Following that complaint, the Commission decided on 28 June 2001 to initiate the 
preliminary investigation procedure in respect of the special tax regime and sent 
the French Republic a request for information. || NA
37	 By letter of 26 September 2001, the French Republic replied that the special tax 
regime did not constitute State aid, because it did not confer any advantage on FT 
and entailed no loss of State resources. || NA
38	 On 30 January 2003, the Commission adopted a decision initiating the formal in
vestigation procedure provided for under Article 88(2) EC in respect inter alia of 
the exemption from business tax granted to FT from 1991 to 1993 and of the spe
cial tax regime (“the decision initiating the formal investigation”). || NA
The decision 
initiating the formal investigation was notified to the French Republic by letter of 
31 January 2003. || NA
At the request of the French authorities, the Commission noti
fied a rectified version of that decision on 7 March 2003. || NA
In the decision initiating 
the formal investigation, the Commission estimated the advantage conferred on 
FT as being worth approximately FRF 1 000 million per annum since 1994 (para
graphs 73 and 74). || NA
The initiation decision was published on 12 March 2003 (OJ 
2003 C 57, p. 5). || NA

4. The contested decision
53	 On 19 and 20 July 2004, at its 1 667th meeting, the College of Commissioners ap
proved a draft decision finding that FT had received State aid during the period 
from 1994 to 2002 by virtue of the special tax regime (“the aid at issue”) and em
powered the Member responsible for competition to adopt, with the agreement 
of the President, the definitive version of the decision in French – the authentic 
language – after “legal linguistic revision”. || NA
54	 On 2 August 2004, the Commission adopted [the contested decision]. || NA
It was noti
fied to the French Republic on 3 August 2004.
…
61	 In the contested decision, the Commission found, first, that the fixed levy, provid
ed … for the period from 1991 to 1993, could be regarded as replacing the busi
ness tax normally payable for those years. || NA
Accordingly, the exemption from busi
ness tax during that period did not constitute State aid (recitals 22 to 33 and 53 
[of the contested decision]). || NA
62	 On the other hand, the Commission found that the special tax regime applicable 
from 1994 to 2002 introduced State aid consisting in the difference between the 
tax which FT should have paid under the general law and the amount of business 
tax actually paid (“the tax differential”). || NA
Moreover, that new aid, implemented un
lawfully in breach of Article 88(3) EC, was incompatible with the common mar
ket. || NA
It therefore had to be recovered (recitals 34 to 53 of the contested decision). || NA
I  -  12949
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
63	 The Commission gave the following reasons for categorising the special tax 
regime as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC. || NA
64	 First, the Commission set out the reasons why it considered it appropriate to 
discount the argument of the French authorities to the effect that the advantage 
found during the period from 1994 to 2002 was more than offset by the fixed levy 
which FT had had to pay during the period from 1991 to 1993 (recitals 35 to 41 of 
the contested decision). || NA
65	 First of all, the Commission states that Law No 90-568 had established two suc
cessive and distinct tax regimes: (i) an exemption regime, applicable from 1991 
to 1993, under which a fixed levy replaced the general law taxes, including busi
ness tax, and (ii) a special regime introduced by way of derogation, as a result 
of which business tax was underpaid and which initially applied from 1994 and 
which was terminated with effect from the 2003 tax assessments (recitals 36 
and 38 of the contested decision). || NA
…
67	 Consequently, the Commission found that it could not agree that the tax differen
tial from which FT had benefited between 1994 and 2002 had been offset by the 
fixed levy paid between 1991 and 1993, which was not connected with business 
tax either specifically by Law No 90-568 or by the method by which it was calcu
lated (recital 38 of the contested decision). || NA
68	 Moreover, the Commission found that payment of the fixed levy at issue was more 
akin to paying a share of the earnings to the owner of the capital than to taxation. || NA
In those circumstances, it was only by way of exception that the Commission had 
been able to accept that the levy offset the total exemption from business tax from 
which FT had benefited from 1991 to 1993. || NA
A normal application of the law could, 
on the contrary, have led to the conclusion that that exemption constituted State 


I  -  12950
JUDGMENT OF 8. || NA
12. || NA
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
aid, the amount of which should have been added to that of the tax differential 
enjoyed by FT since 1994 under the special tax regime (recitals 38 and 39 of the 
contested decision). || NA
69	 Lastly, the Commission found that the argument that the payments made by FT 
to the State between 1991 and 1993 should be set off against the under-taxation 
of FT from 1994 would involve categorising the surplus tax paid by FT (as com
pared with the tax payable under the general law) between 1991 and 1993 as a tax 
credit, which was not the aim of Law No 90-568. || NA
Nor, according to the Commis
sion, does that a posteriori theoretical justification reflect the normal application 
of French tax law: rather, it is designed solely to prevent recovery of the State aid 
granted to FT (recital 40 of the contested decision). || NA
70	 Secondly, the Commission found that the tax differential represented an advan
tage for FT, granted from resources which should have been incorporated into 
the budget of the State and accordingly constituted State aid (recital 42 of the 
contested decision). || NA
71	 Thirdly, in recitals 43 and 44 of the contested decision, the Commission stated 
that, in order to determine the net advantage from which FT had benefited, it 
could not take into consideration, at the stage of the decision establishing the 
existence of State aid, the French Republic’s argument that the corporation tax 
factor should be corrected downwards because of the higher amounts paid by 
way of business tax …


I  -  12951
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
72	 Fourthly, the Commission – rejecting the arguments submitted by the French 
Republic to the effect that the aid at issue could not be recovered because of the 
limitation rules laid down in Article 15 of [Council] Regulation [EC] No 659/1999 
[of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 
EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1)] – found that the aid at issue was new aid, not existing aid 
(recital 45 [of the contested decision]). || NA
73	 First, the Commission stated that the expiry of the limitation period laid down in 
Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 did not have the effect of converting new 
aid into existing aid, but only of preventing the Commission from ordering the 
recovery of aid granted more than 10 years before the date on which time began 
to run for the purposes of barring recovery (recitals 46 to 48 of the contested 
decision). || NA
74	 Second, the Commission argued that Law No  90-568 had established an aid 
scheme and that any limitation concerns only the aid granted under that scheme 
and not the scheme itself. || NA
The point from which time starts to run is therefore 
the day on which each form of aid was actually granted to FT, that is to say, on 
the date, each year, on which the business tax was due (recital 49 of the contested 
decision). || NA
75	 Third, the Commission added that the limitation period had been interrupted by 
the request for information sent to the French Republic on 28 June 2001 (recital 
50 of the contested decision). || NA
76	 The Commission therefore concluded that, since the first form of aid identified 
had been granted in 1994 – that is to say, fewer than 10 years before 28 June 2001 – 
the aid at issue had to be recovered in its entirety (recital 51 of the contested 
decision). || NA
I  -  12952
JUDGMENT OF 8. || NA
12. || NA
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
77	 Fifth, the Commission stated that the French authorities had not put forward any 
focused argument to prove that the aid at issue was compatible with the com
mon market and that the Commission could see no legal basis on which it could 
be declared compatible with the common market (recital 52 [of the contested 
decision]). || NA
78	 Consequently, in recital 53 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded 
that (i) the business tax regime applicable to FT during the period from 1991 
to 1993 did not constitute State aid and (ii) the tax differential from which FT had 
benefited during the period from 1994 to 2002, as a consequence of the special 
tax regime, constituted State aid which was incompatible with the common mar
ket and which had been unlawfully implemented, and which must therefore be 
recovered. || NA
79	 However, the exact amount to be recovered could not be determined, owing to 
the discrepancies in the information submitted by the French authorities dur
ing the administrative procedure. || NA
The Commission estimated that the aid to be 
recovered was in the amount – net of interest – of between EUR 798 million and 
EUR 1 140 million (recitals 54 to 59 [of the contested decision]). || NA
80	 In recital 54 of the contested decision, the Commission referred to a report 
presented to the French Parliament by the Directorate-General for Taxes in No
vember 2001, according to which “the immediate normalisation of the conditions 
of taxation of FT in relation to business tax would involve, at an unchanged rate, 
an over-taxation of almost 198 million euros for the company”. || NA
81	 In addition, the Commission relied on the estimate of 15 May 2003, the results of 
which are set out in tabular form in recital 54 of the contested decision. || NA
According 


I  -  12953
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
to the figures produced by the French Republic, the aggregate theoretical taxation 
of FT under the general law, for the years 1994 to 2002, was EUR 8 362 million. || NA
The aggregate actual taxation charged to FT for the same years, under the special 
tax regime, is EUR 7 222 million. || NA
The tax differential enjoyed by FT during the 
period from 1994 to 2002 is therefore EUR 1 140 million. || NA
82	 The Commission also pointed out that, by letter of 29 January 2004, the French 
authorities had informed it of the amount of the tax charged to FT, under the 
general law, for the year 2003 (EUR 773 million) and confirmed that the estimate 
of 15 May 2003 was sound (recital 55 of the contested decision). || NA
It was not until 
the meetings held on 16 and 23 June 2003 that the French authorities contested 
the reliability of those figures (recitals 56 and 57 of the contested decision). || NA
83	 On 5 July 2004, of the French authorities submitted a new estimate. || NA
This gave dif
ferent results, reproduced in tabular form in recital 58 of the contested decision. || NA
The aggregate theoretical taxation of FT under the general law, for the years 1994 
to 2002, had been reduced to EUR 8 020 million. || NA
The tax differential enjoyed by 
FT during the period from 1994 to 2002 is therefore EUR 798 million. || NA
84	 Owing to the contradictory information provided by the French Republic dur
ing the administrative procedure, the Commission found that it was unable to 
determine the amount to be recovered, which was between EUR 798 million and 
EUR 1 140 million, plus interest. || NA
According to the Commission, the exact amount 
to be recovered had to be determined by the French authorities, in accordance 


I  -  12954
JUDGMENT OF 8. || NA
12. || NA
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
with their duty to cooperate in good faith, when the contested decision was im
plemented (recitals 59 and 60 of the contested decision). || NA
85	 In consequence of all the foregoing, the enacting terms of the contested decision 
state:
“Article 1
The State aid granted illegally by [the French Republic] in infringement of Article 88(3)

In their actions before the General Court for annulment of the contested decision

The appeal
8
FT relies on five grounds of appeal, alleging that the General Court: (i) erred in law 
by classifying the special tax regime as State aid, when the existence of an advantage 
for FT depended on factors unrelated to that regime; (ii) misconstrued the concept of 
State aid in that the Commission failed to take account of the overall tax regime ap
plicable to FT during the years from 1991 to 2002; (iii) failed to have proper regard for 
the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations; (iv) failed to state reasons 
in the judgment under appeal with regard to the principle of limitation and; (v) erred 
in law and failed to state adequate reasons for the judgment under appeal with regard 
to the principle of legal certainty. || NA
The first ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law by classifying 
the special tax regime as State aid, when the existence of an advantage for FT depended 
on factors unrelated to that regime
Arguments of the parties
9
FT submits that the existence of any financial advantage that may have been con
ferred on it as compared with the position under the general law depends on a range 
of variables, such as the different rates of business tax applicable in the French mu
nicipalities in which taxable assets are held and the geographical location of those 
assets. || NA
Consequently, the special tax regime applicable to FT from 1994 was not ad
vantageous in itself and, as a result, the General Court should have rejected the clas
sification of the tax regime at issue as State aid. || NA
I  -  12959
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
10
FT takes the view that the General Court misconstrued the concept of State aid by 
finding, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, that the existence of any 
advantage did not depend on the specific features of the tax regime at issue, but on 
factors unrelated to that regime, the effects of which may be determined only ex 
post. || NA
The advantages or disadvantages deriving from those factors could not lead to a 
measure being characterised as aid when, at the time of its adoption, it could not be 
so characterised. || NA
11
The French Republic submits that a special tax regime is not in itself capable of con
stituting State aid. || NA
Such a regime would not necessarily confer a selective advantage 
on the undertakings concerned. || NA
12
The Commission considers that the ground of appeal in question is inadmissible, 
since it was not raised at first instance. || NA
13
The Commission also maintains that the ground is unfounded. || NA
It was not possible to 
determine in advance, for each year, the precise level of taxation under the special 
regime. || NA
However, that regime could have led to less tax being payable by comparison 
with the position under the general law on business tax. || NA
14
The Commission adds that it is not unusual for the examination of State aid to require 
account to be taken of events that took place after the occurrence of the measure in 
question, in order to determine whether such aid in fact existed and to quantify it in 
order to recover the advantage obtained. || NA

2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
Findings of the Court
15
With regard to the Commission’s claim that the first ground of appeal is inadmissible, 
it should be noted that that ground, which forms part of the submissions relating to 
the existence of State aid, was put forward at first instance in the context of the first 
and second pleas relied on before the General Court. || P_A1
16
As regards whether that ground is well founded, according to settled case-law, the 
definition of aid is more general than that of a subsidy. || P_A2
It includes not only positive 
benefits but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are 
normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being 
subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same 
effect (see, Joined Cases C-78/08 to C-80/08 Paint Graphos and Others [2011] ECR 
I-7611, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited). || P_A3
17
It should also be noted that the concept of advantage that is intrinsic to the clas
sification of a measure as State aid is an objective one, irrespective of the motives of 
the persons responsible for the measure in question. || P_A4
Accordingly, the nature of the 
objectives pursued by State measures and their grounds of justification have no bear
ing whatsoever on whether such measures are to be classified as State aid. || P_A5
It is estab
lished case-law that Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between the causes or the 
objectives of State aid, but defines them in relation to their effects (see Case C-409/00 
Spain v Commission [2003] ECR I-1487, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited). || P_A6
18
As regards the present case, it should be noted that the tax regime to which FT was 
subject during the second period under consideration, namely during the years from 
1994 to 2002, constituted an exception to the general law regime. || P_A7
In particular, that 
company benefited from specific tax treatment at national level, characterised by the 
fact that business tax was calculated on the basis of a weighted average rate, as op
posed to the various rates applicable in the different local authorities, whereas the 
rates to which other undertakings were subject were those voted annually by those 


I  -  12961
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
authorities. || P_A8
Moreover, FT was subject to a single rate of business tax in its principle 
place of business, whereas other undertakings were taxed at the different rates voted 
by the local authorities in the territory within which those undertakings had estab
lishments. || P_A9
A rate of 1.9 % was also applied to FT, as opposed to the rate of 8 % ap­
plicable to other undertakings, in respect of management costs. || P_A10

As regards the argument relied on in the present appeal that the General Court’s 
examination of the tax regime at issue should have taken account of a number of vari
ables and extraneous factors, it should be noted that, even though, given the particu
lar characteristics of that regime, the Commission was not in a position to determine 
in advance for each tax year the precise level of taxation for that year, it is nevertheless 
accepted that the regime was capable of resulting and in fact resulted – as is apparent 
from recital 59 of the contested decision and paragraph 225 of the judgment under 
appeal – in FT’s liability to business tax being lower than it would have been if the 
general law business tax regime had been applied. || P_A11
20
It should also be noted that, irrespective of the rates of business tax adopted by the 
local authorities, FT benefited in all circumstances from a reduced rate in respect of 
management costs. || P_A12
21
In those circumstances, the General Court was correct to hold, at paragraph 323 of 
the judgment under appeal, that the finding of the existence of aid depended on a 
number of ‘circumstances unrelated to’ the special tax regime, such as the fact that 
the business tax was charged annually and the level of the tax rates voted each year by 
the authorities in the territory in which FT had establishments. || P_A13

22
Contrary to the French Republic’s and FT’s claims, such circumstances do not in any 
way preclude the possibility that, even at the time of its adoption, the special tax 
regime could have been classified as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC. || P_A14
Indeed, it is necessary to make a distinction between, on the one hand, the adoption 
of an aid scheme, namely in the present case the special tax regime, and, on the other, 
the grant of annual aid to FT on the basis of that regime, the precise total amount of 
which depended on certain external factors. || P_A15
23
As the Advocate General stated at point 59 of his Opinion, the present case involves 
a dual categorisation, in which the existence of an advantage is attributable, first, to a 
fixed element forming part of the special tax regime applied to FT, as opposed to the 
general law regime, and, second, to a variable element, which depends on factual cir
cumstances, namely the location of premises or land in the various local authorities 
and the tax rate applicable in those authorities. || P_A16
24
On account of its specific features, as described at paragraph 18 above, the special tax 
regime could have resulted in FT’s liability to tax being less than it would have been 
had it been subject to business tax under the general law regime. || P_A17
25
The fact that FT’s liability to professional tax was indeed lower as of 1994 is directly 
attributable to the specific features of the special tax regime applied to it, even though 
the exact amount of annual aid received by it under that regime depended on certain 
factors unrelated to the regime. || P_A18
26
It is also apparent from the structure of the judgment under appeal that paragraph 323 
of that judgment, which refers to circumstances unrelated to the special tax regime, 
concerns only the annual aid granted to FT under the special tax regime. || P_A19
In fact, that paragraph forms part of the analysis of the plea relating to the limitation 
in time of the Commission’s power to recover unlawful aid. || P_A20
The findings of the General Court 
in connection with that plea can relate only to aid actually received and, therefore, 
concern only the aid from which FT benefited under the special tax regime. || P_A21
27
It follows from those considerations that the General Court did not err in law in 
finding that the special tax regime conferred an advantage on FT for the purposes of 
Article 87(1) EC, even though the exact amount of aid granted under that regime had 
to be determined by reference to certain factors unrelated to the regime. || P_A22
28
The first ground of appeal is therefore unfounded. || C_A23
The second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court misconstrued the concept 
of State aid in that the Commission failed to take account of the overall tax regime 
applicable to FT during the years from 1991 to 2002

The second ground of appeal relied on by FT is subdivided into three parts. || NA
It is 
appropriate to examine, first, the second part, relating to the purported misinter­
pretation of the contested decision. || NA

2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
The second part of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court 
erred in law in its misinterpretation of the contested decision and substituted its own 
grounds
— Arguments of the parties
30
FT maintains that the General Court misinterpreted the contested decision by con
cluding that the Commission considered that the aid at issue did not consist in the 
special tax provisions applicable to that company but in the tax differential estab
lished each year between the amounts actually paid by the company and the business 
tax that would have been due under the general law regime, thus substituting its own 
grounds for those of the decision. || NA
FT also submits that that interpretation is incon
sistent with the enacting terms of the contested decision, according to which the aid 
at issue consists in the business tax scheme applicable to that company during the 
period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2002. || NA
The Commission therefore relied 
not on the fact that the tax differential established with effect from 1994 arose on an 
annual basis, but on other reasons of a different nature. || NA
31
The Commission argues in reply that the General Court’s reading of the contested 
decision in the judgment under appeal is consistent with the terms of the decision. || NA
It states that it was unnecessary to repeat in the enacting terms of the decision that 
the tax differential constituted an advantage. || NA
The aid from which FT benefited, which 
consisted in the under-taxation of that company as regards business tax between the 
years 1994 and 2002, was made available as a result of the business tax regime ap­
plicable to the company during that period. || NA

At paragraph 201 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the part 
of the contested decision which found that the aid derived from a tax differential rep
resenting the difference between the amount which FT would have had to pay by way 
of business tax contributions if it had been subject to the tax under the general law 
and the amount which it was actually charged under the tax regime at issue. || P_B1
The General Court verified that there was a genuine tax differential at paragraphs 219 to 225 
of the judgment, without its findings in that regard being called into question by FT. || P_B2
33
As regards the purported substitution of grounds on the part of the General Court, it 
is sufficient to note that the court did not exceed its powers of review in substituting 
its own assessment for that of the Commission, since the tax differential in question 
and the fact that the business tax is paid annually, as provided for in the General Tax 
Code, form an integral part of the reasoning adopted by the Commission in the contested decision. || P_B3
34
Recital 42 of the contested decision states that ‘the difference between the business 
tax actually paid by FT and that which should have been due under the ordinary law 
from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2003 constitutes State aid inasmuch as it represents 
an advantage for FT granted through resources which would otherwise have been 
incorporated in the budget of the State’. || P_B4
Recital 49 of the decision states that the pro
fessional tax was payable annually. || P_B5
Furthermore, the point is also made that business 
tax is payable annually at recital 25 of the decision initiating the formal investigation, 
to which recital 15 of the contested decision refers. || P_B6

Consequently, the General Court’s interpretation to the effect that the aid at issue 
consisted in the tax differential deriving from the application of the provisions estab
lishing a special regime is consistent with the enacting terms of the contested deci
sion, which categorises the regime applicable to FT between the years 1994 and 2002 
as aid which is incompatible with the common market. || P_B7
Indeed, it is by virtue of that 
special regime that FT was not required to pay business tax in the amounts for which 
it would normally have been liable under the general law tax regime. || P_B8
36
The second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected. || P_B9
The first and third parts of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General 
Court misconstrued the concept of State aid since it failed to carry out an overall 
analysis of the tax regime applicable to FT
— Arguments of the parties
37
FT submits that the General Court failed to have regard to the obligation to carry out 
a comprehensive examination of all the provisions under the regime which derogated 
from the general law. || NA
In order to determine whether there was an advantage, the Gen
eral Court should have compared the charges imposed under the derogating regime 
with the level of taxation that would have been applied to it if the company had been 
taxed under the general law regime. || NA
However, it confined that comparison to the 
period from 1994 to 2002, without taking account of the tax burden borne by FT dur
ing the period from 1991 to 1993. || NA
I  -  12967
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
38
FT is of the view that neither the fact that the tax is paid annually nor the differences 
between the two tax periods under consideration could justify a partial analysis con
fined to the tax regime applicable as of 1994. || NA
The General Court was therefore incor
rect in refusing to take account of the fact that the company was over-taxed as a result 
of the fixed levy during the period from 1991 to 1993 when compared with the level of 
taxation it would have had to bear if it had been subject to the general law on business 
tax during that period. || NA
Even if the General Court were entitled in its analysis to take 
account of the fact that the business tax is payable annually, it should have recognised 
that, as regards the initial tax years under the general derogating tax scheme, namely 
from the years 1991 to 1993, the company was over-taxed. || NA
39
FT is also of the view that the General Court erred in law in relying, at paragraph 207 
of the judgment under appeal, on Case C-66/02 Italy v Commission [2005] ECR 
I-10901. || NA
The General Court was incorrect in concluding, in reliance on that judg
ment, that FT benefited from a reduction in charges for the period from 1994 to 2002 
which could not be offset by a specific charge imposed on that company in respect of 
the period from 1991 to 1993. || NA
40
Similarly, the French Republic maintains that the General Court misconstrued the 
concept of advantage when it adopted a restrictive approach as regards the link 
that must exist between an exemption and a charge established by the tax regime at 
issue. || NA
The General Court should have undertaken an overall analysis covering both the 
derogating scheme established by Law No 90-568 – in particular any advantages con
ferred on FT by that scheme – and the charges payable by FT under the general law. || NA
41
The Commission submits that it is not possible to ‘offset’ aid by invoking charges 
of a different nature that are unconnected with the aid. || NA
That applies not only to the 
question of State resources but also that of the advantage conferred. || NA
A loss of State 
resources cannot be saved from categorisation as aid simply because such loss is ‘set 
off’ against other sums paid to the State in accordance with other obligations. || NA
Since 


I  -  12968
JUDGMENT OF 8. || NA
12. || NA
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
there is no sufficient connection between the tax scheme applicable between 1991 
and 1993 and the scheme in force as of 1994, the ‘offsetting’ supposition underlying 
FT’s argument is unfounded. || NA
— Findings of the Court
42
In the light of the arguments put forward by the parties, it is necessary to consider 
whether the General Court erred in law in finding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment 
under appeal, that the Commission had been correct in refusing in the contested 
decision to offset the amounts paid by FT by way of fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 
against the tax differentials arising from the special tax regime for the period from 
1994 to 2002, in order to determine whether that company benefited from State aid 
for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC. || P_B10
43
While recognising that, when examining a measure likely to constitute State aid, the 
Commission is entitled to take account of the specific charges imposed on an advan
tage, the General Court nevertheless found, at paragraph 207 of the judgment under 
appeal, that a measure cannot be saved from categorisation as aid where the aid 
beneficiary is subject to a specific charge which is different from and unconnected 
with the aid in question. || P_B11
That affirmation on the part of the General Court is based 
on a correct interpretation of Article 87(1) EC (see Case 173/73 Italy v Commission 
[1974] ECR 709, paragraph 34), notwithstanding the fact that it referred incorrectly 
in that regard to the judgment in Case C-66/02 Italy v Commission. || P_B12
I  -  12969
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
44
The General Court therefore did not err in law in finding, at paragraph 208 of the 
judgment under appeal, that the validity of the French Republic’s and FT’s argument 
that the over-taxation of FT between 1991 and 1993, attributable to the fixed levy to 
which it was subject, offset the tax differential from which that company benefited 
from 1994 to 2002 depends on the analysis of the objective characteristics of the fixed 
levy applicable between 1991 and 1993 and on whether it may be regarded as a charge 
which is connected with the advantage enjoyed by FT as a result of its being taxed 
under the special regime as of 1994. || P_B13
45
It should be noted that the levy applicable to FT between 1991 and 1993 was deter
mined by different parameters from those applied with effect from 1994 under the 
special tax regime. || P_B14
The two tax regimes were in fact based on different legal models 
and operating parameters. || P_B14bis
46
As is apparent from recital 17 of the contested decision and paragraph 209 of the 
judgment under appeal, under the tax scheme applicable to FT from 1991 to 1993, it 
did not have to pay any tax or levy other than the fixed levy. || P_B15
The amount of the fixed 
levy was established not in accordance with the parameters used to determine the 
amount of business tax but by reference to the earnings paid to the State by the entity 
from 1989 to 1990. || P_B16
The fixed levy was also temporary. || P_B17
47
On the other hand, under the special tax regime applicable from 1994 for an indef­
inite period, FT was required, in principle, to pay all the general law taxes. || P_B18
However, 
the rules governing its liability to business tax derogated from the general law and 
constituted the special tax regime. || P_B19
I  -  12970
JUDGMENT OF 8. || P_B20
12. || P_B20
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
48
In those circumstances, the General Court was entitled to find, at paragraph 213 of 
the judgment under appeal, that the fixed levy must be regarded not as a charge con
nected with the introduction of the special tax regime, but rather as a special tax 
mechanism for FT established for the years prior to 1994. || P_B20
In any event, as the General 
Court stated at paragraph 215 of the judgment under appeal, the mere fact that the 
fixed levy and the special tax regime were both introduced by Law No 90-568 does 
not prove that FT’s liability to pay the fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 was connected 
with the creation of the special tax regime for the years after 1994. || P_B21
49
The General Court did not, therefore, err in law in concluding, at paragraph 218 of 
the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was entitled to refuse to apply a set-
off between, on the one hand, the amounts paid by FT between 1991 and 1993 by way 
of fixed levy and, on the other, the tax differentials arising as a result of the special tax 
regime established for that company for the years 1994 to 2002. || P_B22
50
Lastly, even if it were the case that the tax regime applicable to FT consisted of two 
inextricably linked periods, the first entailing over-taxation and the second under-
taxation, it is accepted that Law No 90-568 introduced with effect from 1994 a special 
tax regime intended to be of indefinite duration. || P_B23
That law did not contain any mech-
anism for offsetting amounts due by way of fixed levy for the period from 1991 to 1993 
against amounts due as of 1994 under the special tax regime. || P_B24
It therefore provided no 
mechanism for determining the point at which over-taxation under the first regime 
should have been offset under the second regime. || P_B25
As the Advocate General observed 
at point 100 of his Opinion, that over-taxation should have exhausted its effects at a 
given time, which necessarily entailed the conferring of an advantage on FT under the 
special tax regime. || P_B26

The first and third parts of the second ground of appeal cannot therefore be upheld. || P_B27
Accordingly, the second ground must be rejected in its entirety. || C_B28
The third ground of appeal, alleging breach of the principle of the protection of 
legitimate expectations
52
The third ground of appeal put forward by FT comprises two parts. || NA
The first part of the third ground of appeal, alleging an error of law as regards the 
circumstances in which the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations may 
be relied on
— Arguments of the parties
53
FT claims, with regard to whether it is possible for it to rely on the principle of the 
protection of legitimate expectations, that the General Court erred in confining the 
situations in which it is possible to take account of certain exceptional circumstances 
to cases in which aid has been notified. || NA
The fact that, in the present case, it was pos
sible to identify the existence of an advantage only a posteriori, in the light of chang
ing circumstances unrelated to the special tax regime, constitutes such exceptional 
circumstances. || NA

54
FT states that the General Court did not identify either the legal act that should have 
been notified or the date on which notification should have occurred. || NA
If the advan
tage consisted in a tax differential established at the end of each tax year, it would be 
impossible to identify an obligation of prior notification of the tax regime at issue. || NA
55
FT adds that the General Court disregarded the fact that the intentions of the nation
al legislature were among the factors to be taken into consideration for the purpose of 
determining whether that company could have entertained a legitimate expectation 
that the tax measure at issue complied with the rules on State aid. || NA
56
The Commission states that undertakings receiving aid can, in principle, have a legit­
imate expectation that the aid will be deemed lawful only if it is granted in accordance 
with the procedure laid down in the EC Treaty. || NA
57
It submits that the special tax regime applicable to FT during the period from 1994 
to 2002 was introduced by way of derogation, was selective, attributable to the State 
and applied to a company active in markets open to competition and to trade between 
Member States. || NA
Consequently, the national authorities should have notified the spe
cial business tax regime applicable to that company before the date on which that tax 
became chargeable. || NA
— Findings of the Court
58
It should be recalled, first, that the obligation to notify is one of the fundamental fea
tures of the system of control put in place by the Treaty in the field of State aid. || P_C1
Under 
that system, Member States are under an obligation, first, to notify to the Commission 
each measure intended to grant new aid or alter aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) 


I  -  12973
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
EC and, second, not to implement such a measure, in accordance with Article 88(3) 
EC, until that institution has taken a final decision on the measure. || P_C2
59
Consequently, in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Com
mission, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain 
a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance 
with the procedure laid down in Article 88 EC and a diligent business operator should 
normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed. || P_C3
In particular, where aid is implemented without prior notification to the Commission, with the 
result that it is unlawful under Article 88(3) EC, the recipient of the aid cannot have at 
that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Joined Cases C-183/02 P 
and C-187/02 P Demesa and Territorio Histórico de Álava v Commission [2004] ECR 
I-10609, paragraphs 44 and 45 and case-law cited). || P_C4
60
Moreover, the Court has held that, where aid has not been notified to the Commis
sion, any apparent failure to act on its part in relation to the measure is irrelevant (see 
Demesa and Territorio Histόrico de Álava v Commission, paragraph 52). || P_C5
61
With regard to the present dispute, it is accepted that the tax regime at issue, which 
was introduced by Law No 90-568, was not notified to the Commission. || P_C6
62
In so far as FT argues that there was no obligation to notify, because it had not been 
established that there was an advantage, it should be noted that neither the purported 
complexity of the tax regime at issue nor the periodic nature of the aid measure can 
release the Member State from its obligation to notify or give rise to any legitimate 
expectation on the part of the company receiving the aid. || P_C7

63
As regards the possible relevance of exceptional circumstances which may give rise, 
notwithstanding the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, to a legit­
imate expectation that aid is lawful, it is sufficient to note that the General Court did 
not err in law in assessing such circumstances in the course of its detailed examin­
ation, at paragraphs 263 to 269 of the judgment under appeal, of all the arguments 
relied on before it in that regard. || P_C8
64
Consequently, the General Court concluded correctly, at paragraph 270 of the judg
ment under appeal, that the French Republic and FT had failed to prove the existence 
of exceptional circumstances enabling them to rely on the principle of the protection 
of legitimate expectations. || P_C9

unfounded. || C_C10
The second part of the third ground of appeal, alleging an error in law as to the legal 
consequences flowing from another Commission decision on State aid

FT is of the view that the General Court misinterpreted the legal consequences flow

67
FT submits that that decision was a positive act capable of producing legal effects and 
giving rise to a legitimate expectation that the tax regime at issue complied with the 
rules on State aid. || NA
68
The Commission states that, since the special tax regime constituted a procedure 
for imposing business tax which derogated from the general law, it was capable of 
conferring an advantage on FT. || NA
In view of that regime’s particular characteristics, 
notification should have taken place no later than the date on which the business tax 
for which that company was liable for 1994 became chargeable. || NA
69
The Commission considers that another State aid investigation procedure could not 
give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of FT concerning the special tax re
gime from which it benefited. || NA
— Findings of the Court || NA
70
As stated at paragraphs 59 and 60 above, the recipient of aid cannot, in principle, rely 
on considerations based on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations 
where the aid in question has not been notified to the Commission. || P_D1
71
The argument based on the La Poste decision does not contain any analysis of the 
special business tax regime applicable to FT. || P_D2
Accordingly, the General Court could 
do no other than point out, at paragraph 266 of the judgment under appeal, that the 
Commission had expressed no opinion at all on that special tax regime and had not, 
therefore, taken a view on whether it constituted aid. || P_D3
72
As regards the argument that FT could have interpreted the context in which the La 
Poste decision was adopted as a definition of the Commission’s opinion on the tax re
gime at issue, it must be noted that the General Court, without erring in law, rejected 
that argument at paragraphs 265 to 269 of the judgment under appeal. || P_D4
73
Consequently, the General Court was entitled to find that there was nothing of 
relevance in the La Poste decision that could have given rise to any legitimate ex­
pectation on the part of FT that the tax regime at issue was lawful in the light of 
the rules on State aid. || P_D5

unfounded. || C_D6

75
FT states that the French authorities explained, in the course of the administrative 
procedure, that any under-taxation during the period from 1994 to 2002 could not, in 
any event, be recovered, given that the tax regime at issue was introduced more than

According to FT, the General Court failed to adjudicate on the principle of limitation 
thus relied on before it. || NA
Instead, it substituted its own grounds in that regard for those 
of the contested decision. || NA
Moreover, the judgment under appeal did not specify the 
binding legal act which determined the point at which the limitation period began to 
run. || NA
The act which triggered the limitation period was Law No 90-568. || NA
77
The French Republic maintains that the General Court erred in law in finding that 
the limitation period in respect of the aid at issue could not have started to run be
fore 1994. || NA
Even if it were accepted that the special tax regime constituted State aid, 
the only binding legal act identifiable for the purpose of determining the point at 
which the limitation period started to run as regards the measure in question was 
Law No 90-568, which entered into force on 2 July 1990. || NA
The Commission decided to 
initiate the preliminary investigation procedure relating to FT’s special tax regime by 
sending a request for information to the French authorities on 28 June 2001. || NA
By that 
date, the limitation period pertaining to the Commission’s duty to recover aid had 
expired. || NA
78
The Commission submits that the General Court was required to determine only 
whether recovery of the aid granted to FT under the special business tax regime in 
force from 1994 was time-barred. || NA

Findings of the Court
80
As regards the principle of limitation, Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 pro
vides that the powers of the Commission to recover aid are to be subject to a limita
tion period of 10 years. || P_E1
It is apparent from Article 15(2) of the regulation that the 
limitation period does not begin to run until on the day on which the unlawful aid 
is awarded to the beneficiary. || P_E2
Consequently, the decisive factor in determining the 
starting point of the limitation period referred to in Article 15 is when the aid was in 
fact granted. || P_E3
81
It is apparent from Article 15(2) of Regulation No 659/1999 that, for the purpose 
of determining the date on which the limitation period starts to run, that provision 
refers to the grant of aid to a beneficiary, not the date on which an aid scheme was 
adopted. || P_E4
82
The determination of the date on which aid was granted may vary depending on the 
nature of the aid in question. || P_E5
Thus, in the case of a multi-annual scheme, entailing 
payments or advantages granted on a periodic basis, the date on which an act forming 
the legal basis of the aid is adopted and the date on which the undertakings concerned 
will actually be granted the aid may be a considerable period of time apart. || P_E6
In such 
a case, for the purpose of calculating the limitation period, the aid must be regarded 


I  -  12979
FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION
as not having been awarded to the beneficiary until the date on which it was in fact 
received by the beneficiary. || P_E7
83
It should be noted that, at recital 49 of the contested decision, the Commission stated 
that the limitation period started to run each year on the date on which the business 
tax was due from FT. || P_E8
84
As is apparent from paragraph  320 of the judgment under appeal, the limitation 
period starts to run afresh each time an advantage is actually granted, which may be 
on an annual basis, so that the calculation of the limitation period may depend on 
how the advantage is identified. || P_E9
85
In the present case, since the finding as to whether aid existed depended on the differ
ent rates applicable in each municipality within whose territory FT’s establishments 
were situated, the General Court carried out an analysis, at paragraph 323 of the 
judgment under appeal, of the fact that business tax is charged annually and the con
sequences flowing from this. || P_E10
86
The General Court was therefore correct in finding, at paragraph 324 of the judgment 
under appeal, that, in view of the annual nature of business tax, the aid at issue could 
not be regarded as having been awarded before the year 1994, because that was the 
year in which the binding legal acts were adopted which made it possible, for the first 
time, to establish the existence of a tax differential. || P_E11

JUDGMENT OF 8. || NA

Moreover, the approach adopted by the General Court is confirmed by the wording of 
Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, from which it is apparent that it is the Com
mission’s powers to recover aid which are subject to a limitation period. || P_E12
88
Lastly, as regards the argument that the General Court failed to have regard to the ob
ligation to state reasons in relation to the principle of limitation, it is settled case-law 
that that court is not thereby required to provide an account that follows exhaustively 
and point by point all the reasoning articulated by the parties to the case. || P_E13
The reason
ing may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to 
know why the measures in question were taken and provides the competent court 
with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see Case C-105/04 P 
Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Electrotechnisch Gebied 
v Commission [2006] ECR I-8725, paragraph 72; and Case C-3/06 P Groupe Danone 
v Commission [2007] ECR I-1331, paragraph 46). || P_E14
89
It should be noted in that connection that, at paragraphs 323 and 324 of the judg
ment under appeal, the General Court provided a clear assessment of the character
istics of the business tax scheme, which enabled it to conclude, at paragraph 325 of 
the judgment, that the limitation period provided for under Article 15 of Regulation 
No 659/1999 had not expired by 28 June 2001, the date on which a request for infor
mation was sent to the French Republic. || P_E15
90
In those circumstances, the Court finds that the General Court responded to the 
requisite legal standard to the arguments relating to the principle of limitation relied 
on by FT and did not disregard the requirement to state reasons established in the 
case-law cited at paragraph 88 above. || P_E16
91
In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the fourth ground of appeal cannot be 
accepted. || C_E17

The fifth ground of appeal, alleging an error of law and failure to state reasons in the

The fifth ground of appeal relied on by FT comprises two parts. || NA
Arguments of the parties
— The first part of the fifth ground of appeal, alleging failure to state reasons and 
error of law on account of the fact that it is impossible to establish the amount of aid 
to be recovered
93
FT claims that the General Court failed to respond to its argument that, where the 
Commission examines an advantage the true amount of which cannot be established, 
it cannot order recovery of such an advantage. || NA
94
FT infers from this that the General Court infringed the principle of legal certainty 
since any amount to be recovered remains hypothetical and the quantification of re
coverable aid cannot be based on approximate estimates. || NA

2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
— The second part of the fifth ground of appeal, alleging failure to state reasons and 
error of law as regards the assessment of the methods of obtaining an approximate 
amount of the aid
95
FT submits that the General Court erred in law by finding, at paragraphs 297 and 305 
of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was justified in establishing a 
range encompassing the amount of aid to be recovered on the basis of estimates pro
vided by the French authorities and that breach of the principle of legal certainty 
could not therefore be established. || NA
96
FT explains that the estimates in question were not forwarded by the French au
thorities with a view to determining the actual extent of the tax differential during 
the period from 1994 to 2002. || NA
Those calculations were provided to demonstrate that 
any under-taxation of the company during that period was offset by the over-taxation 
which occurred during the first years of the special tax regime, namely during the 
period from 1991 to 1993. || NA
97
In its response to the two parts of the fifth ground of appeal, the Commission submits 
that, in its findings concerning the principle of legal certainty, the General Court sim
ply drew the appropriate conclusions from a number of elements in the judgment in 
Case C-441/06 Commission v France [2007] ECR I-8887. || NA
98
The Commission therefore considers that the General Court gave appropriate rea
sons for its conclusion that FT was not justified in its submission that the principle of 
legal certainty had been infringed on the sole ground that, in order for the aid at issue 
to be recovered, it was necessary to specify the amount of aid. || NA

Findings of the Court
99
On account of the connection between them, it is appropriate to examine both parts 
of the fifth ground of appeal together. || NA
100
The principle of legal certainty – which is one of the general principles of European 
Union law – requires that rules of law be clear and precise and predictable in their 
effect, so that interested parties can ascertain their position in situations and legal 
relationships governed by European Union law (see, to that effect, Case C-63/93 
Duff and Others [1996] ECR I-569, paragraph 20; Case C-76/06 P Britannia Alloys 
& Chemicals v Commission [2007] ECR I-4405, paragraph 79; and Case C-158/07 
Förster [2008] ECR I-8507, paragraph 67). || P_F1
101
As regards the argument relied on in support of the fifth ground of appeal, it should be 
observed that the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 301 of the judgment under 
appeal, that, on the basis of the Commission’s estimates, the aid at issue amounted 
to between EUR 798 million and EUR 1 140 million. || P_F2
Since those figures delimit the 
range within which the final amount was to be established, the General Court found, 
referring in particular to paragraphs 31 to 40 of Commission v France, that the con
tested decision contained the appropriate information to enable that amount to be 
determined without too much difficulty. || P_F3
102
It should also be noted that the Court of Justice held, at paragraph 29 of Commission 
v France, that no provision of European Union law requires the Commission, when 
ordering the recovery of aid declared incompatible with the common market, to fix 
the exact amount of the aid to be recovered. || P_F4
It is sufficient for the Commission’s de
cision to include information enabling the recipient to calculate the amount itself, 
without overmuch difficulty (see also Case C-480/98 Spain v Commission [2000] ECR 
I-8717, paragraph 25, and Case C-415/03 Commission v Greece [2005] ECR I-3875, 
paragraph 39). || P_F5

JUDGMENT OF 8. || P_F6
12. || P_F6
2011 — CASE C-81/10 P
103
Thus, the General Court stated, at paragraphs 302 and 303 of the judgment under ap
peal, that that range was based on estimates provided by the French authorities dur
ing the administrative procedure and that, since that Member State had been unable 
to calculate exactly the amount of the advantage from which FT had benefited under 
the regime at issue, the Commission was entitled to rely on the data thus provided. || P_F6
104
In those circumstances, the General Court correctly concluded, at paragraph 305 of 
the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision did not constitute a breach of 
the principle of legal certainty. || P_F7
105
It follows from the foregoing that neither the French Republic nor FT can rely on that 
principle in order to prevent recovery of unlawful aid (see Case C-148/04 Unicredito 
Italiano [2005] ECR I-11137, paragraph 104). || P_F8
106
The General Court was therefore entitled to find that the contested decision is not 
vitiated by unlawfulness because it simply refers to an indicative range as regards the 
amount of aid to be recovered. || P_F9
107
Moreover, it is apparent from paragraphs 301 to 305 of the judgment under appeal 
that the judgment is not vitiated by an inadequate statement of reasons as regards the 
assessment of the plea alleging breach of the principle of legal certainty raised by FT 
and the French Republic. || P_F10
108
The fifth ground of appeal relied on by FT cannot succeed and it must therefore be 
rejected in its entirety. || C_F11
