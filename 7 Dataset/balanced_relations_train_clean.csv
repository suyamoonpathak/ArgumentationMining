"Last, the situation at issue in the present case is not comparable to the situation in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra (C-379/98, EU:C:2001:160), in which the Court held that the obligation imposed on private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced from renewable energy sources at fixed minimum prices did not involve any direct or indirect transfer of State resources to undertakings which produced that type of electricity (see judgments of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra, C-379/98, EU:C:2001:160, paragraph 59; of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C-206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 74; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colre! and Others, C-262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 34).","The latter case related to private undertakings that had not been appointed by the State to administer a State resource, but were bound by an obligation to purchase by means of their own financial resources (see judgments of 17 July 2008, Essent Netwerk Noord and Others, C-206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 74; of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colre! and Others, C-262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 35; and order of 22 October 2014, Elcogs, C-275/13, not published, EU:C:2014:2314, paragraph 32).",support,premise,premise,A2017_European Commission v TV2_Danmark A_S

"The Court must therefore ascertain whether, as the Commission claims, the General Court’s reasoning is vitiated by an error of law.","By the first part of this ground of appeal, the Commission challenges the interpretation of the concepts of ‘new aid’ and ‘existing aid’, within the meaning of Article 1(b) and (c) of Regulation No 659/1999, on which the General Court’s reasoning in paragraphs 74 to 91 of the judgment under appeal is based.",support,premise,premise,A2017_European Commission v Italian Republic_DT

"It may be added that respect for that division of powers prompted recital 5 of Decision 2001/224, which was in force in the period for which the contested decision orders the recovery of aid, to state that Decision 2001/224 was to be without prejudice to the outcome of any procedures that might be undertaken under Articles 87 EC and 88 EC and that it did not override ‘the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission …’.",The Commission shall inform the other Member States of the proposed measure within one month.,no-relation,premise,non-argumentative,A2013_European Commission v Ireland and Others
"Further, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 30 June 2016, Belgium v Commission, C-270/15 P, EU:C:2016:489, paragraphs 49 and 50).","First, it must be recalled that, according to the Court's settled case-law, classification of a national measure as 'State aid', within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.",support,premise,premise,A2016_European_Commission_v_World_Duty_Free
"It follows from the above that, where aid was granted under the ECSC Treaty without having been notified, a delay by the Commission in exercising its supervisory powers and ordering recovery of the aid does not render that recovery decision unlawful, except in exceptional cases which show that the Commission manifestly failed to act and clearly breached its duty of diligence.","It follows that, even in a situation in which the Community legislature has not expressly laid down any period of limitation, the Commission cannot indefinitely delay the exercise of its power.",support,premise,premise,A2008_Commission of the European Communities v Salzgitter AG

The appellant puts forward four grounds of appeal. The first is that the Court of First Instance applied the Albany judgment too broadly in concluding that the appellant’s competitive position was not affected by the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue. The second is that the Court of First Instance erred in law by finding that the appellant could not rely on the social aspects of the Community guidelines to establish that it was individually concerned by the contested decision. The third is that the Plaumann and Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum judgments were misapplied in that the Court of First Instance found that the appellant could not be regarded as individually concerned merely because the aid resulting from the fiscal measures at issue was passed on to the recipients by means of a reduction in the wage claims of the seafarers benefiting from the income tax exemption. The fourth is that the Court of First Instance misapplied the Van der Kooy and Others and CIRFS and Others line of case-law by concluding that the appellant’s own interests as a negotiator were not affected by the fiscal measures at issue.,"It has held that certain associations of economic operators which have played a significant role in the procedure under that provision must be recognised as individually concerned by such a decision, in so far as they are affected in their capacity as negotiators (see, to that effect, Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others, paragraphs 40 to 42).",no-relation,non-argumentative,premise,A2009_3F v Commission of the European Communities

"First, in examining the question whether the measures covered by the TV2 I decision involved State resources, the General Court held that the Commission had failed to state in its decision the reasons why it took advertising revenue for 1995 and 1996 into consideration, de facto, in order to decide whether or not State resources were involved. Second, the General Court held that the Commission's examination as to whether the second and fourth Altmark conditions had been met was not supported by serious analysis of the specific legal and economic considerations which governed how the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2/Danmark was set. The TV2 I decision was consequently vitiated by a failure to state sufficient reasons on that point. Third, the General Court held that the Commission's findings on the compatibility of the aid under Article 106(2) TFEU, in particular on whether or not there had been overcompensation, were also vitiated by a failure to state reasons. According to the General Court, that failure to state sufficient reasons was attributable to the failure to undertake a serious examination of the specific legal and economic conditions which governed the setting of the amount of the licence fee income payable to TV2/Danmark during the period under investigation.","Accordingly, the concept of intervention 'through State resources', within the meaning of that provision, is intended to cover, in addition to advantages granted directly by the State, those granted through a public or private body appointed or established by that State to administer the aid (see judgments of 13 March 2001, PreussenElektra, C-379/98, EU:C:2001:160, paragraph 58; of 30 May 2013, Doux levage and Cooprative agricole UKL-ARREE, C-677/11, EU:C:2013:348, paragraph 26; and of 19 December 2013, Association Vent De Colre! and Others, C-262/12, EU:C:2013:851, paragraph 20).",no-relation,non-argumentative,premise,A2017_European Commission v TV2_Danmark A_S

The simultaneous introduction of the two rates is not a question of a 'technique of intervention', as suggested by the General Court. Indeed, Ireland could not have envisaged a single rate of EUR 10 per passenger and it is for that reason that it subsequently chose to replace the two rates of ATT by a single rate of EUR 3 per passenger. Ryanair adds that the fact that the lower rate of ATT was applied less frequently is not sufficient for it to be possible to rule out the use of that rate as the reference rate, the frequency of taxable events subject to a given rate of tax being but one factor among others to be taken into consideration.","As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 41 of his Opinion, that assessment cannot be carried out by comparing the amount which the airlines subject to the lower rate of ATT were required to pay with a hypothetical tax amount, calculated on the basis or a rate which, as Ryanair itself accepts, did not apply to any flight or any airline during the period covered by the decision at issue.",no-relation,non-argumentative,premise,A2016_European Commission v Aer Lingus Ltd and Ryanair Designated Activity Company

"Such payment facilities constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU where, taking account of the significance of the economic advantage thereby granted, the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty (see, to that effect, Spain v Commission, paragraph 46; DM Transport, paragraph 30, and Commission v EDF, paragraph 79).","That assessment is made when a public creditor grants payment facilities in respect of a debt payable to it by an undertaking, by applying, in principle, the private creditor test.",support,premise,premise,A2013_Frucona Košice a.s. v European Commission

It follows moreover from that judgment that the identification of a derogation from an ordinary system is not an end in itself. All that matters is the actual effect of the measure, namely the fact that it does or does not benefit specific undertakings or the production of specific goods.","It was therefore for the Commission to establish that that measure, notwithstanding that it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or on certain sectors of activity.",no-relation,non-argumentative,premise,A2016_European_Commission_v_World_Duty_Free

"So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which is a constituent factor in the concept of 'State aid', within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that the assessment of that condition requires a determination whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour 'certain undertakings or the production of certain goods' over other undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and who accordingly suffer different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory (see, inter alia, judgments of 28 July 2011, Mediaset v Commission, C-403/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:533, paragraph 36; of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C-106/09 P and C-107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 75 and 101; and of 14 January 2015, Eventech, C-518/13, EU:C:2015:9, paragraphs 53 to 55; and of 4 June 2015, Commission v MOL, C-15/14 P, EU:C:2015:362, paragraph 59).","First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.",support,premise,premise,A2016_European_Commission_v_World_Duty_Free

"If the Court upholds the cross-appeal brought by Salzgitter, there will be no need to rule on the main appeal, which will become redundant. Therefore, the cross-appeal must be examined first.","Also, it is clear from consistent case-law that Articles 4 CS and 67 CS concern two distinct areas, the first abolishing and prohibiting certain actions by Member States in the field which the ECSC Treaty places under Community jurisdiction, the second intended to prevent the distortion of competition which exercise of the residual powers of the Member States inevitably entails (see Banks, paragraph 88, and the case-law cited there).",no-relation,non-argumentative,premise,A2008_Commission of the European Communities v Salzgitter AG
"Therefore, in paragraph 118 of that judgment, it concluded that, ‘since it is the investors, and not the EIGs, that benefited from the tax and economic advantages resulting from the STL system, it is appropriate to examine … whether the advantages obtained by the investors are selective, are liable to distort competition and affect trade between Member States and whether the [decision at issue] contains a sufficient statement of reasons concerning the analysis of those criteria.’","In the present case, in upholding the plea, raised by the Kingdom of Spain, and Lico Leasing and PYMAR, that the Commission had infringed Article 107(1) TFEU, in so far as the conditions relating to selectivity, the risk of distortion of competition and the effect on trade had not been fulfilled, since those conditions must be established, in their opinion, only with regard to the advantages obtained by the investors, the General Court, in paragraph 116 of the judgment under appeal, found that, although the EIGs had benefited from the three tax measures referred to in Article 1 of the decision at issue, it was the members of the EIGs who had benefited from the economic advantages arising from those three measures as a result of the tax transparency of the EIGs, and who were, moreover, referred to in the order for recovery imposed in Article 4(1) of that decision.",support,premise,premise,A2018_Commission v Spain
"Finally, the Commission relies on the case-law of the Court of Justice, according to which, when it is apparent from the very circumstances in which the aid is granted that the aid is capable of affecting trade between Member States and distorting or threatening to distort competition, the Commission may confine itself to setting out those circumstances in the statement of reasons for its decision.","With regard to the reasons in recitals 76 and 78 of the contested decision, the Court of First Instance found at paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal that they were ‘information which make it possible to show that Wam is active on the global and Community market, that it was engaged in trade, in particular [by means of] its exports, and that it competes with other undertakings’.",no-relation,non-argumentative,non-argumentative,R2006_European Commission v Italian Republic
"The Court accordingly held that a preferential rediscount rate for exports constitutes aid which, in the case in point, had to be authorised by the Commission under Article 67(2) CS in so far as it concerned the industry covered by the ECSC Treaty (see Commission v France, paragraph 44).","The Commission submits that the authorisation granted by that decision, which was adopted on the basis of the EEC Treaty, could have no effect under the ECSC Treaty, and that aid to steel undertakings provided for under the ZRFG was prohibited before publication of the First Steel Aid Code (Commission v France, paragraphs 41 to 44). The Commission submits that the authorisation contained in the 1971 Decision and the authorisations which followed only became applicable to steel undertakings by reason of that code and that that general authorisation, which was temporary, expired on 31 December 1981, the date that code expired (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-74/00 P and C‑75/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission [2002] ECR I‑7869, paragraphs 115 and 116).",no-relation,premise,non-argumentative,A2008_Commission of the European Communities v Salzgitter AG

"In the light of the case-law referred to in paragraphs 35 to 37 above, it follows that the tax measures at issue were such as to constitute State aid in favour of the EIGs and that therefore, by not acknowledging that the EIGs were beneficiaries of those measures on the ground that those entities were fiscally transparent, the General Court held that they could not be the beneficiaries of State aid solely because of their legal form and the relevant rules on the taxation of profits.","Thus, measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges that are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which therefore, without being subsidies in the strict meaning of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect are considered to constitute aid (judgment of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs 65 and 66 and the case-law cited).",support,premise,premise,A2018_Commission v Spain
"In that context, it should be noted, in particular, that although it follows from the case-law cited in paragraphs 50 and 53 of this judgment that such effects can, in principle, result from the fact that the beneficiary of an aid is active on a liberalised European market, the fact remains that in the circumstances of this case and contrary to the circumstances giving rise to those cases, the aid at issue is not directly connected to the activity of the beneficiary on that market, but is intended to finance expenditure for a non-member State market penetration programme.",The Commission contends that the involvement of Wam in intra-Community trade shows by itself the effect that the subsidy could have on that trade.,no-relation,premise,non-argumentative,R2006_European Commission v Italian Republic

It follows from the foregoing that the General Court did not err in law in holding that the tax on pay-television operators is not part of the aid scheme benefiting RTVE.,"According to settled case-law, in order for a tax to be regarded as forming an integral part of an aid measure, it must be hypothecated to the aid under the relevant national rules, in the sense that the revenue from the tax is necessarily allocated to the financing of the aid and has a direct impact on the amount of the aid and, consequently, on the assessment of the compatibility of that aid with the internal market (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 June 2006, Air Liquide Industries Belgium, C‑393/04 and C‑41/05, EU:C:2006:403, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited, and of 22 December 2008, Régie Networks, C‑333/07, EU:C:2008:764, paragraph 99).",support,premise,premise,R2016_DTS Distribuidora de Televisión Digital

"Since it cannot be ruled out that organisations representing the workers of the undertakings benefiting from aid may, as parties concerned within the meaning of that provision of the Treaty, submit observations to the Commission on considerations of a social nature which it can take into account if appropriate, the circumstance that the Court of First Instance did not in fact address the appellant’s argument relating to the social aspects of the fiscal measures at issue with regard to the Community guidelines means that the order under appeal must be set aside on this point.","It should be noted, to begin with, that, when assessing the compatibility of State aid in the maritime transport sector such as the aid at issue in the present case, the social aspects of the Community guidelines may be taken into account by the Commission as part of an overall assessment which includes a large number of considerations of various kinds, linked in particular to the protection of competition, the Community’s maritime policy, the promotion of Community maritime transport, or the promotion of employment (see, to that effect, Case C‑106/98 P Comité d’entreprise de la Société française de production and Others v Commission [2000] ECR I‑3659, paragraph 52).",support,conclusion,premise,A2009_3F v Commission of the European Communities
"Consequently, it must be observed that the legislative alteration referred to in paragraph 42 above had the effect of transforming the aid scheme authorised by the Council decision into new and unlawful aid.","Thus, aid which was the subject of an authorisation decision and which, as a result of an alteration that did not satisfy a condition laid down by that decision in order to ensure the compatibility of that aid with the internal market, is no longer covered by the decision which authorised it, may constitute new aid.",support,premise,premise,A2017_European Commission v Italian Republic_DT
"In the light of the terms of Decision 93/337, the appellant cannot therefore claim the possibility, which cannot be excluded (see Commission v Germany, cited above, paragraph 16), for the recipient of unlawful aid to rely on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful.",It is thus apparent that Demesa could not infer from Decision 93/337 that a tax credit of 45% granted to an undertaking of a size allowing it to make a minimum investment of ESP 2 500 million required by the Sixth Additional Provision of Norma Foral 22/1994 could not be categorised as aid for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.,support,premise,premise,R2004_Daewoo Electronics Manufacturing España SA and Territorio Histórico de Álava - Diputación Foral de Álava v Commission of the European Communities
