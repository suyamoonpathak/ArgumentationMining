"As a preliminary point, it must be observed that the Commission has abandoned its claims made in the alternative for the contested judgment to be set aside in so far as it partially annulled the contested decision.",prem
"It must be recalled that Article 173 of the Treaty, by virtue of which the Court of Justice is to review the legality of Community acts, provides that any natural or legal person may on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers institute proceedings against a decision addressed to that person or against a decision which, although in the form of a regulation or a decision addressed to another person, is of direct and individual concern to the former.",prem
"Where a decision is not of individual concern to a natural or legal person within the meaning of that provision, which is an essential condition for having locus standi in proceedings seeking judicial review of a Community act, such proceedings are inadmissible and that inadmissibility therefore constitutes a ground involving a question of public policy which may, and even must, be raised of its own motion by the Community judicature (see, with regard to a party having no interest in bringing or in maintaining an appeal, Case C‑19/93 P Rendo and Others v Commission [1995] ECR I‑3319, paragraph 13).",prem
"According to settled case‑law, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may only claim to be individually concerned if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually just as in the case of the person addressed (see, inter alia, judgments in Case 25/62 Plaumann v Commission [1963] ECR 95; Case C‑321/95 P Greenpeace Council and Others v Commission [1998] ECR I‑1651, paragraphs 7 and 28, and Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, cited above, paragraph 32).",prem
"The Court has thus held that an undertaking cannot, in principle, contest a Commission decision prohibiting a sectoral aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme.",prem
"Such a decision is, vis-à-vis the undertaking should it seek to contest the decision, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (Van der Kooy and Others v Commission, cited above, paragraph 15; Case C-6/92 Federmineraria and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I‑6357, paragraph 14, and Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, paragraph 33).",prem
"However, it is appropriate to recall the position adopted by the Court in the judgment in Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission with regard to Commission Decision 98/95/EC of 21 October 1997 concerning aid granted by the Region of Sardinia (Italy) to shipping companies in Sardinia (OJ 1998 L 20, p. 30), which required the Italian Republic to recover from each beneficiary of the loans and leases in question the element of aid which they contained.",prem
"In paragraphs 34 and 35 of that judgment, the Court held that, since Sardegna Lines was not only concerned by Decision 98/95 by virtue of being an undertaking in the shipping sector in Sardinia and a potential beneficiary of the aid scheme for Sardinian shipowners, but also by virtue of being an actual beneficiary of individual aid granted under that scheme, the recovery of which had been ordered by the Commission, it was individually concerned by that decision and its action directed against that decision was admissible.",prem
"Contrary to what the Commission claims, that is precisely the case here, since the applicants are in a different position from that of applicants for whom a Commission decision is in the nature of a measure of general application.",prem
"The former are not only concerned by the contested decision by virtue of being undertakings in the road haulage sector in the region and potential beneficiaries of the aid scheme in question, but also by virtue of being actual recipients of individual aid granted under that scheme, the recovery of which has been ordered by the Commission .",prem
"As paragraphs 10 and 11 of the contested judgment show, the number of applications accepted and the amount budgeted for the aid in question during the periods from 1981 to 1985 and from 1985 to 1995 were specified in section II of the reasons for the contested decision and the Commission must therefore have known of the existence of those actual recipients.",prem
"Since it follows from the foregoing that, in this case, the actions brought by the applicants were admissible, the Court of First Instance did not err in law by not raising of its own motion, as a ground of inadmissibility, the point that those applicants were not individually concerned by the contested decision.",prem
"It must be noted in that regard that Article 92(1) of the Treaty defines the aid regulated by it as being any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, in so far as it affects trade between Member States.",prem
The procedural rules laid down by the Treaty vary depending on whether aid is existing aid or new aid.,prem
"With regard to existing aid, under the provisions of Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, in the context of its constant review of such aid, if, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that that aid is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 92 of the Treaty, or that such aid is being misused, it is to decide that the State concerned must abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.",prem
"Such aid may therefore be lawfully put into effect as long as the Commission has not found it to be incompatible (see judgments in Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 23 and 25, and Banco Exterior de España, cited above, paragraph 20).",prem
"With regard to new aid, Article 93(3) of the Treaty provides that the Commission is to be informed, in sufficient time to enable it to submit its comments, of any plans to grant or alter aid.",prem
It then undertakes an initial examination of the planned aid.,prem
"If, following that examination, it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the common market, it must without delay initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2 of that article.",prem
"In such circumstances, the Member State concerned must not put its proposed measures into effect until the procedure has resulted in a final decision.",prem
"New aid is therefore subject to a precautionary review by the Commission and may not, in principle, be put into effect until such time as the latter has declared it compatible with the Treaty.",prem
"As the Court of First Instance held inter alia, in paragraphs 77 to 79 of the contested judgment, in the course of the Commission’s assessment of new aid which, pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty, is to be notified to it before being put into effect, the Commission is required to establish, not whether such aid has a real impact on trade between Member States and on competition, but whether that aid could affect that trade.",prem
"If the Commission had to demonstrate in its decision the real effect of aid already granted, such a requirement would have the effect of favouring Member States which grant aid in breach of the obligation to notify laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty, to the detriment of those which do notify aid at the planning stage (Case C-301/87 France v Commission [1990] ECR I-307, ‘Boussac Saint Frères’, paragraphs 32 and 33).",prem
"Consequently, the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 95 of the contested judgment, that it was not necessary to establish that certain Community undertakings had been adversely affected by the granting of the aid in dispute.",prem
"In the first place, it should be recalled that, according to settled case‑law, the relatively small amount of aid or the relatively small size of the undertaking which receives it do not as such exclude the possibility that intra-Community trade might be affected (see Case C-142/87 Belgium v Commission [1990] ECR I-959, ‘Tubemeuse’, paragraph 43; Joined Cases C‑278/92 to C‑280/92 Spain v Commission [1994] ECR I‑4103, paragraph 42, and Case C‑280/00 Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [2003] ECR I‑7747, paragraph 81).",prem
"Aid of a relatively small amount is liable to affect competition and trade between Member States where there is strong competition in the sector in which the undertakings which receive it operate (see Case 259/85 France v Commission [1987] ECR 4393, paragraph 24, and Case C‑351/98 Spain v Commission [2002] ECR I‑8031, paragraph 63).",prem
"The Court of First Instance, having declared that that case‑law applied to the present case, was fully entitled to hold, firstly, in paragraphs 84 and 86 of the contested judgment, that the small size of the recipient undertakings and the relatively small amount of aid allocated did not mean that there was no effect on competition and trade where, as in the road haulage sector, the presence of a large number of small‑sized undertakings was a feature of the market structure.",prem
"Secondly, as the Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 94 of the contested judgment, although hauliers from the Region played only a small part in that sector, the limited nature of the competition cannot preclude the application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",prem
"It therefore concluded, in the same paragraph, that the aid in dispute strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-à-vis their competitors and might accordingly affect trade between Member States.",prem
"Since the Italian Republic has not put forward any evidence that the Court of First Instance failed, in this case, to have regard to the principles recognised by the Court of Justice in the case‑law mentioned in paragraph 54 of the present judgment, that argument concerning the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade and competition must be rejected as unfounded.",prem
"In the second place, the argument put forward by the Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others that the Court of First Instance should have concluded that the international road haulage sector, characterised as it was by the existence of quotas and bilateral agreements, could not yet be regarded as being fully liberalised on the date of the contested decision and that, consequently, the aid in dispute could not be regarded as affecting competition, must be rejected as unfounded.",prem
"In paragraph 92 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance noted that, by virtue of the relevant provisions of Regulation No 1018/68, Community authorisations issued in the carrier’s name and usable only for one vehicle were granted under national quotas, for a period of one year in the case of international road haulage, holders of an international road haulage authorisation being entitled, during those periods of validity, to transport goods without limitation, with one vehicle, between Member States of their choice.",prem
"The Court of First Instance was therefore fully entitled to conclude that the quota schemes in force on the international road haulage market from 1969 to 1993 allowed the introduction, within the limit of the quotas laid down, of an effective competitive situation which was capable of being affected by the grant of the aid in dispute.",prem
"In that regard, the Court of First Instance was also fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 96 of the contested judgment, that, even assuming that the Community quota had been exhausted, that factor would not necessarily have led to the conclusion that the aid in dispute had no effect on intra-Community trade and competition.",prem
"In view of the free choice given by quota schemes to holders of Community authorisations as regards the Member States between which they may provide international haulage services, exhaustion of the quotas would in any event not furnish any information as to the use made of them, in particular in the case of such haulage services from or to Italy or, more specifically, the Region.",prem
"In the third place, according to settled case-law, the fact that a Member State seeks to approximate, by unilateral measures, conditions of competition in a particular sector of the economy to those prevailing in other Member States cannot deprive the measures in question of their character as aid (Joined Cases 6/69 and 11/69 Commission v France [1969] ECR 523, paragraphs 20 and 21, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 21).",prem
"It follows that the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 101 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute could be justified neither by the existence of higher discount rates in Italy nor by competition from operators established in Austria, Croatia or Slovenia.",prem
"The argument put forward by Collorigh and Others that the Court of First Instance should have ruled out the possibility that the system of aid in question strengthened the financial position of the recipient undertakings, since that aid was such as to compensate for that competition, must be rejected as unfounded.",prem
"In this case, as the Court of First Instance has already correctly pointed out in paragraph 5 of the contested judgment, the international road haulage sector had already been partially opened up to Community competition from 1969 onwards by Regulation No 1018/68 and has been fully liberalised since 1 January 1993.",prem
"The Court of First Instance inferred from that, in paragraph 94 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-à-vis their competitors and might accordingly affect trade between Member States.",prem
"Having been instituted in 1981 and 1985, that aid therefore came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of its introduction.",prem
"It follows that, in finding in paragraph 145 of the contested judgment that the aid in question had therefore to be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.",prem
"So far as concerns the fourth part of the first plea in law, alleging failure to state grounds for the contested judgment as regards the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade, it should be pointed out that the Court of First Instance set out in detail, in paragraphs 76 to 106 of the contested judgment, the reasons which had led the Commission to take the view that such aid was liable to affect trade between Member States and distort competition.",prem
"According to settled case‑law, correctly cited by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 169 of the contested judgment, abolishing unlawful aid by means of recovery is the logical consequence of a finding that it is unlawful.",prem
"Consequently, the recovery of State aid unlawfully granted, for the purpose of restoring the previously existing situation, cannot in principle be regarded as disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty in regard to State aids (see Tubemeuse, cited above, paragraph 66, and Case C‑169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 47).",prem
"By repaying the aid, the recipient forfeits the advantage which it had enjoyed over its competitors on the market, and the situation prior to payment of the aid is restored (see Case C‑350/93 Commission v Italy [1995] ECR I‑699, paragraph 22).",prem
"It also follows from that function of repayment of aid that, as a general rule, save in exceptional circumstances, the Commission will not exceed the bounds of its discretion, recognised by the case-law of the Court, if it asks the Member State to recover the sums granted by way of unlawful aid since it is only restoring the previous situation (see Case C‑75/97 Belgium v Commission [1999] ECR I‑3671, paragraph 66, and Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission [2002] ECR I‑2289, paragraph 99).",prem
"With regard to the argument put forward by Collorigh and Others that repayment of the aid in dispute would place a very heavy burden on the recipient undertakings, liable to cause many of them to disappear from the market and so giving rise to a serious employment and social crisis, making such recovery of the aid impossible in practice, it is sufficient to point out that the circumstances relied on by Collorigh and Others are by no means sufficient to demonstrate the impossibility of recovering the aid in dispute.",prem
They are merely potential internal difficulties.,prem
"In accordance with the case‑law of the Court, the apprehension of internal difficulties cannot justify a failure by a Member State to comply with its obligations under Community law (see, inter alia, Case C‑404/97 Commission v Portugal [2000] ECR I‑4897, paragraph 52; Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 105, and Case C‑404/00 Commission v Spain [2003] ECR I‑6695, paragraph 55).",prem
"In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to conclude, in paragraph 170 of the contested judgment, that no specific evidence had been put forward to show that the obligation to reimburse the aid in dispute is disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty.",prem
It must be pointed out that a recipient of illegally granted aid is not precluded from relying on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful and thus declining to refund that aid.,prem
"If such a case is brought before a national court, it is for that court to assess the material circumstances, if necessary after obtaining a preliminary ruling on interpretation from the Court of Justice (Case C‑5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I‑3437, paragraph 16, and Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 103).",prem
"In the present case, the Court of First Instance first of all found, in paragraph 172 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute had been granted without having been notified to the Commission beforehand, contrary to the obligation imposed on Member States by Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",prem
"Secondly, the Court of First was fully entitled to conclude, in the same paragraph of the contested decision, that the fact that the recipient undertakings are small undertakings cannot justify a legitimate expectation on their part as to the lawfulness of that aid.",prem
"Finally, in so far as the Italian Republic claims that, since the recipient undertakings had relied on the lawfulness of aid instituted and paid out over many years, the Court of First Instance should have concluded that that long period had given rise to legitimate expectations on the part of those recipients with regard to recovery of the aid in dispute, which, as the Court of Justice has already held, justified a temporal limitation of the power held by the Commission, it is sufficient to reply that, in order to fulfil its function, such a limitation period must be fixed in advance, the fixing of its duration and the detailed rules for its application coming within the powers of the Community legislature (see, to that effect, Case 52/69 Geigy v Commission [1972] ECR 787, paragraph 21).",prem
"On the date of the contested decision, the latter had not yet acted to fix a period of limitation in connection with the monitoring of aid granted under the Treaty, since Regulation No 659/1999, having only entered into force on 16 April 1999, does not apply to the facts of this case.",prem
"However, the fundamental requirement of legal certainty has the effect of preventing the Commission from indefinitely delaying the exercise of its powers (see Geigy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 20 and 21, and Joined Cases C‑74/00 P and C‑75/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission [2002] ECR I‑7869, paragraph 140).",prem
"In that regard, a delay by the Commission in deciding that an aid is illegal and must be abolished and recovered by a Member State could in certain circumstances establish a legitimate expectation on the part of the recipients of that aid so as to prevent the Commission from requiring that Member State to order the refund of the aid (see Case 223/85 RSV v Commission [1987] ECR 4617, paragraph 17).",prem
"However, the facts of the case giving rise to that judgment were exceptional and bear no resemblance to those in the present case.",prem
"The measure at issue in that judgment concerned a sector which had for some years been receiving State aid approved by the Commission and its object was to meet the additional costs of an operation which had already received authorised aid (Case C‑334/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I‑1139, paragraph 44).",prem
"In any event, in the case of State aid that has not been notified, such a delay may be imputed to the Commission only from the time when it learned of the existence of the aid incompatible with the common market.",prem
"In this case, it is common ground that the Commission learned of the aid in dispute only in September 1995.",prem
"In view, firstly, of the fact that such aid had not been authorised by the Commission and, secondly, of the fact that the Commission was not aware of the complex situation in which that aid had been granted, it was therefore necessary, before reaching a decision, to carry out an investigation.",prem
"In those circumstances, the time which elapsed between September 1995 and the date of adoption of the contested decision, namely 30 July 1997, is reasonable.",prem
"Consequently, the Court of First Instance cannot be considered to have failed to observe the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations in that regard.",prem
"Contrary to what the Italian Republic claims, the Court of First Instance, in paragraph 163 of the contested judgment, rightly found that Article 4 of the contested decision is worded equivocally as regards the requirement of recovery, which could refer either to all the aid in dispute granted since its introduction or only to the aid granted from 1 July 1990 onwards.",prem
"In any event, it should be pointed out that, in paragraph 163 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance started from the general principle that the operative part of an act is indissociably linked to the statement of reasons for it, so that, when it has to be interpreted, account must be taken of the reasons which led to its adoption (see, inter alia, Case C‑355/95 P TWD v Commission [1997] ECR I‑2549, paragraph 21, and Case C‑404/97 Commission v Portugal, cited above, paragraph 41).",prem
"In that regard, in paragraphs 164 and 166 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance concluded, firstly, that, in the light of the reasons for the contested decision, and in particular section VIII, last paragraph, of those reasons, Article 4 of that decision must be interpreted as meaning that the aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 with effect from 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid in dispute are incompatible with the common market.",prem
"Secondly, in paragraph 165 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance held that that interpretation is clear from a reading of the operative part of the contested decision taken as a whole.",prem
Such an analysis does not reflect an error of assessment on the part of the Court of First Instance.,prem
"Accordingly, the Commission’s cross‑appeal must be dismissed as unfounded.",conc
"This first part of the first plea, alleging that the Court of First Instance erred in law in interpreting Article 92(1) of the Treaty, must therefore be rejected as unfounded.",conc
"Accordingly, the second part of the first plea in law, relating to the impact of the aid in dispute on intra‑Community trade and competition, must be rejected in its entirety as unfounded.",conc
"Accordingly, the third part of the first plea in law, alleging an error of assessment of the aid in dispute as new aid, must be rejected.",conc
"Accordingly, the fourth part of the first plea in law, alleging failure to state grounds for the contested judgment, must be rejected as unfounded.",conc
"Accordingly, the first part of the second plea in law, by which the Italian Republic alleges that the Court of First Instance failed to observe the principle of proportionality, must be rejected.",conc
"Accordingly, the second part of the second plea in law must be rejected.",conc
"It follows that the third part of the second plea in law, relating to the extent of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute, must be rejected.",conc
