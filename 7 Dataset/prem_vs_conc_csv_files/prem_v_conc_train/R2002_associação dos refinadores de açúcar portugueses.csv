The Commission and DAI seek a declaration by the Court that the main appeal is clearly inadmissible since it does no more than repeat or reproduce verbatim the pleas in law relied on before the Court of First Instance and contains no specific legal argument for having the judgment under appeal set aside.,prem
"According to settled case-law, where an appeal merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the Court of First Instance, including those based on facts expressly rejected by that Court, it fails to satisfy the requirements under Article 51 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure.",prem
"In reality, such an appeal amounts to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the Court of First Instance, which, under Article 49 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice, falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (see, in particular, the order of 25 March 1998 in Case C-174/97 P FFSA and Others v Commission [1998] ECR I-1303, paragraph 24).",prem
"However, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of Community law by the Court of First Instance, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal (Case C-210/98 P Salzgitter v Commission [2000] ECR I-5843, paragraph 43).",prem
"Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the Court of First Instance, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose.",prem
"In the present case the main appeal, taken as a whole, specifically seeks to challenge the position adopted by the Court of First Instance on various points of law raised before it at first instance.",prem
It indicates clearly the aspects of the judgment under appeal which are criticised and the pleas in law and arguments on which it is based.,prem
"First, it is clear from reading paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal that they are not vitiated by any contradiction, contrary to the contention of the Commission.",prem
"To begin with, in paragraph 35, the Court of First Instance rejected the objection of inadmissibility raised by the Commission.",prem
In paragraph 36 it set out the reasons why it considered that the objection could not be upheld.,prem
"Whilst, at the end of paragraph 36, it deferred consideration of one question of admissibility, that question concerned the more specific allegation by the Commission that the objection that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal was itself inadmissible.",prem
The Court of First Instance analysed that separate question at paragraphs 44 to 50 of the judgment under appeal.,prem
The argument alleging a contradiction in the grounds thus cannot be upheld.,prem
"Second, as regards the appellants' interest in bringing proceedings against the part of the contested decision relating to tax reliefs, it is clear from the case-law of the Court of Justice, as the Commission points out, that individual grants of aid under a general aid scheme approved by the Commission which meet the conditions of that scheme constitute existing aid which does not need to be notified  (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 21 to 26).",prem
"Since it is not notified before it is implemented, such aid does not require an express decision by the Commission and its legality can only be assessed by the national courts (TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf, cited above, paragraphs 15 to 18).",prem
"However, the background to the present dispute is not the same.",prem
"It is clear from the documents on the Court file that the individual tax reliefs at issue were examined by the Commission, which had received complaints about them from the appellants.",prem
"The Commission took the view that those measures did comply with the two conditions laid down by the decision of 3 July 1991 for them to be classified as existing aid, exempt as such from formal notification and from examination of their compatibility with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.",prem
"In taking that position, the Commission did not confine itself to recording that the individual measures at issue were in the nature of existing aid.",prem
"Taking the view that those measures were covered by the decision of 3 July 1991, it also decided not to open the procedure provided for by Article 93(2) of the Treaty.",prem
"The appellants, who could have intervened as complainants in such a procedure if the Commission had opened it, would be deprived of that guarantee if they did not have the option of challenging before the Court of First Instance the assessment made by the Commission (see, to that effect, Case C-198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I-2487, paragraphs 20 to 24).",prem
"Accordingly, in holding, at paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal, that the fact that the aid at issue was existing aid did not deprive the applicants of an interest in bringing proceedings in that case, on the ground that such aid might not be covered by the decision of 3 July 1991, and, at paragraphs 39 and 40 of that judgment, that the applicants could secure compliance with the procedural guarantees under Article 93(2) of the Treaty only if they were able to challenge the contested decision before the Community Court, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.",prem
"As regards, thirdly, the Commission's claim in the alternative that the Court should set aside the words in their view in paragraph 36 of the English version of the judgment under appeal, it is clear from the grounds of that judgment that the Court of First Instance did not decide on the admissibility of the application on the basis of a subjective appraisal of the interests of the applicants, but, as explained above, on the basis of the rules governing the admissibility of actions under Article 173 of the Treaty.",prem
"Against that background, the Commission's claim, even if it is admissible, is not well founded.",prem
"As regards the admissibility of this plea, the same response must be given to the Commission and DAI as was given at paragraphs 48 to 51 of this judgment to the objection of inadmissibility raised against the main appeal as a whole, that is to say, the objection must be rejected.",prem
"As regards the merits, it is settled case-law that the Commission may approve general aid schemes in the course of the review it must carry out under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and dispense with notification by Member States of individual aid measures taken under such schemes, subject to the reservations it may express in the decision allowing such schemes (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 21, and Case C-278/95 P Siemens v Commission [1997] ECR I-2507, paragraphs 31 to 33).",prem
"The Commission has a wide discretion in this matter (Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 18).",prem
"Second, it is for the Commission, when it approves a general aid scheme, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the sectoral rules other than the general competition rules will be complied with by the Member State concerned.",prem
"In the event, the Commission made the approval under its decision of 3 July 1991 subject to the express condition that the individual aid was in conformity with the rules and guidelines laid down by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors.",prem
It also required the Portuguese Government to notify all projects enjoying reliefs of between 10 and 20% (ESL) and all those in sensitive sectors.,prem
The appellants have not put forward any more arguments than they did at first instance capable of establishing that those instructions were in breach of the rules applicable to the sugar sector or were insufficient to the extent that the decision of 3 July 1991 was vitiated by illegality.,prem
"Moreover, it is common ground that the Commission is not prevented, after the adoption of a decision approving a general aid scheme, from examining the compatibility of an individual aid measure with that decision.",prem
"Such an examination can be carried out at any time under Article 93(1) of the Treaty, particularly in the event of any complaints which the Commission may receive.",prem
"The decision of 3 July 1991 thus does not have the effect of preventing the legitimate interests of third parties from being taken into account and cannot, therefore, be regarded as an illegal restriction of the scope of Article 93(2) and (3) of the Treaty.",prem
"Accordingly, since the conditions laid down by the Commission in the decision of 3 July 1991 were not inadequate and that decision did not prejudice the protection of the legitimate interests of the appellants, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.",prem
"First, the second plea of the appeal sets out clearly the aspects of the judgment under appeal which are challenged and gives an account of the legal arguments in support of it.",prem
"In addition, this claim relates to the infringement of Community law the Court of First Instance is alleged to have committed in holding that the Commission did not have to examine the compatibility of an individual aid measure with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and does not, therefore, constitute a challenge to a finding of fact, which, in an appeal, is outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice.",prem
"Accordingly, this plea is admissible.",prem
"Second, when the Commission has before it a specific grant of aid alleged to have been made in pursuance of a previously authorised scheme, it cannot at the outset examine it directly in relation to the Treaty.",prem
"Prior to the initiation of any procedure, it must first examine whether the aid is covered by the general scheme and satisfies the conditions laid down in the decision approving it.",prem
"If it did not do so, the Commission could, whenever it examined an individual aid measure, go back on its decision approving the aid scheme, which had already involved an examination in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.",prem
"This would jeopardise the principles of the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 24).",prem
"Aid which constitutes the strict and foreseeable application of the conditions laid down in the decision approving the general aid scheme is thus considered to be existing aid (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 25), which does not need to be notified to the Commission or examined in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.",prem
"In the present dispute, as pointed out at paragraph 20 of this judgment, the decision of 3 July 1991, approving the aid scheme set up by Decree-Law No 95/90, made authorisation for tax reliefs subject to two conditions, compliance with which the Commission, in the contested decision, verified before confirming that they had been fulfilled.",prem
"In that regard, the condition relating to the rules applicable in the agricultural sector concerned was not made subject, in the decision of 3 July 1991, to an obligation of prior notification of the planned aid.",prem
"Rather, in that decision, the Commission required those rules to be respected in practice when individual grants of aid were made.",prem
"It is clear from the terms of the contested decision that the Commission took the view that the project for the construction of a beet sugar refinery in Portugal, eligible for Community financing under the EAGGF, was therefore compatible with the objectives of the common agricultural policy.",prem
"It follows from the foregoing that, in holding, at paragraphs 72 to 75 of the judgment under appeal, that the tax reliefs granted to DAI did not need to be notified and that the Commission was not entitled to examine them directly in relation to Article 92 of the Treaty, the Court of First Instance did not err in its application of Community law.",prem
"First, by their third plea, supported by detailed arguments, the appellants set out clearly their challenge to the grounds of the judgment under appeal.",prem
This plea is therefore admissible.,prem
"Second, the tax reliefs granted to DAI must, as the decision of 3 July 1991 provides, comply with the rules of the common agricultural policy in the sugar sector laid down by Regulation No 1785/81.",prem
"Article 44 of that regulation provides that Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty are to apply to the production of, and trade in, sugar.",prem
That article also provides that that general rule is to be applicable save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.,prem
"Article 45 thereof provides that it is to be applied so that appropriate account is taken, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 of the EC Treaty (now Article 33 EC).",prem
"Moreover, as the Court of First Instance pointed out at paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal, Article 24 of that regulation was specifically amended by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic so as to allow to that Member State, on its mainland, the benefit of a production quota of 60 000 tonnes for sugar.",prem
"It is clear from those provisions that, while it does not, per se, authorise the payment of State aid to a project intended to utilise that quota, Regulation No 1785/81 in no way precludes that possibility.",prem
At paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance made the same preliminary finding and thus did not consider that the tax reliefs in favour of DAI could be declared compatible with the common agricultural policy solely because of the allocation of that quota.,prem
"Accordingly, the argument that, unlike the Act of Accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic did not contain a clause providing for the exceptional grant of State aid is, in any event, redundant.",prem
"Article 45 of Regulation No 1785/81 refers to the general objectives of the common agricultural policy set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, which include, in Article 39(2)(a), taking account of the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions.",prem
The rules applicable to investment in the sugar sector are thus not only those established by Regulation No 1785/81.,prem
They also appear in the legislative texts governing the structural and regional policy measures of the Community.,prem
"Those texts make provision for the Community, or the Portuguese Republic, to grant financial support for the investment project at issue.",prem
"First of all, Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, a regulation adopted on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty and thus an integral part of the common agricultural policy, makes provision for Member States to grant, over and above the measures specifically provided for by that regulation, aid for the processing and marketing of agricultural products, under the conditions laid down by Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty.",prem
"Next, the aid granted to DAI meets the criteria for eligibility of investment liable to benefit from financial aid under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF laid down by Decision 94/173.",prem
"That decision provides, at point 2.8 of its annex, that, by way of exception to the rule which excludes investment in the sugar sector, investment for the purpose of the utilisation of the quota provided for in the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic may be given Community financing.",prem
"By the contested decision, the Commission indicated that in the sector of the processing and marketing of agricultural products, State aid must meet the criteria for selection of investments set by Decision 94/173.",prem
"That guideline is the same as that in the Commission communications relating to State aid in that sector such as those of 12 July 1994 and 23 March 1995 and the communication of 2 February 1996, issued after the events which are the subject of this dispute.",prem
"Next, in taking the view that the objectives of the regional and agricultural policy of the Community justified the particular treatment of the investment project at issue, as regards a region covered by Objective No 1, the Commission did not exercise its discretion in a manifestly erroneous way.",prem
Nor did it disregard the terms of the authority conferred on it by Article 8 of Regulation No 866/90 to fix criteria for the eligibility of investments for Community action.,prem
"Finally, it must be pointed out that the fact that the investment made by DAI is specifically taken into account is a result precisely of the special treatment given to the Portuguese Republic by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, as the Court of First Instance observed at paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal.",prem
"Accordingly, the appellants' argument that the contested decision creates an artificial sugar producer and distorts competition by aggravating overproduction on the common market in sugar must be rejected.",prem
"It follows from the foregoing that, in holding that the tax reliefs granted to DAI were not incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.",prem
"While the applicants argued before the Court of First Instance that the Commission had made an error of law in considering in isolation the effects on the common market of the aid for vocational training granted to DAI, it was only in relation to the part of the contested decision relating to that aid.",prem
"They did not thus put forward a general claim for annulment directed at the contested decision as a whole, alleging that the Commission should have assessed the compatibility of the cumulative effect of the three contested measures in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty, as is confirmed by the part of their application entitled General grounds of the action which does not mention that claim.",prem
"Thus, the Court of First Instance, at paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal, pointed to the fact that the three types of aid examined in the contested decision were covered by different sets of legal provisions and had therefore to be examined individually in the light of those rules and the aims which they pursued, only in order to conclude that the compatibility with Article 92 of the Treaty of the aid for vocational training had to be considered separately and that specific plea rejected.",prem
The plea put forward by the appellants in the appeal is thus wider in scope than that put before the Court of First Instance.,prem
"Under Article 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, Article 42(2) of those rules, which prohibits generally the introduction of new pleas in law in the course of the procedure, applies to the procedure before the Court of Justice on appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance.",prem
"In an appeal the Court's jurisdiction is thus confined to review of the findings on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59, and the order of 28 June 2001 in Case C-352/99 P Eridania and Others v Council [2001] ECR I-5037, paragraphs 52 and 53).",prem
"The plea is, therefore, admissible only to the extent that it criticises the error of law allegedly made by the Court of First Instance in holding that aid for vocational training should be considered separately by the Commission.",prem
"As to that, the contested aid measures are covered by different sets of legal provisions.",prem
"As stated at paragraph 86 of this judgment, the tax reliefs could be examined only in the light of the decision of 3 July 1991, which itself refers to the rules of the common agricultural policy, and not directly in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.",prem
"The national co-financing of the investment considered eligible for the Guidance Section of the EAGGF had to be examined in the light of Regulation No 866/90 and Decision 94/173, which determine the balance to be struck between the aims of the common agricultural policy and of the Community's regional policy in the sugar sector.",prem
The aid for vocational training was thus the only measure whose compatibility the Commission could assess directly in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.,prem
"Accordingly, the judgment under appeal is not vitiated by any error of law on this point.",prem
"The fifth plea, like the previous pleas, indicates clearly the contested parts of the judgment and sets out the legal arguments on which it is based.",prem
"It is not therefore the mere repetition of the terms of the action at first instance and must, therefore, be declared admissible.",prem
"Second, as regards the merits of the plea, Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 merely provides that Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty are to apply to the production of, and trade in, sugar save as otherwise provided in this Regulation.",prem
"Moreover, that regulation refers, implicitly but necessarily, to the implementation of provisions other than those contained in it, in indicating, in Article 45, that its application must take account of the general objectives of the common agricultural policy set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, one aspect of which is the alleviation of regional disparities in that area.",prem
Regulation No 866/90 sets out the conditions under which the Guidance Section of the EAGGF helps to further the objectives of regional cohesion of the common agricultural policy.,prem
"It lays down as a ground rule, in Article 16(3) and (4), that Member States concerned by investment projects eligible for the Fund, as the Portuguese Republic is by the project at issue, must, like the beneficiaries of the Fund, undertake to participate in financing the investments selected by the Commission for assistance from the EAGGF.",prem
"Co-financing by the Member States, such as that at issue, is thus not only authorised but required by the regulation.",prem
"Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, which provides that Member States may take aid measures which are subject to conditions or rules concerning granting which differ from those provided for in that regulation, or, where the amounts of aid exceed the ceilings specified herein, on condition that such measures comply with Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty, thus does not concern the national financial contribution required by Article 16(3) and (4) of that regulation but the aid which the Member States wish to give, over and above their obligatory contribution to the investment projects eligible for the Guidance Section of the EAGGF.",prem
"Accordingly, the Court of First Instance did not misapply Community law in holding that the co-financing provided by the Portuguese Republic to the investment project at issue, eligible for the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, had to be assessed in the context of the common action undertaken in accordance with Regulation No 866/90 and could not be the subject of examination under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.",prem
"First, the sixth plea is admissible as it is directed against duly identified grounds of the judgment under appeal and does not merely reproduce the terms of the application to the Court of First Instance.",prem
"Second, it is clear from the argument of the appellants that, in this plea, they submit that, in rejecting their claim that the investment aid in question could not fall within the scope of Regulation No 866/90, the Court of First Instance did not rule on their arguments that the aid did not fulfil the basic conditions laid down by Articles 2 and 11 to 13 of that regulation.",prem
"That part of the judgment is thus, it is alleged, vitiated by a failure to state sufficient reasons.",prem
"However, it must be borne in mind that, in the contested decision, the Commission took the view that the aid in question fell, on first analysis, within the scope of Regulation No 866/90.",prem
"It concluded from this that the aid could not be examined directly in relation to Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and stated that it would analyse subsequently, in the light of Regulation (EEC) No 866/90, the aspect of co-financing of the project under that regulation.",prem
"The Commission thus did not consider whether the project fulfilled the conditions for Community co-financing by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, nor, therefore, whether the national contribution to that project met the basic conditions of the regulation.",prem
"The appellants criticised that appraisal before the Court of First Instance, arguing that the investment project in question did not fall within the scope of Regulation No 866/90 and that, therefore, Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty were applicable in the case.",prem
"They put forward two pleas in support of that complaint: the first was that Decision 94/173, adopted pursuant to Regulation No 866/90, was incompatible with the common agricultural policy and, therefore, illegal, while the second was that the basic conditions laid down by that regulation were not, in the event, met.",prem
"While, in order to reject the claim that Articles 92 and 93 were applicable to the project at issue, the Court of First Instance was obliged to rule, as it did at paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal, on the plea that Decision 94/173 was incompatible with the common agricultural policy, since that decision determined the scope of Regulation No 866/90, it did not have to rule on the arguments in support of the second plea, relating to the fulfilment of the basic conditions of that regulation, which did not affect the legality of the contested decision and were, therefore, inoperative.",prem
"Accordingly, in referring to paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal when rejecting the plea that the aid at issue was not within the scope of Regulation No 866/90, the Court of First Instance did not vitiate the judgment by an insufficient statement of reasons.",prem
The claim that the Court should dismiss the appeal as manifestly inadmissible in its entirety must therefore be rejected.,conc
It follows from the foregoing that the Commission's cross-appeal must be dismissed.,conc
"The first plea must, therefore, be rejected.",conc
"The second plea must, therefore, be rejected.",conc
"Accordingly, the third plea can only be rejected.",conc
"The fourth plea must, therefore, be rejected.",conc
"The fifth plea must, therefore, be rejected.",conc
"The sixth plea must, therefore, be rejected.",conc
