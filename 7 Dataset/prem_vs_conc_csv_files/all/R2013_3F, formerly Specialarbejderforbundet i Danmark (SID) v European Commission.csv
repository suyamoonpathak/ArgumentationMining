"In examining the present plea, it should be noted first of all that Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88] of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1) provides for a stage at which the aid measures notified undergo a preliminary examination, the purpose of which is to enable the Commission to form an initial view as to whether that aid is compatible with the common market.",prem
"On completion of that stage, the Commission is to make a finding either that the measure does not constitute aid or that it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC.",prem
"In the latter case, it may be that the measure does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the common market;",prem
"on the other hand, it is also possible that the measure may raise such doubts (judgment of 24 May 2011 in Case C‑83/09 P Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 43; order of 9 June 2011 in Case C‑451/10 P TF1 v Commission, paragraph 47; judgment of 22 September 2011 in Case C‑148/09 P Belgium v Deutsche Post and DHL International, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 53; and judgment of 27 October 2011 in Case C‑47/10 P Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 40).",prem
"Where the Commission, after the preliminary examination, finds that no doubts are raised as to the compatibility with the common market of a notified measure in so far as it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC, it is to adopt a decision not to raise objections under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 44; TF1 v Commission, paragraph 48; and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraph 41).",prem
"Where the Commission adopts such a decision, it declares not only that the measure is compatible with the common market, but also – by implication – that it refuses to initiate the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 45, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraph 42).",prem
"If, following the preliminary examination, it finds that the measure notified raises doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, the Commission is required to adopt, on the basis of Article 4(4) of Regulation No 659/1999, a decision initiating the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of that regulation (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 46; TF1 v Commission, paragraph 50; and Belgium v Deutsche Post and DHL International, paragraph 77).",prem
"According to settled case-law, the procedure under Article 88(2) EC is essential whenever the Commission has serious difficulties in determining whether aid is compatible with the common market.",prem
"The Commission may therefore restrict itself to the preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC when taking a decision in favour of aid only if it is able to satisfy itself after an initial examination that the aid is compatible with the common market (see Case C‑431/07 P Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission [2009] ECR I‑2665, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraph 70).",prem
"In the present instance, the contested decision is a decision founded on Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/199 not to raise objections.",prem
The legality of that decision therefore depends on whether objectively doubts were raised as to the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market.,prem
"Where an applicant seeks the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, he must prove the existence of doubts as to the aid’s compatibility (Commission v Kronoply and Kronotex, paragraph 59).",prem
"That proof may be furnished by reference to a body of consistent evidence: the question whether or not a doubt exists requires investigation of both the circumstances in which the decision not to raise objections was adopted and its content, comparing the assessments upon which the Commission relied in that decision with the information available to it when it ruled on the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market (see, to that effect, Case C‑198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I‑2487, paragraphs 30 and 31; Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission, paragraph 63; TF1 v Commission, paragraph 52; and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, paragraphs 71 and 72).",prem
"It follows that, while the length of the preliminary examination procedure can constitute an indication that the Commission may have had doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market, its length cannot of itself lead to the conclusion that the Commission should have initiated the formal investigation procedure (see, to that effect, Case 84/82 Germany v Commission [1984] ECR 1451, paragraphs 14 to 17, and Belgium v Deutsche Post and DHL International, paragraph 81).",prem
"By the present plea, 3F complains that the General Court concluded, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the duration of the preliminary examination stage in this case, although it exceeded the time usually required for a preliminary examination, was justified to a large extent by the circumstances and context of the procedure, without having found that those factors represented exceptional circumstances.",prem
"However, notwithstanding what it concluded in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held in paragraph 69 of that judgment that the question in the case in point was, as 3F stated, not whether the duration of the preliminary examination was reasonable but whether there were serious difficulties such as to raise doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid.",prem
"With regard to the latter question, the General Court held, in paragraph 70 of the judgment, that while the length of the preliminary examination did not of itself suffice to show the existence of serious difficulties, it could nevertheless constitute an indication of the existence of such difficulties.",prem
"The General Court stated in this regard, in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal, that it is only if it is reinforced by other factors that the passage of time, even if that time considerably exceeds the time usually required for a preliminary examination under Article 88(3) EC, may lead to the conclusion that the Commission encountered serious difficulties.",prem
"Consequently, the General Court examined, in paragraphs 73 to 89 of the judgment under appeal, whether the other factors relied upon by 3F relating to the circumstances of the preliminary examination procedure were such as to reinforce that indication of serious difficulties, before concluding, in paragraph 94 of the judgment, that ‘it follows from all of the foregoing that [3F] has not shown that the Commission was confronted with serious difficulties’.",prem
"It is therefore apparent that, contrary to what 3F presupposes in the present plea, the General Court did not draw any factual or legal inference from the finding made in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal concerning the duration of the preliminary examination stage being justified in the light of the circumstances and context of the procedure, but, on the contrary, examined whether the indication of the existence of doubts resulting from that stage’s duration, which prima facie was excessive in the present instance, was reinforced by other factors.",prem
"For the reasons already set out in paragraphs 33 to 36 of the present judgment, it is necessary at the outset to reject the first part of the second plea as ineffective in so far as it seeks to contest the finding made by the General Court in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal that the duration of the preliminary examination stage is justified.",prem
"As to the remainder, in so far as 3F seeks, by the first part of the second plea, to complain that the General Court examined the duration of the preliminary examination stage in isolation from the other circumstances of the contested decision’s adoption and from the content of the contested decision, it need merely be stated that, as already follows from paragraph 35 of the present judgment, 3F’s line of argument is founded on an incorrect reading of the judgment under appeal.",prem
"It is clear from paragraphs 70 to 89 of that judgment that it was only after determining whether the indication of the existence of doubts resulting from the duration of the preliminary examination was reinforced by other factors relating to the circumstances that had surrounded the adoption of the contested decision that the General Court concluded, in paragraph 94 of the judgment, that 3F had not shown that the Commission was confronted with serious difficulties.",prem
"Furthermore, having failed to advance before the General Court any argument relating to the content of the contested decision, 3F cannot complain that the General Court did not take that matter into account, since, as noted in paragraph 30 of the present judgment, it is for the applicant to prove the existence of serious difficulties such as to raise doubts.",prem
"Consequently, the first part of the second plea must be rejected as partly ineffective and partly unfounded.",prem
The second part of this plea must be rejected as inadmissible in so far as 3F complains that the General Court examined separately each of the specific arguments advanced by it concerning the aforesaid circumstances.,prem
"3F merely contends that the General Court should have carried out an overall assessment of those matters and does not set out in the slightest in what respect – inasmuch as it found, in its definitive assessment of the facts in paragraphs 73 to 89 of the judgment under appeal, that, in the circumstances of the present case, none of those matters taken individually enabled the existence of doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question to be established – the General Court is alleged to have erred in law by not carrying out an overall assessment of that kind.",prem
"However, according to settled case-law, it follows from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Articles 168(1)(d) and 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and also the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal (see, in particular, Case C‑352/98 P Bergaderm and Goupil v Commission [2000] ECR I‑5291, paragraph 34, and Case C‑240/03 P Comunità montana della Valnerina v Commission [2006] ECR I‑731, paragraph 105 and the case-law cited).",prem
"This requirement is not satisfied by a plea which complains that the General Court reached a certain conclusion without specifying the legal basis on which it ought to have reached a different one (Case C‑257/98 P Lucaccioni v Commission [1999] ECR I‑5251, paragraph 62, and order of 26 January 2005 in Case C‑153/04 P Euroagri v Commission, paragraph 38).",prem
"In so far as, by the second part of the second plea, 3F complains that the General Court did not give the duration of the preliminary examination stage a weight proportionate to its length, it must be acknowledged that the period of more than four years in the present instance between the lodging of 3F’s complaint and the Commission’s decision of approval significantly exceeds the time usually required for an initial examination at the preliminary examination stage.",prem
"However, the fact remains that, in the present instance, the General Court held, in its definitive assessment of the facts, that the other factors advanced by 3F concerning the circumstances of the contested decision’s adoption were not such as to reinforce the indication of the existence of doubts which could result from the – prima facie excessive – duration of that stage.",prem
It should also be noted that in its action before the General Court 3F did not derive any argument from the content of the contested decision.,prem
"As pointed out in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, the duration of the preliminary examination stage, contrary to what 3F suggests in this part of the second plea, cannot, whatever its length, demonstrate of itself the existence of doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market.",prem
"In those circumstances, even if greater weight were required to be accorded to the duration of the preliminary examination stage where, as in the present case, it significantly exceeds the period normally required for a preliminary examination, the General Court did not err in law by not giving such weight to that matter.",prem
"Therefore, the second part of the second plea must be rejected as partly inadmissible and partly unfounded.",prem
"According to settled case-law, the obligation to state reasons owed by the General Court under Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, which applies to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute, and Article 81 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court requires it to disclose clearly and unequivocally the reasoning followed by it, in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the decision taken and the Court of Justice to exercise its power of review (see, inter alia, Case C‑280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission [2010] ECR I‑9555, paragraphs 135 and 136 and the case-law cited).",prem
"However, the requirement that the General Court give reasons for its decisions cannot be interpreted as meaning that it is obliged to respond in detail to every single argument advanced by the applicant, particularly if the argument was not sufficiently clear and precise (see, inter alia, Joined Cases C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission [2008] ECR I‑6513, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).",prem
"In this connection, it is to be recalled that it follows from the first paragraph of Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice read in conjunction with Article 44(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court that the application initiating proceedings must contain, inter alia, a summary of the pleas in law on which it is based.",prem
"In the present instance, it is apparent from 3F’s pleadings before the General Court that the line of argument put forward by it at first instance concerning infringement of the principle of good administration was not supported at all by separate considerations, but was linked exclusively to the line of argument concerning the alleged infringement of Article 88(2) EC.",prem
"Thus, although, in the application initiating proceedings, the title of the first plea mentions the principle of good administration, paragraph 42 of the application, which concludes the line of argument concerning that plea, merely states that, ‘by failing to open the Article 88(2) [EC] procedure the Commission infringed that [provision] as applied by the case-law and the principle of good administration’, without explaining precisely in what respect the failure to open the formal investigation procedure constitutes an infringement of that principle.",prem
"Likewise, in paragraph 15 of its reply before the General Court, 3F merely states, in respect of that principle, that the issue is whether, ‘having regard to the complexity of the issues, the time spent on these issues and the fact as the Commission now reveals other cases involved the same “important question of principle”, the Commission should have opened a formal investigation in which all Member States and interested parties could submit comments’.",prem
"Furthermore, as is apparent from paragraph 69 of the judgment under appeal, in the same paragraph of the reply 3F itself stated that the question as to whether the duration of the preliminary examination was reasonable was not raised in the present case.",prem
"Accordingly, since 3F did not set out in its action before the General Court any specific line of argument concerning infringement of the principle of good administration that was separate from the line of argument relating to infringement of Article 88(2) EC, the General Court cannot be reproached for having dismissed the plea alleging infringement of the principle of good administration without stating specific reasons in the judgment under appeal in that regard.",prem
"Also, in so far as, by its arguments set out in the alternative, 3F now seeks to put forward separate and specific grounds to demonstrate that the Commission infringed the principle of good administration, essentially alleging that the duration of the preliminary examination stage was unreasonable, it is to be recalled that, according to Article 170(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court may not be changed in the appeal.",prem
The Court of Justice’s jurisdiction in an appeal is confined to a review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the General Court.,prem
"A party may not, therefore, put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea which it could have raised before the General Court but has not raised, since to do so would be to allow it to bring before the Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the General Court (see judgment of 29 September 2011 in Case C‑520/09 P Arkema v Commission, not yet published in the ECR, paragraph 64 and the case-law cited).",prem
"As to the remainder, in so far as, by these arguments advanced in the alternative, 3F alleges that the Commission infringed the principle of good administration because the formal investigation procedure was not initiated, suffice it to state that 3F merely repeats, without identifying the passages of the judgment under appeal that are supposedly wrong in law, the arguments put forward before the General Court.",prem
"According to settled case-law, an appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by that Court, does not satisfy the requirements to state reasons under the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Articles 168(1)(d) and 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, requirements which are recalled in paragraph 51 of the present judgment.",prem
"Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to undertake (see, inter alia, Bergaderm and Goupil v Commission, paragraph 35, and Comunità montana della Valnerina v Commission, paragraph 106 and the case-law cited).",prem
"Consequently, the first plea must be dismissed as ineffective.",conc
"Consequently, the second plea must be dismissed.",conc
"Consequently, the third plea must be dismissed as partly inadmissible and partly unfounded.",conc
