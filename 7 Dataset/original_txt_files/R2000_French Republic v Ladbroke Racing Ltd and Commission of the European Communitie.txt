JUDGMENT OF 16. J. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
gives the following 
Judgment 
1 
By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of Justice on 26 March 1998, 
the French Republic brought an appeal pursuant to Article 49 of the EC Statute 
of the Court of Justice against the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
27 January 1998 in Case T-67/94 Ladbroke Racing v Commission [1998] ECR 
II-l ('the judgment under appeal'), by which the Court of First Instance had 
annulled in part Commission Decision 93/625/EEC of 22 September 1993 
concerning aid granted by the French authorities to the Pari Mutuel Urbain 
(PMU) and to the racecourse undertakings (OJ 1993 L 300, p. 15; 'the contested 
decision'). 
Facts and procedure before the Court of First Instance 
2 
In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance made the following 
findings of fact: 
'1 The applicant, Ladbroke Racing Ltd (hereinafter "Ladbroke"), is a company 
incorporated under English law and controlled by Ladbroke Group pic 
whose activities include organising and providing betting services in 
connection with horse-races in the United Kingdom and other countries in 
the European Community.

The Pari Mutuel Urbain ("the PMU") is an economic interest group 
(groupement d'intérêt économique) consisting of the principal racecourse

FRANCE V LADliROKU RACING AND COMMISSION 
undertakings (sociétés de courses) in France (Article 21 of Decree 83-878 of 
4 October 1983 concerning racecourse undertakings and totalisator betting), 
which was set up to manage the organisation of off-course totalisator betting 
on behalf of its members. In discharging that responsibility, the PMU's status 
was initially that of a "joint administrative department" (decree of 11 July 
1930 extending totalisator betting to off-course operations). Article 13 of 
Decree 74-954 of 14 November 1974 concerning the racecourse under-
takings provides that as from that date the PMU alone may manage the 
organisation of off-course totalisator betting by the racecourse undertakings. 
The PMU's exclusive position is further safeguarded by the preclusion of 
persons other than the PMU from offering to receive or receiving bets on 
horse-races (Article 8 of the Interministerial Order of 13 September 1985 
laying down rules for the PMU). It covers the taking of bets on races in 
France and bets in France on races abroad, services which likewise can be 
offered only by the racecourse undertakings which are authorised to do so 
and/or the PMU (Article 15(3) of Law 64-1279 of 23 December 1964 laying 
down the Finance Law for 1965, and Article 21 of Decree 83-878, cited 
above). 
3 
On 7 April 1989 seven companies belonging to the Ladbroke Group, 
including the applicant, submitted a complaint to the Commission in respect 
of several forms of aid which the French authorities had granted to the PMU 
and which those companies maintained were incompatible with the common 
market. 
5 
By letter of 11 January 1991, the Commission informed the French 
authorities of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 93(2) 
of the EEC Treaty in respect of the following seven categories of aid granted 
to the PMU (OJ 1991 C 38, p. 3): 
"1. cash-flow benefits represented by the deferring of the periods for the 
payment of the Treasury levy, as from 1980 and 1981; 
I-3311 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
2. waiving of [FRF] 180 million of the levies for 1986; 
3. exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT; 
4. use of unclaimed winnings to pay an additional redundancy allowance in 
1985; 
5. exemption from the housing levy; 
6. waiving from 1982 to 1985 of amounts deriving from the practice of 
rounding bettors' winnings down to the nearest ten centimes; 
7. exemption from corporation tax." 
13 On 22 September 1993 the Commission adopted [the contested decision], 
terminating the procedure initiated against France. 
I-3312 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
16 In the contested decision, the Commission drew a distinction between two 
types of sums collected on horse-race betting, namely "levies" or "public 
levies" ("prélèvements publics"), which go to the Treasury, and "non-public 
levies", which are distributed between bettors. According to the contested 
decision, for every [FRF] 100 in registered bets, the PMU levies about 
[FRF] 30 and pays back about [FRF] 70 to the bettors. Of the [FRF] 30 
withheld, the PMU uses about [FRF] 5.5 to cover its expenses, the national 
authorities and the City of Paris retain about [FRF] 18, and the rest is 
allocated to the racecourse undertakings. 
17 The Commission went on to point out that whereas the markets in games of 
chance have traditionally been partitioned along national lines, betting on 
horse-races on national courses is organised internationally, and it was not 
until January 1989, when the Pari Mutuel International ("the PMI") was set 
up, that the PMU expressly made clear its desire to extend its activities 
beyond France by concluding agreements in Germany and Belgium, and by 
thereby entering into competition with other betting organisations and 
particularly with Ladbroke (part III of the contested decision). 
18 Of the seven measures adopted by the French Government in favour of the 
PMU with regard to which the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty 
was initiated, three were identified by the Commission as State aid within the 
meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty. 
19 The Commission considered that the waiver between 1982 and 1985 of part 
of the levy ([FRF] 315 million) on the amount deriving from the practice of 
rounding down bettors' winnings to the nearest ten centimes — allocated to 
the Treasury since 1967, pursuant to the Finance Law of 17 Decem-
ber 1966 — constituted aid since it was a "measure limited in time and 
intended to solve a specific problem", namely computerisation of the PMU's 
I - 3313 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
operations in order to assist it in strengthening its market position (parts IV 
and V, point 2). 
20 It also regarded the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the 
deduction of VAT as a cash-flow benefit equivalent to State aid; however, the 
Commission found that this had been offset between 1989 and its abolition 
on 1 July 1993 by a permanent deposit lodged with the French Treasury 
(parts IV and V, point 6). 
21 Lastly, as regards the PMU's exemption from the social housing levy, the 
Commission considered that, even though the Conseil d'État held in a 1962 
judgment that horse-racing was an agricultural activity and therefore exempt 
from such contributions, the PMU's activity — organising and processing 
bets — fell manifestly outside the scope of agricultural activities. Accord-
ingly, since the exemption at issue was not justified under the PMU's articles 
of association, it constituted State aid (parts IV and V, point 7). 
22 However, the Commission considered that the three forms of aid in question 
qualified for exemption under Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty. 
23 As regards the aid resulting from the waiver of the amounts deriving from the 
practice of rounding down winnings to the nearest ten centimes, the 
Commission took the view that, although the intensity of that aid was high 
(almost 29% of the total cost of computerisation), "given the state of 
development of competition and trade before the setting-up of the PMI in 
January 1989, the aid granted between 1982 and 1985 for the computerisa-
tion of the PMU did not produce any disruptive effects on the market 
contrary to the common interest, bearing in mind the direct and indirect 
effects of the aid in developing all the economic factors making up the sector, 
including the improvement of bloodstock" (part VII, point 1). 
I-3314 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
24 In the case of the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction 
of VAT, the Commission took the view that — for the same reasons as were 
cited in connection with the aid just referred to — it had likewise to be 
regarded as compatible with the common market up to January 1989. 
Thereafter, any adverse effects of that aid on competition were offset in full 
by a permanent deposit lodged with the Treasury (part VII, point 2). 
25 As for the aid attributable to the exemption from the housing levy, the 
Commission considered that, like the aid resulting from the exemption from 
the one-month delay rule for deduction of VAT, it qualified up to 1989 for the 
derogation provided for in Article 92(3)(c); thereafter, however, it had to be 
declared incompatible (part VII, point 3). 
26 However, with regard to the obligation to repay the aid obtained in that form 
as of 1989, the Commission stated that "... repayment as from that date 
should not be required in view of the French authorities' argument that the 
contribution could not be levied because of the 1962 decision of the Conseil 
d'État referred to in part IV, point 7" (see above, paragraph 21); none the 
less, "[that] argument cannot be accepted as from the time when the 
initiation of proceedings was notified to the French authorities, namely on 
11 January 1991". The Commission also stated that it had not been given the 
means to quantify for itself the amount of aid to be recovered and requested 
the French authorities to determine themselves and communicate to the 
Commission such amount (part VIII). 
27 In the case of the other four measures, the Commission decided that the 
conditions laid down for the application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty were 
not satisfied. 
I - 3315 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-S3/98 P 
28 As regards the amounts resulting from unclaimed winnings, the Commission 
considered that, in so far as those amounts have always been regarded as 
normal resources, they form part of the non-public levies. Their use to 
finance in particular social security expenditure together with monitoring 
and supervision costs, horse-breeding incentives and investment connected 
with the organisation of horse-racing and totalisator betting cannot therefore 
be regarded as State aid, since the State resources criterion is not met (parts 
IV and V, point 1). 
29 As regards the change in the allocation of the public levies (see above, 
paragraph 16), the Commission stated that the tax arrangements applicable 
to horse-races are the responsibility of the Member States and increases or 
reductions in the rate of tax do not constitute State aid provided that they 
apply uniformly to all the undertakings concerned. The question of State aid 
arises only where a significant reduction in the rate of taxation strengthens 
the financial situation of an undertaking in a monopoly position. That was 
not the case here, however, in so far as the 1984 reduction in the public levy 
on bets was limited (some 1.6%) and subsequently maintained, and was thus 
not designed to finance a specific ad hoc operation. The French authorities 
acted with the aim of increasing the resources of the recipients of the non-
public levies on a permanent basis. Taking account of the special nature of 
the recipients' situation, the measure in question did not constitute State aid, 
but a "reform in the form of a 'tax' adjustment that is justified by the nature 
and economy of the system in question" (parts IV and V, point 3). 
30 As regards the PMU's exemption from corporation tax, the Commission took 
the view that, in so far as corporation tax "cannot apply to the [economic 
interest group] PMU since its legal form is that of an economic interest 
grouping", the exemption must "be considered to stem from the normal 
application of the general tax system" (part V, point 4). 
I-3316 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
31 Regarding the cash-flow benefit— amounting to nearly two months' 
additional resources — deriving from the deferral allowed in the payment 
of the public levies, which was granted to the PMU by decisions of the 
Minister for the Budget of 24 April 1980 and 19 February 1982, the 
Commission considered that in so far as that advantage had had the effect of 
increasing the share of the non-public levies continuously since 1981, it did 
not involve "a temporary waiving of resources by the public authorities or a 
specific ad boc measure", and accordingly fell to be assessed in the same way 
as the change in the allocation of the levies (see above, paragraph 29) (parts 
IV and V, point 5).' 
3 
It was in those circumstances that Ladbroke brought an application before the 
Court of First Instance for annulment of the contested decision in so far as the 
Commission had decided therein: 
(1) that the following measures fell outside the scope of Article 92(1) of the EC 
Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87(1) EC): 
(a) cash-flow benefits allowing the PMU to defer the payment of certain 
betting levies to the State; 
(b) exemption from corporation tax; 
(c) exemption from income tax; 
(d) waiver of FRF 180 million of betting levies in 1986; 
I - 3317 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
(e) the PMU's entitlement to retain unclaimed winnings; 
(f) exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT from 
I January 1989 onwards; 
(2) that the following measures were compatible with the common market 
pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty: 
(a) the rounding down of bettors' winnings to the nearest 10 centimes 
between 1982 and 1985, representing FRF 315 million; 
(b) the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT 
prior to 1 January 1989; 
(c) the exemption from the housing levy prior to 1 January 1989; 
(3) (a) that there should be no repayment of aid granted to the PMU in the form 
of exemption from the housing levy in respect of the period prior to 
II January 1991; 
(b) that the Commission had no obligation to determine itself the amount of 
the aid in respect of the exemption from the housing levy that it ordered 
to be repaid from 11 January 1991. 
I-3318 


FRANCU V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
The judgment under appeal 
4 
In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that in the case of 
decisions as to whether a measure is to be characterised as State aid, which, under 
the Treaty, are the responsibility of both the Commission and the national courts, 
there is in principle no reason to attribute a broad discretion to the Commission 
in the absence of special circumstances arising from the complex nature of the 
State intervention in question. It also pointed out that, while both tax legislation 
and the implementation of tax arrangements are matters for the national 
authorities, the exercise of that competence may nevertheless, in certain cases, 
prove to be incompatible with Article 92(1) of the Treaty (paragraphs 51 to 54). 
5 
In the light of those considerations, the Court of First Instance first examined the 
three criteria used by the Commission to determine whether the change in the 
allocation of levies in 1985 and 1986 fell within the scope of Article 92(1) of the 
Treaty (paragraphs 55 to 66). According to the contested decision, the measure in 
question (a) was merely a limited reduction in the rate of the levy (approximately 
1.6%) and did not strengthen the financial situation of a monopoly undertaking, 
(b) was ongoing in character and (c) was not aimed at financing an ad hoc 
operation but at 'increasing the resources of the recipients of the non-public 
levies' (see paragraph 51). 
6 
The Court held that the three criteria, as applied in this instance, were not such as 
to justify the finding by the Commission that the reduction in the levy rate was 
not State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty but should be classed 
I-3319 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
as a reform in the form of a tax adjustment that was justified by the nature and 
scheme of the system in question (paragraph 62). 
7 
Second, with regard to the cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer 
payment of certain betting levies, the Court of First Instance found that the mere 
fact that the measure in question belonged to a separate system intended to apply 
solely to the sector concerned, and did not fall within the derogations from the 
general fiscal arrangements, did not remove it from the ambit of Article 92(1) of 
the Treaty (paragraphs 74 to 77). 
8 
The Court declared that any State measure, whether permanent or temporary, 
which has the effect of granting financial advantages to an undertaking and 
improving its financial position falls within the definition of State aid for the 
purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and, accordingly, the question whether a 
change in the rules for allocation of the levies is temporary or permanent is not an 
adequate test for determining whether that provision applies in a particular case 
(paragraph 78). 
9 
As for the fact that the change in the rules concerning payment to the Treasury of 
the public levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a general 
amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector, the Court 
observed that, contrary to the Commission's assertion, there was no statement to 
that effect in the contested decision, according to which the Minister for the 
Budget had allowed the payments due to the Treasury to be deferred solely in the 
case of the PMU. The fact that, as a general rule, the operation of the pari mutuel 
in France could benefit not only members of the PMU but also, indirectly, non-
member companies, could not be regarded as decisive (paragraph 79). 
I - 3320 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
10 With respect to the Commission's argument that the State intervention in 
question was made in the context of the exceptionally heavy taxation of the 
horse-racing sector, which was considerably higher than in other sectors, the 
Court found that that argument, put forward for the first time before it and 
unsupported by adequate evidence, was not sufficient in itself to show that the 
Commission's view was well founded (paragraph 81). 
1 1 Third, with regard to the PMU's access to unclaimed winnings, the Court of First-
Instance held that resources of that kind could not be regarded as 'normal 
resources' belonging to the racecourse undertakings and the PMU, but-
constituted 'State resources', the allocation of which to the Treasury depended 
on whether certain statutory conditions were met (paragraphs 105 to 108). The 
same conclusion could be inferred from the decision of the French legislature to 
extend the range of uses to which unclaimed winnings could be put to certain 
activities of a social nature carried on by the racecourse undertakings (paragraphs 
109 and 110). 
1 2 Consequently, the Commission's finding that although the measure in question 
was designed to finance social expenditure of the racecourse undertakings linked 
to the organisation of totalisator betting it did not constitute State aid because no 
transfer of State resources was involved was based on false premisses (paragraph 
111). 
1 3 Fourth, so far as concerns the exemption from the one-month delay rule for VAT 
deductions as from 1 January 1989, the Court of First Instance found that it was 
clear from the file that, as conceded by the Commission at the hearing, the 
permanent deposit with the French Treasury which the racecourse undertakings 
had been required to lodge in return for the exemption granted to them on 
1 August 1969 had existed not since 1989 but since 1969, and that the contested 
decision was therefore vitiated on that point by a manifest error (paragraphs 118 
and 119). 
I - 3321 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
14 In the absence of a detailed examination by the Commission of the question 
whether, before 1989, the permanent deposit had offset the cash-flow benefits 
resulting from the alteration to the time for the deduction of VAT, the Court 
considered that it could not rule as to whether State aid was involved. Since the 
Commission's assessment of the measure in question was in any event vitiated by 
error, the Court held that the applicant's claims had to be upheld and that the 
contested decision had to be annulled in that regard (paragraphs 120, 121 and 
122). 
15 Finally, with regard to the obligation to recover aid incompatible with the 
common market, the Court of First Instance considered whether the Commission, 
when it adopts a decision instructing the Member State concerned to recover such 
aid, may restrict the effects in time of that decision on the ground that the 
Member State considers that a judgment delivered by a domestic court was liable 
to give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the recipient of the aid that 
the latter was lawful (paragraph 180). 
16 After reviewing the relevant case-law, the Court held that it is not for the Member 
State concerned, but for the recipient undertaking, in the context of proceedings 
before the public authorities or before the national courts, to plead exceptional 
circumstances on the basis of which it had entertained legitimate expectations, 
justifying refusal to repay unlawful aid (paragraphs 179 to 184). Accordingly, in 
so far as the contested decision limited the temporal scope of the French 
authorities' obligation to require repayment of aid not to the period commencing 
in 1989 (the date from which it was declared incompatible), but to the period 
commencing with the opening of the procedure on 11 January 1991, it was 
vitiated by infringement of Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty (now Article 88(2) EC) 
(paragraph 185). 
I - 3322 


FRANCE V LADBR0KE RACING AND COMMISSION 
17 The Court of First Instance consequently annulled the contested decision in so far 
as it had found: 
— first, that various advantages granted to the PMU, through 
(a) the amendment in 1985 and 1986 of the allocation of the levies, 
(b) cash-flow benefits granted to it by the authorisation to defer payment of 
certain levies on betting, 
(c) access to unclaimed winnings, and 
(d) exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of value 
added tax, after 1 January 1989, 
did not constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty; 
— second, that the obligation on the French authorities to require repayment of 
the aid deriving from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy applied not 
as from 1989, but as from 11 January 1991. 
I - 3323 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
18 The remainder of the action was dismissed and each party was ordered to bear its 
own costs. 
The appeal 
19 The French Republic relies on two grounds of appeal, which are founded on 
errors of law allegedly made by the Court of First Instance in the application of 
Articles 92(1) and (2) and 93(2) of the Treaty. 
First ground of appeal 
20 
By its first ground of appeal, which is in four parts, the appellant challenges the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance in so far as it found that the contested 
decision was defective in that it excluded from the scope of Article 92(1) of the 
Treaty the measures relating to (i) the amendment in 1985 and 1986 of the 
allocation of betting levies, (ii) the cash-flow benefits granted to the PMU as a 
result of the authorisation to defer payment of certain of those levies, (iii) the 
PMU's access to winnings unclaimed by bettors and (iv) the exemption from the 
one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT in respect of the period after 
1 January 1989. 
2 1 In the first part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the 
Court of First Instance made several errors of law in holding that the three criteria 
relied on by the Commission in declining to categorise the measure concerning 
the reduction in the public levies for the benefit of the PMU as State aid were not 
an appropriate basis for ruling out the existence of aid for the purposes of 
Article 92(1) of the Treaty. 
I - 3324 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
22 The appellant maintains, first of all, that in reaching that conclusion the Court of 
First Instance gave insufficient grounds, contrary to Article 190 of the EC Treaty 
(now Article 253 EC), for certain steps in its reasoning, that it failed to adopt a 
position with regard to certain crucial factors relied on both by the Commission, 
in the contested decision and in its pleadings before the Court of First Instance, 
and by the appellant itself, in its statement in intervention, and that it based part 
of its reasoning on false premisses. 
23 It should be noted at the outset that the appellant's argument relates to the nature 
and scope of review of the Commission's assessment as to whether a measure 
adopted by national authorities is to be categorised as State aid. 
24 
According to the appellant, the particular nature of the review of State aid means 
that, when the court carrying out the review is called on to assess the facts of the 
case in the light of legal criteria, it must limit itself to satisfying itself that there is 
no manifest error of assessment. That form of review cannot be reserved for 
special circumstances, whose existence is in any event often difficult to ascertain. 
Consequently, the Court of First Instance erred in law in its definition of the 
nature of the review which it was to carry out in that it stated, in essence, that in 
the absence of special circumstances, arising in particular from the complex 
nature of the State intervention in question, review by it is not to be confined to 
determining whether there has been a manifest error of assessment as to whether 
aid is involved. 
25 
The short answer to that is that State aid, as defined in the Treaty, is a legal 
concept which must be interpreted on the basis of objective factors. For that 
reason, the Community courts must in principle, having regard both to the 
specific features of the case before them and to the technical or complex nature of 
the Commission's assessments, carry out a comprehensive review as to whether a 
measure falls within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty. The Court of First 
I - 3325 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
Instance therefore did not err in law so far as concerns the scope of judicial review 
of the Commission's assessments. 
26 
Second, the appellant alleges that, in its review of the present case, the Court of 
First Instance incorrectly assessed the arguments relied on by the Commission 
when finding that the measure reducing the public levies was not caught by 
Article 92(1). The appellant maintains that the Court of First Instance wrongly 
failed to verify whether the criteria adopted by the Commission were justified, as 
stated in the contested decision, by the nature and scheme of the particular system 
at issue, whose existence the Court of First Instance indeed acknowledged. It 
accordingly erred in law, decisively affecting the outcome of the case. 
27 
The appellant argues that, in the context of regimes applicable to the economy as 
a whole, consideration of the compatibility of particular measures with 
Article 92(1) of the Treaty by reason of the nature and scheme of the system of 
which they form part is essential where the issue is one of distinguishing 
mechanisms which may constitute State aid from others which are not caught by 
Article 92(1) precisely because they are justified by the nature and scheme of the 
system. The Court of First Instance could therefore not avoid consideration of 
whether there was such a justification here before categorising the measure at 
issue as aid. 
28 
As to that, it is clear from paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the 
Court of First Instance not only was aware of the specific nature of the tax regime 
applicable to horse-race betting in France but also took account of it. 
I - 3326 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
29 
Furthermore, the appellant's reasoning is founded on an incorrect analysis of the 
contested decision. As the Advocate General states in points 25 and 26 of his 
Opinion, the Commission did not rely, a priori and in vague terms, on the 
particular nature of the French system of fiscal levies on horse-race betting in 
order to decide that the reduction in the public levies was not State aid. On the 
contrary, it applied three criteria of interpretation from which it derived the three 
propositions set out in paragraph 5 of this judgment, in order to reach the 
conclusion that that reduction amounted not to State aid but to 'a reform in the 
form of a "tax" adjustment that is justified by the nature and economy of the 
system in question'. There is thus no substance to the proposition that the 
criterion relating to the nature and scheme of the system is independent of the 
other three criteria or constitutes the legal basis of the Commission's assessment. 
30 
It follows that the Court of First Instance neither misconstrued nor refused to 
take account of the criterion of the nature and scheme of the system when it 
considered whether, having regard to the facts of the case, the Commission was 
entitled to find that the measure reducing the public levies did not fall within the 
scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty. 
31 Third, the French Government alleges that the Court of First Instance erred with 
regard to the legal characterisation of the facts by implicitly holding that the 
Commission could not infer from the fact that a specific operation was not 
financed and from the limited change in the public levies that the reduction in the 
rate of levy of 1.6% for the benefit of the PMU was consistent with the nature 
and scheme of the system and did not amount to aid within the meaning of 
Article 92(1). 
32 It should be noted that in paragraphs 57, 58 and 59 of the judgment under appeal 
the Court of First Instance queried the validity of those two criteria adopted by 
the Commission, but it found in any event that the change in the rate of the public 
I - 3327 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
levies was designed to finance a specific operation and that the reduction in the 
rate of levy was not limited in nature. 
33 
In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for the Court to establish whether the 
Court of First Instance was wrong to find that the Commission was not entitled 
to have recourse to those criteria in order to determine whether the fiscal measure 
at issue constituted State aid. 
34 
In addition, the arguments relied on by the appellant to contest the findings of the 
Court of First Instance referred to in paragraph 32 of this judgment effectively 
dispute the Court's assessment of the facts, a matter not open to challenge on 
appeal. Those arguments must therefore be rejected as inadmissible. 
35 
The final argument in the first part of the first ground of appeal consists in the 
assertion that a contradiction is apparent in the grounds of the judgment under 
appeal. The appellant refers in particular to paragraph 154 of the judgment, 
where the Court of First Instance stated that 'it is apparent from the contested 
decision that before the PMI was set up in January 1989 there was no trade 
between France and the other Member States, which means that before that date 
there was not even competition between the PMU and the other economic 
operators active on the Community market in bet-taking'. 
38 According to the appellant, on the very wording of Article 92(1) of the Treaty 
that statement should have led the Court of First Instance to find that no measure 
implemented for the benefit of the PMU before 1989, nor in particular 
adjustments to the public levies as from 1985 — at least so far as concerns 
their effects until the end of 1988 — could constitute State aid caught by that 
provision. 
37 That proposition cannot be accepted. It is apparent from paragraphs 51 to 62 of 
the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance merely determined 
whether the three criteria referred to in the contested decision concerning the 
I - 3328 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
change in the public levies were sufficient to justify the finding that that change 
amounted to a reform in the form of a tax adjustment that was justified by the 
nature and scheme of the system in question. On the other hand, the Court of 
First Instance did not rule on the remaining criteria for application of 
Article 92(1) of the Treaty, in particular on the question whether competition 
in the Community betting market was affected by that adjustment of the public 
levies. There can thus be no contradiction between the conclusion set out in 
paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal and the statements contained in 
paragraph 154 thereof. 
38 
The same considerations hold good for the other State measures examined by the 
Court of First Instance. 
39 
The first part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected. 
40 
In the second part of the first ground of appeal, the French Republic criticises the 
judgment under appeal in so far as the Court of First Instance held that the 
Commission had misapplied Article 92(1) of the Treaty when it found that the 
cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer the payment of certain betting 
levies did not constitute State aid. 
41 It should be noted at the outset that the appellant repeats in part the objections 
raised in the first part of this ground of appeal, relating to the scope of judicial 
review and the alleged failure of the Court of First Instance to take account of the 
particular nature of the system of levies on horse-race betting in France and the 
way in which it is organised. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 23 to 30 of this 
judgment, those objections must be rejected. 
I - 3329 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
42 
Next, the appellant criticises the Court of First Instance for finding, in 
paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision contains 
no statement to the effect that the change in the rules concerning payment to the 
Treasury of the betting levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a 
general amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector and not 
only for the PMU. 
43 
Finally, the appellant alleges that, contrary to the statement made by the Court of 
First Instance in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission did 
indeed set out in the contested decision evidence showing that the State 
intervention in question was made in the context of exceptionally heavy taxation 
of the horse-racing sector, which is significantly higher than in other sectors. 
44 
In that regard, suffice it to state, as the Advocate General has done in points 37 
and 39 of his Opinion, that those arguments relate to the Court of First Instance's 
assessment of the facts, which cannot be challenged before the Court of Justice on 
appeal. Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be 
rejected. 
45 
In the third part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the 
Court of First Instance erred in law by holding, in paragraph 111 of the judgment 
under appeal, that the Commission's finding that the PMU's access to winnings 
unclaimed by bettors, while designed to finance social expenditure of the 
racecourse undertakings, did not constitute State aid because no transfer of State 
resources was involved was based on false premisses and for that reason had to be 
annulled. 
I - 3330 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
46 
According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal should be set aside in that 
respect since, having regard to the nature and scheme of the system in question, 
the funds retained by the PMU after payment of winnings to bettors and of the 
public levies constitute normal resources. The mere fact that at a given moment 
the State restricts use of part of those resources to particular objectives cannot 
transform their nature and convert them into State resources. 
47 
In that regard, it is to be noted that in paragraphs 105 to 108 of the judgment 
under appeal the Court of First Instance explains its assessment concerning the 
categorisation of the national measure in question as State aid. As the Advocate 
General states in point 42 of his Opinion, that assessment leaves no room for 
criticism of its legal correctness. 
48 
It is clear from those paragraphs of the judgment under appeal that the measure 
enables the racecourse undertakings to cover certain social expenditure of the 
PMU and that the amount of the sums corresponding to the unclaimed winnings 
is monitored by the competent French authorities. The Court of First Instance 
inferred therefrom in paragraph 109 that, inasmuch as national legislation 
extended the range of uses to which those sums may be put to activities of the 
racecourse undertakings other than those initially envisaged, the national 
legislature, by virtue of that extension, in effect waived revenue which in 
principle should have been paid over to the Treasury. 
49 
The Court of First Instance added in paragraph 110 that in so far as those 
resources had been used 'to finance social expenditure, in particular', as stated in 
the contested decision, it was settled case-law that they constituted a reduction in 
the social security commitments which an undertaking normally had to 
discharge, and thus constituted aid to it. 
I-3331 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
50 The judgment in Case T-358/94 Air France v Commission 
[1996] ECR 11-2109, 
relied on by the appellant, provides very clear confirmation, at paragraph 67, that 
Article 92(1) of the Treaty covers all the financial means by which the public 
sector may actually support undertakings, irrespective of whether or not those 
means are permanent assets of the public sector. Consequently, even though the 
sums involved in the measure allowing the PMU access to unclaimed winnings are 
not permanently held by the Treasury, the fact that they constantly remain under 
public control, and therefore available to the competent national authorities, is 
sufficient for them to be categorised as State aid and for the measure to fall within 
Article 92(1) of the Treaty. 
51 The third part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected. 
52 
The fourth part of the first ground of appeal relates to paragraphs 118 to 122 of 
the judgment under appeal, in which the Court of First Instance held that the 
Commission erred in fact with regard to the implementation of the exemption 
from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT inasmuch as it found 
that the system of the permanent deposit with the French Treasury, offsetting the 
cash-flow benefits resulting from the altered time of deduction, had existed only 
since 1989 when it had begun to apply in 1969. 
53 
The appellant contends that the Court of First Instance set aside the 
Commission's assessment regarding the period after 1 January 1989 by relying 
on matters which essentially relate to the period before that date. Furthermore, 
the Court of First Instance could not rely solely on those matters in order to 
conclude that the Commission's assessment in respect of the entire period after 
1 January 1989 was erroneous. In this respect, the judgment of the Court of First 
Instance is, in its submission, vitiated by defective reasoning and, in any event, by 
an inadequate statement of grounds. 
I - 3332 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
54 
Those objections cannot be upheld since they are based on an incorrect analysis 
of the judgment under appeal. Contrary to the appellant's assertions, the Court of 
First Instance did not hold that the exemption from the one-month delay rule for 
the deduction of VAT constituted State aid as regards the period after 
1 January 1989 but merely found that, given the manifest errors of fact on 
which the whole of the Commission's line of argument was founded, it was 
impossible for it to rule as to whether or not State aid was involved. Such an 
assessment of the substance falls outside the scope of the appellate review which 
the Court of Justice may carry out. Accordingly, the final part of the first ground 
of appeal must be rejected as inadmissible. 
Second ground of appeal 
55 
In its second ground of appeal, the French Republic contends that the judgment 
under appeal is vitiated by an error of law inasmuch as the Court of First Instance 
held in paragraph 185 that the contested decision infringed Article 93(2) of the 
Treaty by limiting the temporal scope of the French authorities' obligation to 
require repayment of the aid derived from the PMU's exemption from the housing 
levy to the period after 11 January 1991, the date on which the procedure against 
the French Republic was opened, when reimbursement of the State aid should 
have been required from the date from which it was declared incompatible with 
the common market, that is to say from 1989. 
56 
It should be recalled that the Commission found in the contested decision that the 
PMU's exemption from the housing levy was incompatible with the Treaty from 
1989; however, it considered that the PMU had to repay the corresponding sums 
only from the date on which the procedure was opened in January 1991, because 
until that time the PMU entertained legitimate expectations as to the legality of 
the exemption by reason of a judgment of the French Conseil d'État according to 
which operations of the racecourse undertakings were agricultural and therefore 
qualified for exemption from the housing levy. 
I - 3333 


JUDGMENT OF 16. 5. 2000 — CASE C-83/98 P 
57 The Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 184 of the judgment under appeal 
that the Commission could not itself take into account the recipient's legitimate 
expectations, as invoked by the Member State, in order to set aside the 
requirement that aid considered by it to be incompatible with the common 
market should be repaid. 
58 According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of 
law. More specifically, it complains that the Court of First Instance has denied the 
Commission the possibility of examining a Member State's argument that a 
recipient of aid entertained a legitimate expectation as to its legality. It adds that 
the position adopted by the Court of First Instance makes the procedure 
excessively cumbersome, since it does not allow a fundamental argument directly 
affecting the question of recovery of the aid to be considered at the stage of the 
Commission's review. 
59 
It is unnecessary to examine whether the Court of First Instance was right in 
stating, at paragraph 183 of the judgment under appeal, that it is not for the State 
concerned, but for the recipient undertaking, in the context of proceedings before 
the public authorities or before the national courts, to plead exceptional 
circumstances on the basis of which it had entertained legitimate expectations, 
justifying refusal to repay unlawful aid. It need merely be stated that, as Ladbroke 
correctly submitted before the Court of First Instance, the reasoning in the 
contested decision was in any event inadequate so far as concerns waiver of the 
requirement to repay part of the aid declared incompatible with the common 
market. 
60 
In the contested decision, the Commission merely referred to the existence of the 
judgment of the Conseil d'État, without in any way indicating why, in its opinion, 
it amounted to an exceptional circumstance liable to give rise to legitimate 
expectations on the part of the recipient of the aid notwithstanding the failure to 
comply with the rules laid down in Article 93 of the Treaty. 
I - 3334 


FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 
61 The Court of First Instance was accordingly right to conclude that the contested 
decision had to be annulled in so far as it required repayment of the aid deriving 
from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy only from the opening of the 
procedure, that is to say from 11 January 1991. 
62 
The second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected. 
63 
Accordingly, neither ground of appeal relied on by the appellant is well founded 
and the appeal must be dismissed. 
Costs 
64 
Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to the appeal 
procedure by virtue of Article 118, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay 
the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since the 
Commission has requested that the French Republic be ordered to pay the costs 
and the French Republic has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to pay the 
costs.
