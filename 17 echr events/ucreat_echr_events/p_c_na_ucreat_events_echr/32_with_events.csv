"The applicant is a British citizen, born in 1952, and resident in Leicester.",non-argumentative,['citizen bear citizen']
"He is represented before the Commission by Mr. Peter Snow, Honorary Legal Officer of the Campaign for Justice in Divorce.",non-argumentative,[]
"The facts of the present case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows:",non-argumentative,['fact submit party']
"The applicant refers to the summary of the facts, which gave rise to his application, made by the Court of Appeal in his case:",non-argumentative,"['applicant refer summary', 'which give rise', 'which give application', 'application make case']"
(The applicant) married his wife on 11 August 1984.,non-argumentative,['applicant marry wife']
"They had one son, who was born in 1985.",non-argumentative,['they have son']
On 11 November 1987 the parties separated for a period of about two weeks before becoming reconciled.,non-argumentative,['party separate period']
"On 21 October 1989, as a result of further matrimonial difficulties, the wife left the matrimonial home with their son, who was then aged four, and returned to live with her parents.",non-argumentative,"['wife leave home', 'wife leave son']"
She had by this time already consulted solicitors regarding her matrimonial affairs and indeed had left a letter for (the applicant) in which she informed him that she intended to petition for divorce.,non-argumentative,"['she sulte solicitother', 'solicitother regard affair', 'she inform he', 'she intend divorce', 'letter petition divorce']"
However no legal proceedings had been taken by her before the incident took place which gave rise to these criminal proceedings.,non-argumentative,"['incident take place', 'which give rise', 'which give proceeding']"
It seems that (the applicant) had on 23 October spoken to his wife by telephone indicating that it was his intention also to 'see about a divorce'.,non-argumentative,"['applicant speak wife', 'applicant speak telephone']"
"Shortly before 9 o'clock on the evening of 12 November 1989, that is to say some 22 days after the wife had returned to live with her parents, and while the parents were out, (the applicant) forced his way into the parents' house and attempted to have sexual intercourse with the wife against her will.",non-argumentative,"['wife return parent', 'applicant force way', 'applicant force parent house']"
"In the course of that attempt he assaulted her, in particular by squeezing her neck with both hands.",non-argumentative,"['he assault she', 'he assault neck']"
The applicant was charged with rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.,non-argumentative,"['applicant charge rape', 'applicant charge assault', 'assault occasion harm']"
At his trial before the Leicester Crown Court on 30 July 1990 it was submitted that the charge of rape was one which was not known to the law by reason of the fact that the applicant was the husband of the alleged victim.,non-argumentative,"['number know law', 'number know reason']"
"The submission was based on the pronouncement of the common law made by Sir Matthew Hale in his ""History of the Pleas of the Crown"", p. 629, published in 1736:",non-argumentative,"['submission base pronouncement', 'pronouncement make history']"
"But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.",non-argumentative,"['wife give herself', 'wife give kind', 'wife give husband']"
"The trial judge, Owen J., ruled that the charge could go to the jury.",non-argumentative,[]
"He found, inter alia, that there was sufficient evidence to indicate an implied agreement to a separation and a withdrawal of consent.",non-argumentative,"['he find agreement', 'there be evidence', 'evidence indicate agreement', 'evidence indicate withdrawal']"
"He also considered that the common law recognised an exception to the concept of marital immunity where there has been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, and that there was again sufficient evidence to indicate that this exception applied.",non-argumentative,"['he sidere there', 'company mon law recognise exception', 'withdrawal accompany indication', 'company send intercourse', 'company terminate there', 'there be evidence']"
"The applicant then pleaded guilty to attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.",non-argumentative,"['applicant plead rape', 'assault occasion harm']"
He appealed.,non-argumentative,[]
The Court of Appeal held on 14 March 1991 as follows:,non-argumentative,[]
"Since the rule that a husband could not be guilty of raping his wife if he forced her to have sexual intercourse against her will was an anachronistic and offensive common law fiction which no longer represented the position of a wife in present-day society, it should no longer be applied.",non-argumentative,"['rule rape wife', 'he force she', 'he force intercourse', 'he force will', 'rule have intercourse', 'rule have will', 'which represent position']"
"Instead, the principle to be applied was that a rapist remained a rapist subject to the criminal law irrespective of his relationship with his victim.",non-argumentative,['rapist remain rapist subject']
The charge of rape had therefore properly been left to the jury.,non-argumentative,['charge leave jury']
The appeal would accordingly be dismissed.,non-argumentative,[]
The Court of Appeal's decision was unanimously upheld by the House of Lords on 23 October 1991.,non-argumentative,[]
It considered that Sir Matthew Hale's common law proposition could not preclude the application of section 1 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 concerning the offence of rape.,non-argumentative,"['<NAME> preclude application', 'section cerne offence']"
The House of Lords' judgment was summarised by a Times Law Report as follows:,non-argumentative,[]
For over 150 years after the publication of Hale's work there appeared to have been no reported case in which judicial consideration was given to this proposition.,non-argumentative,['company sideration give to']
It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded as an accurate statement of the common law of England.,non-argumentative,['proposition regard statement']
"The common law was however capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments.",non-argumentative,[]
Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in those respects at the time it was enunciated.,non-argumentative,['<NAME> reflect state']
Since then the status of women and particularly of married women had changed out of all recognition.,non-argumentative,[]
Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies one of the most important changes was that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband,non-argumentative,['marriage regard partnership']
Hale's proposition involved that by marriage a wife gave her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happened to be feeling at the time,non-argumentative,"['wife give she', 'wife give company', 'wife give circumstance', 'wife give state', 'company send intercourse', 'she happen time', 'state feel time']"
In modern times any reasonable person had to regard that conception as quite unacceptable.,non-argumentative,['person have company ception']
The position was that part of Hale's proposition had been departed from in a series of decided cases.,non-argumentative,['part depart series']
On the ground of principle there was no good reason why the whole proposition of 'marital exemption' to rape should not be held inapplicable in modern times.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'proposition hold inapplicable', 'proposition hold time']"
The only question was whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presented an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course.,non-argumentative,['section present obstacle']
The argument was that 'unlawful' in that subsection meant outside the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,['that mean bond']
That was not the most natural meaning of the word which normally described something which was contrary to some law or enactment or was done without lawful justification or excuse.,non-argumentative,"['which describe something', 'word do justification']"
Certainly in modern times sexual intercourse outside marriage would not ordinarily be described as unlawful.,non-argumentative,[]
If the subsection proceeded on the basis that a woman on marriage gave a general consent to sexual intercourse there could be no question of intercourse with her by her husband being without consent.,non-argumentative,"['subsection proceed basis', 'woman give company', 'company send intercourse']"
There would thus be no point in enacting that only intercourse without consent outside marriage was to constitute rape.,non-argumentative,['company send marriage']
"There was another important context to section 1 (1), namely the existence of the exceptions to the marital exemption established by cases decided before the Act was passed.",non-argumentative,"['there be company text', 'exception establish case']"
Sexual intercourse in any of the cases covered by the exceptions still took place within the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,"['case ere exception', 'intercourse take place', 'intercourse take bond']"
So if 'unlawful' in the subsection meant 'outside the bond of marriage' it followed that sexual intercourse in a case which fell within the exceptions was not covered by the definition of rape not- withstanding that it was not consented to by the wife.,non-argumentative,"['unlawful mean bond', 'which fall exception', 'number company ere definition', 'number company sente to', 'number company sente wife']"
That involved that the exceptions had been impliedly abolished.,non-argumentative,[]
If the intention of Parliament was to abolish the exceptions it would have been expected to do so expressly and it was in fact inconceivable Parliament should have had such an intention.,non-argumentative,"['it expect it', '<ORG> have intention']"
In order that the exceptions might be preserved it would be necessary to construe 'unlawfully' so as to give it a meaning unique to that particular subsection and if the mind of the draughtsman has been directed to the existence of the exceptions he would surely have dealt with them specifically and not in such an oblique fashion.,non-argumentative,['mind direct existence']
The fact was it was clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent and that the use of the word in the subsection added nothing.,non-argumentative,['use add number hing']
There were no rational grounds for putting the suggested gloss on the word and it should be treated as mere surplusage in the enactment.,non-argumentative,"['there be ground', 'ground put gloss', 'ground put word', 'it treat surplusage']"
Section 1 (1) of 1976 Act presented no obstacle to the House declaring that in modern times the supposed marital exemption in rape formed no part of the law of England.,non-argumentative,"['section present number obstacle', 'exemption form number part']"
"Until the applicant's case the English courts, on the few occasions that they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly, had always recognised at least some form of immunity as attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage.",non-argumentative,"['company rt rape', 'company rt number', 'they front issue', 'form attach husband', 'form attach charge', 'form attach reason', 'number send to', 'intercourse deem wife', 'intercourse deem marriage', 'intercourse give wife', 'intercourse give marriage']"
"The eighteenth century proposition of Sir Matthew Hale quoted above has been upheld until recently, for example in the case of R. Kowalski (1987, 86, Cr. App. R 339), which concerned the question of whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault.",non-argumentative,"['century proposition uphold example', 'century proposition uphold case', 'company cerne question', 'wife sente act', 'act perform company', 'act amount assault']"
"Ian Kennedy J. giving the judgment of the court stated, obiter dicta,",non-argumentative,[]
"""It is clear, well-settled and ancient law that a man cannot, as actor, be guilty of rape upon his wife"" and he went on to say that that principle was ""dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi, by a separation order or, in certain circumstances, by a separation agreement""",non-argumentative,"['law settle law', 'he go company', 'company send intercourse', 'which arise state', 'company put separation agreement']"
"In another example, Lord Justice O'Connor in the R. v. Roberts case (1986 CLR 188) stated:",non-argumentative,[]
"""The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she cannot unilaterally withdraw it.""",non-argumentative,"['woman give company', 'company send to', 'husband have intercourse', 'husband have subsistence', 'she not withdraw it']"
Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976,non-argumentative,[]
"Section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides, in so far as it is material, as follows:",non-argumentative,[]
"""For the purposes of section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which relates to rape) a man commits rape if",non-argumentative,"['which relate rape', 'man company mit rape']"
"he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it...""",non-argumentative,"['he have intercourse', 'he have woman']"
"The applicant complains that he is a victim of a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, as well as Article 6.",non-argumentative,['applicant company plain violation']
The application was introduced on 31 March 1992 and registered on 19 June 1992.,non-argumentative,[]
On 12 October 1992 the Commission decided to communicate the application to the Government and to ask for written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> decide application']
"The Government's observations were submitted on 29 January 1993 after one extension in the time-limit fixed for that purpose, and the applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 24 March 1993.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> submit extension', 'extension fix purpose']"
"On 8 April 1993, the Commission granted the applicant legal aid.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> grant applicant', '<ORG> grant aid']"
"On 28 June 1993, the Commission decided to hold an oral hearing, consecutive to a hearing in the case of W. v. the United Kingdom (No. 20166/92).",non-argumentative,['<ORG> decide hearing']
"The European Commission of Human Rights sitting in private on 14 January 1994, the following members being present:",non-argumentative,[]
The applicant complains that he has been convicted in respect of conduct which at the relevant time did not constitute a criminal offence.,non-argumentative,"['he victe respect', 'company stitute offence']"
"He invokes Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention, which provides as follows:",non-argumentative,['he invoke article Art']
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.,non-argumentative,"['one hold guilty', 'one hold account', 'which stitute offence', 'which stitute time', 'number company stitute offence', 'number company stitute time']"
Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.,non-argumentative,['penalty impose one']
"This Article (Art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.",non-argumentative,"['number prejudice trial', 'number prejudice act', 'number prejudice punishment', 'act accord principle', 'principle recognise nation']"
"By the relevant time, Hale's proposition that a wife's consent to sexual intercourse was irrevocable was no longer good law.",non-argumentative,['wife company send intercourse']
English law did not therefore recognise any absolute immunity conferred on a husband who had sexual intercourse with a wife without her consent.,non-argumentative,"['number recognise immunity', 'company ferre husband', 'who have intercourse', 'who have wife']"
The applicant submits that his conviction for the attempted rape of his wife concerned conduct which did not at the relevant time constitute a criminal offence under United Kingdom law.,non-argumentative,['which number time']
No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.,non-argumentative,[]
The Government's observations were not solicited on this point.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> solicit point']
Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention provides in its first sentence as follows:,non-argumentative,['of provide sentence']
"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law...",non-argumentative,"['everyone entitle hearing', 'everyone entitle tribunal', 'tribunal establish law']"
The Commission recalls that the applicant complains that the courts erred in their construction of the 1976 Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act.,non-argumentative,['plain err company struction']
It is not for the Commission to re-assess these factual elements of the case before the domestic courts.,non-argumentative,"['<ORG> assess element', '<ORG> assess company']"
Insofar as it is alleged that as a result the applicant was wrongly convicted of an offence which did not exist at the relevant time it raises no separate issue under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.,non-argumentative,"['applicant victe offence', 'which exist time', 'it raise issue', 'it raise article art']"
DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application.,non-argumentative,[]
