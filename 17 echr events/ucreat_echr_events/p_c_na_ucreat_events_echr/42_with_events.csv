"The Commission observes that the basis of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention is that, before proceedings are brought in an international court, the state made answerable must have had an opportunity to redress the alleged damage by domestic means within the framework of its own legal system (cf. No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57).",premise,"['state make answerable', 'company have opportunity', 'state have opportunity', 'opportunity redress damage', 'opportunity redress mean', 'opportunity redress framework']"
