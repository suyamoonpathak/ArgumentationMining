"Concluding that such records cannot in general be relied upon to prove that a person was not taken into custody, the Court considers that the fact that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy's name was not in the custody record at the Diyarbakır Security Directorate does not itself prove that he was not in custody.",conclusion,['person take custody']
"On the other hand, the Court observes that the testimonies of Abdurrazak1, Halil, Nasır and Garipşah İkincisoy, who were detained at the Rapid Intervention Force, were balanced, detailed and consistent with each other.",premise,[]
It therefore accepts the evidence of the four witnesses who stated that they had seen Mehmet Şah when they were themselves being held on the same premises.,conclusion,"['it accept evidence', 'they see <NAME>', 'they hold premise']"

"Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out the circumstances when deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, to which no derogation is permitted.",premise,"['which safeguard right', 'article set circumstance', 'article rank provision']"
"Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe.",premise,"['it enshrine one', 'society make <ORG>']"

The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective,premise,[]
"In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances.",premise,"['<ORG> subject deprivation', '<ORG> subject scrutiny']"
Detained persons are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them.,premise,['duty protect they']
"Consequently, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused",conclusion,"['individual take police custody', 'individual take health']"
"The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of a detained individual is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (Orhan, cited above, § 326).",premise,"['obligation account treatment', 'individual die obligation']"
"Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention.",premise,"['event lie knowledge', 'injury occur detention']"

The Court has accepted above (paragraph 65) that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was taken into custody on 22 November 1993 and died on 23 November 1993 while he was under the control of the security authorities of the respondent state.,premise,"['Court accept paragraph', '<NAME> take custody']"
The Court draws very strong inferences from the lack of any documentary evidence indicating that Mehmet Şah was taken into custody.,premise,"['Court draw inference', 'Court draw lack', '<NAME> take custody']"
It has held in its earlier judgments that an unacknowledged detention would be life-threatening in the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1993,premise,['it hold judgment']
"(see Taş v. Turkey, no. 24396/94, § 66, 14 November 2000, Çiçek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, § 146, 27 February 2001, and Timurtaş, cited above, § 85).",premise,[]
"In view of the above, the Court concludes that Mehmet Şah was deprived of his life in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the respondent State.",conclusion,"['<NAME> deprive life', '<NAME> deprive circumstance', 'circumstance engage responsibility']"
"Furthermore, as explained below (see paragraph 79), the autopsy examination, which had critical importance in determining the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, was defective in fundamental aspects.",premise,"['importance determine circumstance', 'circumstance surround death']"
"In this respect, the Court is further struck by the refusal of the domestic authorities to deliver Mehmet Şah's body to his family, who intended to request a detailed autopsy.",premise,"['Court strike refusal', 'refusal deliver <NAME>', 'refusal deliver family', 'who intend autopsy', 'family request autopsy']"
The Court therefore concludes that it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt that Mehmet Şah died during a clash.,conclusion,['it not establish doubt']
The Court therefore concludes that it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt that Mehmet Şah died during a clash.,premise,['it not establish doubt']
"The authorities have thus failed to establish the real circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, who was under their custody.",premise,"['authority fail circumstance', 'circumstance surround death']"

"In view of the above, the Court concludes that Mehmet Şah was deprived of his life in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the respondent State.",premise,"['<NAME> deprive life', '<NAME> deprive circumstance', 'circumstance engage responsibility']"
There is nothing to suggest that this was necessary for any of the reasons set out in the second paragraph of Article 2 of the Convention.,premise,"['there be number hing', 'reason set paragraph']"
There has therefore been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in that respect.,conclusion,[]
"The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility.",premise,"['which protect right', 'case involve state agent', 'death occur responsibility']"
What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances.,premise,"['form achieve purpose', 'achieve vary circumstance']"
"However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention.",premise,"['authority act motion', 'matter have company']"
"They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII).",premise,"['they not leave it', 'they not leave initiative']"
"For an investigation into an alleged unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events (Güleç v. Turkey, judgment of 27 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, §§ 81-82, and Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, §§ 91-92, ECHR 1999-III).",conclusion,"['it regard Turkey judgment', 'person carry investigation']"
"The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (Oğur, cited above, § 88).",premise,"['sense lead determination', 'force use case']"
"This is not an obligation of result, but of means.",premise,[]
"The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye-witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 109, ECHR 1999 IV).",premise,"['authority take step', 'company cerne incident', 'evidence include eye witness testimony', 'evidence see <ORG>']"
"Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (Orhan, cited above, § 355).",conclusion,"['which undermine ability', 'ability establish cause', 'deficiency risk standard']"
"Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that the investigation conducted by the public prosecutor was defective in a number of fundamental aspects.",premise,['investigation company ducte prosecutor']
"The Court is struck by the heavy reliance placed by the public prosecutor, who investigated the death of Mehmet Şah, on the conclusion of the incident report dated 23 November 1993.",premise,"['Court strike reliance', 'reliance place prosecutor', 'who investigate death', 'who investigate company clusion', 'incident report date number ember']"
According to this incident report an intense clash had taken place which lasted for twenty minutes.,premise,"['clash take place', 'which last minute']"
"Furthermore, according to the ballistic report 251 bullet cases had been recovered from the place of the incident.",premise,['bullet case recover place']
However it does not appear from the file whether the public prosecutor compared the facts as stated in the incident report with the photographs of the hut taken after the incident.,premise,"['it appear file', '<ORG> pare fact', '<ORG> pare photograph', 'fact state incident report', 'photograph take incident']"
The public prosecutor appears to have excluded the possibility that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah could have been different than those stated in the incident report.,premise,"['prosecutor appear possibility', 'circumstance surround death', 'possibility state incident report']"
"In this respect, it should also be recalled that the applicants had brought to the public prosecutor's attention the possibility that Mehmet Şah could have been killed under torture.",premise,"['applicant bring possibility', 'applicant bring attention', 'possibility kill torture']"
"Without taking statements from the family members of the deceased who were also arrested that day or the police officers who were involved in the clash, the public prosecutor concluded that Mehmet Şah had died during a clash.",premise,"['who involve clash', '<NAME> die clash']"
It further appears from the autopsy report that Mehmet Şah was shot from behind by a bullet which entered from the upper part of his shoulder and exited from below his chest.,premise,"['it appear autopsy report', '<NAME> shoot bullet', 'which enter part']"
It is striking that the public prosecutor did not seek any further explanation as to how a person involved in an intense clash could be shot from behind and most probably by a person who was standing above him.,premise,"['it strike explanation', 'prosecutor seek explanation', 'person involve clash', 'person shoot explanation']"
The Court also observes in this context that the autopsy report lacked valuable and important information which would clarify the circumstance surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah.,premise,"['Court observe company text', 'autopsy report lack information', 'which clarify circumstance', 'circumstance surround death']"
The absence of any indication about the approximate positions of the person who fired and the victim and the distance between them at the moment of the shot as well as the size of the bullet entry and exit wounds constitute important deficiencies.,premise,['absence stitute deficiency']
"In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention.",conclusion,[]
"In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention.",premise,[]
It accordingly holds that there has been a violation of Article 2 on this account also.,conclusion,[]
The Court refers to its finding above where it has established that Mehmet Şah had died while he was under the control of the domestic authorities (see paragraph 65).,premise,['Court refer finding']
"However contrary to the applicants' allegations of torture, it observes from the photographs and the autopsy report that there were no marks or injuries on the body of Mehmet Şah which were consistent with the allegations of torture.",premise,"['it observe photograph', 'it observe autopsy report', 'there be number mark']"
It notes that the applicants' allegations of torture are solely based on the assumption that some of the persons who were detained in the Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters had heard the cries of Mehmet Şah.,premise,"['applicants allegation base assumption', 'some hear cry']"
"On the basis of the material in its possession and noting that the allegation of ill-treatment is not corroborated by any other evidence, the Court notes that the applicants' complaints are based on hypothesis and speculation rather than on reliable evidence.",conclusion,"['allegation roborate evidence', '<ORG> e hypothesis', 'applicant company plaint base hypothesis', 'applicant company plaint base speculation']"
"On the basis of the material in its possession and noting that the allegation of ill-treatment is not corroborated by any other evidence, the Court notes that the applicants' complaints are based on hypothesis and speculation rather than on reliable evidence.",premise,"['allegation roborate evidence', '<ORG> e hypothesis', 'applicant company plaint base hypothesis', 'applicant company plaint base speculation']"
"In these circumstances, and having regard to its conclusion under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court does not find it appropriate to draw inferences proposed by the applicants as to whether torture or ill-treatment occurred (see, in this respect, Tanlı, cited above, § 159).",premise,['inference propose applicant']
"As regards the applicants' submission concerning the effects of the events on themselves, the Court has no doubt of the profound suffering caused by the death of Mehmet Şah.",premise,"['applicants submission company cerne effect', 'Court have number doubt', 'suffering cause death']"
It finds no basis however for finding a violation of Article 3 in this context.,premise,"['it find number basis', 'number basis find violation']"
The Court finds that it has not been established that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. It consequently finds no violation of that provision.,conclusion,['company find number violation']
"In so far as the applicants complain about the police custody of Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy, the Court recalls in the first place that the term victim in Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or the omission which is at issue (see Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p.30, § 66).",premise,"['applicant company police custody', 'Court recall place', 'term denote person', 'person affect act']"
The Court observes that the two applicants are not personally concerned by the detention of these four persons.,premise,[]
"Furthermore, they cannot substantiate the reason why these persons have themselves refrained from lodging applications with the Court.",premise,"['they not substantiate reason', 'person refrain application', 'reason lodge application']"
"Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicants cannot claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention regarding the police custody of Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy.",conclusion,"['<ORG> clude police custody', 'applicant not claim police custody', 'meaning regard police custody']"
The Court is therefore satisfied that there were reasonable and sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants had been involved in an offence.,premise,"['there be ground', 'applicant involve offence']"
It has examined these elements and has not disclosed any manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary conclusions drawn by the competent authorities from them.,premise,"['it examine element', 'company clusion draw authority']"
"It thus sees no reason to doubt that the elements of which the authorities disposed were sufficient to believe, at that time, that the applicants had been involved in an offence.",premise,"['it see number reason', 'number reason believe time', 'applicant involve offence']"
"In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. C. Article 5 § 3 of the Convention",conclusion,[]
The Court reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c).,premise,"['Court reiterate arrest', 'reasonableness form part', 'which lay article']"
"Having a reasonable suspicion presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26775/95, § 155, ECHR 2000-IV).",premise,"['have presuppose existence', 'which satisfy observer', 'which satisfy <ORG>', 'person mitte offence']"
"What may be regarded as reasonable will however depend on all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, § 32).",premise,['regard depend circumstance']
The Court recalls in particular that the reasonable suspicion referred to in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention does not mean that the suspected person's guilt must at that stage be established.,premise,[]
"It is precisely the purpose of the investigation that the reality and nature of the offences laid against the accused should definitely be proved (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300 A, p. 27, § 55).",premise,[]
"Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 does not even presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while the applicant was in custody (see Erdagöz v. Turkey, judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2314, § 51).",premise,"['paragraph presuppose applicant', 'police obtain evidence', 'evidence bring charge', 'evidence bring point', 'evidence bring custody']"
"In the instant case the Court observes that the applicants were taken into custody, on suspicion of aiding and abetting the PKK and for being involved in the events which resulted in the killing of a police officer and the wounding of another.",premise,"['court observe suspicion', 'applicant take custody', 'applicant take suspicion', 'suspicion aid suspicion', 'suspicion abet <ORG>', 'which result killing', 'which result wounding']"
The Court is therefore satisfied that there were reasonable and sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants had been involved in an offence.,conclusion,"['there be ground', 'applicant involve offence']"
"Concerning the police custody of the first applicant, the Court recalls that the fact that a detained person is not charged or brought before a court does not in itself amount to a violation of the first part of Article 5 § 3.",premise,"['person charge fact', 'fact amount violation']"
"No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released “promptly” before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, § 52, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, § 58).",premise,"['violation arise <NAME>', '<ORG> cite <NAME>', '<NAME> cite pp']"
"The Court finds that the release of the first applicant, who was held in police custody for no more than three days, may be regarded as “prompt” for these purposes.",conclusion,"['who hold police custody', 'who hold day', 'release regard purpose']"
"The Court finds that the release of the first applicant, who was held in police custody for no more than three days, may be regarded as “prompt” for these purposes.",premise,"['who hold police custody', 'who hold day', 'release regard purpose']"
"Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in his case.",conclusion,[]
"As to the length of the police custody of the second applicant, the Court observes that he was held in police custody for eleven days from 22 November to 3 December 1993.",premise,"['he hold police custody', 'he hold day']"
"It recalls that in the Brogan and Others case it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict constraints as to the time laid down by Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism",premise,"['which last company trol', 'detention fall company straint']"
"(see Brogan and Others, cited above, p. 33, § 62).",premise,[]
"Even though the investigation of terrorist offences, as supposed in this case, presents the authorities with special problems, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain the second applicant for eleven days without judicial intervention.",premise,"['investigation suppose case', 'investigation present authority', 'investigation present problem']"
Therefore the Court concludes that there has been a breach of Article 5 § 3 in respect of the second applicant.,conclusion,[]
"Concerning the first applicant, the Court recalls its finding under Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 103) that he was released before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible",premise,"['Court recall finding', 'he release company', 'he release detention']"
and concludes that there has accordingly been no violation of Article 5 § 4 in respect of the first applicant.,conclusion,[]
"Concerning the second applicant, the Court notes that a judge did not intervene until the end of his police custody, that is to say eleven days after his arrest.",premise,['judge intervene end']
"Having regard to the conclusion it reached with regard to Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 106), the Court considers that such a lengthy period sits ill with the notion of “speedily”",premise,"['it reach regard', 'period sit number ion']"
"(see Sakık and Others, cited above, § 53).",premise,[]
"In conclusion, there has been a breach of Article 5 § 4 of the convention in respect of the second applicant.",conclusion,[]
"In respect of the first applicant, the Court reiterates that this provision guarantees an enforceable right to compensation only to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention contrary to Article 5 of the Convention",premise,"['Court reiterate arrest', 'provision guarantee right']"
"(see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 755, § 50).",premise,[]
"In the absence of any such finding in the present case, the Court is of the opinion that there is no violation of Article 5 § 5 in respect of the first applicant.",conclusion,['there be number violation']
"As regards the second applicant who was held in custody for eleven days, the Court notes that the domestic legislation which was in force at the time of the events permitted police custody up to fifteen days without being brought before a judge.",premise,"['who hold custody', 'who hold day', 'legislation permit police custody']"
"Accordingly, a compensation request for police custody which lasted for eleven days would not succeed before the domestic courts.",premise,['which last day']
The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant.,conclusion,[]
"As the Court has held many times, Article 13 guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order.",premise,"['article guarantee availability', 'remedy enforce substance', 'they happen order', 'remedy secure order']"
"The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision.",conclusion,"['remedy deal substance', 'contracting state afford discretion', 'they form Convention obligation', 'they form provision']"
"The applicants' complaints in this regard are therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52, and Kaya, cited above, § 107).",premise,[]
The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy.,premise,"['authority have obligation', 'obligation carry investigation']"
"For the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 78-80), no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted in accordance with Article 13, the requirements of which may be broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Articles 2 and 3 (Kaya, cited above, pp. 330-331, § 107, Salman, cited above, § 123, and Nuray Şen v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 25354/94, § 193, 30 March 2004).",premise,"['investigation sidere accordance', 'obligation impose obligation', 'obligation cite pp']"
The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.,conclusion,[]
"The Court recalls that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of the individual petition instituted by former Article 25 (now replaced by Article 34) that applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Convention organs without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see Şarli v. Turkey, no. 24490/94, § 84, 22 May 2001).",premise,"['Court recall pressure', 'petition institute article number', 'article number replace article', 'article municate <ORG>', 'article subject form', 'pressure withdraw pressure', 'pressure modify company plaint']"
"In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a convention remedy.",premise,"['pressure include number', 'act design act', 'act dissuade act', 'act discourage applicant', 'act discourage company vention remedy', 'act pursue company vention remedy']"
"Turning to the facts of the instant case, the Court observes that it is accepted by the parties that the applicant was indeed interviewed by the public prosecutor on 6 June 1995 as alleged upon the instructions of the Ministry of Justice International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate concerning his application with the Commission (see paragraphs 39 and 56).",premise,"['it accept paragraph', 'it accept party', 'applicant interview prosecutor', '<ORG> cerne application']"
The Court therefore finds that the applicant was subjected to indirect and improper pressure to make statements in respect of his application to the Commission which interfered with the free exercise of his right of individual petition guaranteed under Article 25.,conclusion,"['applicant subject pressure', 'pressure make statement', 'which interfere exercise', 'right guarantee article']"
The Court therefore finds that the applicant was subjected to indirect and improper pressure to make statements in respect of his application to the Commission which interfered with the free exercise of his right of individual petition guaranteed under Article 25.,premise,"['applicant subject pressure', 'pressure make statement', 'which interfere exercise', 'right guarantee article']"
The Court accordingly holds that the respondent State has failed to comply with its obligations under former Article 25 of the Convention.,conclusion,['state fail obligation']
"The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision.",premise,"['remedy deal substance', 'contracting state afford discretion', 'they form Convention obligation', 'they form provision']"
The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention.,premise,[]
"Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (Aksoy, cited above, § 95, Aydın, cited above, § 103, and Kaya, cited above, § 89).",premise,"['remedy require article', 'exercise hinder act']"
The nature of the rights safeguarded under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention has implications for Article 13.,premise,"['right safeguard right', 'nature have implication']"
"Where there is an arguable claim that an individual has been tortured or subjected to serious ill-treatment, or deprived of his or her life, by agents of the State, Article 13 requires, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the treatment in question or the deprivation of life, including effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (Salman, cited above, § 121).",premise,"['there be claim', 'individual torture claim', 'claim subject treatment', 'claim deprive life', 'claim deprive agent', 'investigation lead identification', 'investigation lead punishment', 'deprivation include access']"
"On the basis of the evidence adduced in the present case, the Court has found that the Government are responsible under Article 2 of the Convention for the death of Mehmet Şah while he was under custody.",premise,['evidence adduce case']
"The applicants' complaints in this regard are therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52, and Kaya, cited above, § 107).",conclusion,[]
"The applicants complained that there had been a serious interference with the exercise of their right of individual petition, in breach of Article 25 of the Convention (now replaced by Article 34), which provides as follows:",premise,[]
"“The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto.

The applicants submitted that on 6 June 1995 the first applicant was taken before the public prosecutor for interrogation concerning his application with the Commission.,premise,['applicant take prosecutor']
He was questioned about his individual application and was asked whether the signatures on the letter of authority and his statement to the Human Rights Association belonged to him.,premise,['he question application']
The first applicant had to sign his statement under pressure and stated that he would retract his application.,premise,"['applicant have statement', 'applicant have pressure', 'he retract application']"
The Government denied these assertions. They insisted that the authorities had never brought pressure on the applicants to withdraw their application to the Convention organs.,conclusion,"['government deny assertion', 'authority never bring pressure', 'authority never bring applicant', 'pressure withdraw application']"
