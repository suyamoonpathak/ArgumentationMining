The applicant considered that the law of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to establish in advance whether in the eyes of a jury a particular publication would constitute an offence.,premise,['publication stitute offence']
"Moreover, it was practically impossible to know what predictions an administrative body - the British Board of Film Classification - would make as to the outcome of a hypothetical prosecution.",premise,[]
"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations.",conclusion,['applicant company ld number expect result']
"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations.",premise,['applicant company ld number expect result']
"The requirement of foreseeability which flows from the expression ""prescribed by law"" was therefore not fulfilled.",conclusion,"['which flow expression', 'expression prescribe law']"
it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts.,premise,['tribunal reach company clusion']
This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable.,premise,[]
"Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing ""contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible"" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous.",premise,"['way publish matter', 'matter relate matter', 'law seek detail']"
The Government contested this claim:,conclusion,['<ORG> test claim']
"The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national ""law"", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.",premise,"['which include statute', 'which include law', 'precision enable company', 'precision enable advice', 'precision enable degree', 'precision enable circumstance', 'precision foresee degree', 'precision foresee circumstance']"
"A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31).",premise,"['that fer discretion', 'scope indicate clarity', 'manner indicate clarity', 'aim give individual', 'aim give protection']"
"It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant’s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 24 above).",premise,"['it infringe provision', '<ORG> act power', '<ORG> act section']"
The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition.,premise,"['offence not lend itself', 'offence not lend definition']"
"National authorities must therefore be afforded a degree of flexibility in assessing whether the facts of a particular case fall within the accepted definition of the offence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky judgment cited above at paragraph 40, p. 73, para. 41).",conclusion,"['authority afford degree', 'fact fall definition', '<NAME> cite paragraph para']"
"In his submission, the expression ""rights of others"" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended.",premise,['expression right refer right number']
It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people’s viewing the video work without being shocked.,premise,"['right avoid disturbance', 'people view video work']"
"The applicant contested the Government’s assertion that his video work was refused a certificate for distribution in order to ""protect the right of citizens not to be offended in their religious feelings"".",conclusion,"['applicant company test <ORG>', 'video work refuse certificate', '<ORG> protect right', 'right offend feeling']"
"Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the ""necessity"" of the interference.",premise,"['there be need', 'matter assess necessity']"
It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith.,premise,['law extend faith']
"Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above).",premise,['anomaly recognise paragraph']
"However, it is not for the European Court to rule in abstracto as to the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention.",premise,[]
The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it,premise,['law protect belief']
The uncontested fact that the law of blasphemy does not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the United Kingdom does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim pursued in the present context.,premise,"['law treat religion', 'law treat footing', 'fact detract legitimacy', 'aim pursue company text']"
The refusal to grant a certificate for the distribution of Visions of Ecstasy consequently had a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).,conclusion,"['refusal grant certificate', 'refusal have aim', 'refusal have article para']"
The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it,premise,['law protect belief']
"(see, for example, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 18, para. 33).",conclusion,[]
The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.,premise,['company stitute one']
"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities.",premise,"['exercise carry duty', 'exercise carry responsibility']"
"Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49).",premise,"['duty avoid .', 'expression see <ORG>', '<ORG> cite paragraph pp']"
"No restriction on freedom of expression, whether in the context of religious beliefs or in any other, can be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) unless it satisfies, inter alia, the test of necessity as required by the second paragraph of that Article (art. 10-2).",conclusion,"['it satisfy test', 'test require paragraph']"
"indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed.",premise,[]
"Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice.",premise,['protection provide panoply']
"In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",premise,"['company taine number obscenity number pornography', 'company taine number element']"
"According to the applicant, there was no ""pressing social need"" to ban a video work on the uncertain assumption that it would breach the law of blasphemy;",conclusion,"['there be need', 'need ban video work', 'need ban assumption', 'it breach law']"
This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings.,premise,"['argument present applicant', 'argument present company']"
"Moreover, it was open to the applicant to challenge the decision of the Appeals Committee in proceedings for judicial review (see paragraph 30 above).",premise,[]
"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",conclusion,"['threshold embody definition', 'reason justify measure', 'reason sidere purpose']"
"Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive.",premise,[]
"It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46).",premise,"['it submit applicant', 'video work reach audience', 'feature film cite paragraph']"
The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.,conclusion,"['Christian view video', 'need impose restriction', 'need impose distribution']"
"Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above).",premise,"['risk company reduce distribution', 'ld reduce distribution']"
"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it.",premise,"['film dispense video box', 'which include description']"
"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities.",premise,[]
"In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence.",premise,"['authority bear development', 'authority bear mind', 'authority see paragraph', 'authority see company sider', '<ORG> reach public', 'it cause offence']"
The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above.,premise,"['box include warning', 'use see paragraph']"
"In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public.",premise,"['position make assessment', 'position take difficulty', 'position take account', 'difficulty protect public']"
It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution.,premise,"['measure take authority', 'measure amount ban']"
"However, this was an understandable consequence of the opinion of the competent authorities that the distribution of the video would infringe the criminal law and of the refusal of the applicant to amend or cut out the objectionable sequences (see paragraph 13 above).",premise,"['distribution infringe law', 'refusal amend refusal', 'refusal cut sequence', 'company sequence see paragraph']"
Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.,conclusion,['authority overstep margin']
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",premise,"['fact remain company ground', 'there be company ground', '<ORG> impose restriction', '<ORG> impose basis']"
In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.,premise,[]
It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.,premise,[]
"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",premise,"['threshold embody definition', 'reason justify measure', 'reason sidere purpose']"
The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.,premise,"['Christian view video', 'need impose restriction', 'need impose distribution']"
Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.,premise,['authority overstep margin']
Against this background the national authorities were entitled to consider that the impugned measure was justified as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Art. 10-2). There has therefore been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (Art. 10).,conclusion,[]
"Admittedly, it is regrettable that the protection afforded by this legislation does not apply to other religions, for such a limitation makes no sense in 1996 now that we have the United Nations and UNESCO instruments on tolerance.",premise,"['protection afford legislation', 'protection apply religion', 'limitation make number sense', 'limitation make number', 'we have <ORG>', 'we have <ORG>']"
"However, the European Convention on Human Rights does not, on the one hand, prohibit legislation of this type, which is found in a number of member States, and, on the other hand, it leaves scope for review under Article 14 (art. 14).",premise,"['European Convention number hand', 'European Convention number legislation', 'which find number', 'it leave scope', 'it leave article']"
In the present case no complaint had been made to the European Court under that Article (art. 14).,premise,['number company plaint make article art']
The Court had to decide the case under Article 10 (art. 10).,conclusion,"['Court have case', 'Court have article']"
"instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had been a video showing, for example, the anti-clerical Voltaire having sexual relations with some prince or king.",premise,"['video show example', '<NAME> have relation', '<NAME> have prince']"
The decision not to grant a certificate might possibly have been justifiable and justified if,conclusion,['decision number grant certificate']
"What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works.",premise,"['I write subject', 'I write judge', 'I write case', 'write apply number', 'write apply press', 'write apply form', 'form include video work']"
"Judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 46",premise,[]
"This was a pure case of prior restraint, a form of interference which is, in my view, unacceptable in the field of freedom of expression.",conclusion,[]
Section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984,premise,[]
"Of course, anything so decided by such authority needs reasonable justification and must not be arbitrary.",premise,['anything need justification']
"It must, if contested, be subject to judicial review, and it must not have the effect of preventing the courts from deciding, as the case may be, whether the work concerned deserves, or does not deserve, any sanction under existing law.",premise,"['it have effect', 'effect prevent company', 'company deserve work', 'work deserve sanction', 'work deserve law']"
"Under the system established by the Video Recordings Act 1984 the British Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee may determine that certain video works are not suitable for being classified in any of its three categories , and they can thus ban them absolutely ab initio.",conclusion,"['<ORG> determine they', 'number classify category', 'they ban they']"
This was indeed what actually happened in respect of the piece in issue in the present case.,premise,['what happen respect']
It certainly goes too far. 4.,premise,[]
"To the extent that the criminal law of blasphemy might have been infringed by the applicant, I would observe that the necessity of such laws is very much open to question.",premise,['law infringe applicant']
"I would rather join Mr Patten’s remark that for the faithful ""the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers"" .",conclusion,['I join <NAME>']
"I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society"".",premise,[]
The British Board of Film Classification and the five-member panel of the VAC took the view that the applicant would commit an offence of blasphemy if his video work Visions of Ecstasy were to be distributed (see paragraph 20 of the judgment).,premise,"['<ORG> take view', 'member panel take view']"
In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference.,premise,"['there be interference', 'member call interference']"
The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.,premise,"['interference base opinion', 'they understand feeling']"
The actual opinion of believers remains unknown.,premise,[]
"I think that this is why we cannot conclude that the interference corresponded to a ""pressing social need"".",conclusion,['interference company respond need']
"The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment).",premise,['law protect religion']
The aim of the interference was therefore to protect the Christian faith alone and not other beliefs.,conclusion,[]
"As the Court has consistently held, the guarantees enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) apply not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that shock or disturb.",premise,"['<ORG> hold guarantee', 'guarantee enshrine article', 'that receive information']"
Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity.,premise,"['impression veye image', 'impression veye situation', 'which shock image', 'image disturb feeling']"
"In my view, the makers of the film in issue did not exceed the reasonable limit beyond which it can be said that objects of religious veneration have been reviled or ridiculed.",conclusion,"['maker exceed limit', 'number exceed limit', 'it say limit', 'object revile limit']"
"since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith.",premise,"['it base law', 'law limit protection']"
In any event - the applicant further submitted - the restriction on the film’s distribution could not pursue a legitimate aim,conclusion,['restriction pursue aim']
"The Government contended that the applicant’s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive.",premise,"['<ORG> tend it', 'it amount attack']"
"In those circumstances, in refusing to grant a classification certificate for the applicant’s video work, the national authorities only acted within their margin of appreciation.",conclusion,['authority act margin']
"The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above).",premise,"['refusal grant Visions', 'refusal grant distribution certificate', 'refusal intend right']"
The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context.,premise,"['applicant make reference', 'law see paragraph', 'which pursue aim']"
"As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries.",premise,"['observation file intervenother', 'observation see paragraph']"
It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.,premise,"['application become States', 'States repeal they']"
In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above).,premise,"['prosecution cerne blasphemy', 'prosecution bring year']"
"Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above).",premise,"['argument advance example', 'law discriminate faith']"
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",conclusion,"['fact remain company ground', 'there be company ground', '<ORG> impose restriction', '<ORG> impose basis']"
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49).",premise,['Otto Preminger Institut judgment cite paragraph para']
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",conclusion,"['fact remain company ground', 'there be company ground', '<ORG> impose restriction', '<ORG> impose basis']"
"Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ""the protection of the rights of others"" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions.",premise,['there be company ception']
"What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations.",premise,"['be vary time', 'be vary place', 'be vary era', 'era characterise array']"
"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35).",premise,"['position give opinion', 'restriction intend those', 'restriction intend material', 'restriction protect those', 'restriction protect material']"
This does not of course exclude final European supervision.,premise,"['this exclude supervision', 'number exclude supervision']"
Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material,premise,['action take material']
In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.,conclusion,[]
"Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60).",premise,"['case involve restraint', 'fact call scrutiny', 'call see mutatis mutandis']"
The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).,premise,"['reason rely authority', 'reason justify measure', 'measure interfere applicants freedom']"
"As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion.",premise,['law prohibit expression']
Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit.,premise,['opinion fall ambit']
"As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control.",premise,['company indicate paragraph']
"The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness.",premise,['use depict material']
"The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness.",premise,['degree stitute safeguard']
It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.,conclusion,[]
"The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48).",non-argumentative,"['United Kingdom recognise jurisdiction', '<ORG> refer article art']"
The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10).,non-argumentative,['fact disclose breach']

"It is true that Mr Wingrove says that it is intended that the sleeve or jacket for the video will provide ‘basic historical information to assist the viewer’, but we feel bound to regard this as irrelevant.",non-argumentative,['sleeve provide information']

"However, although we have thought it proper to dwell at some length with the ‘St Teresa’ aspect, we are of the opinion that in practice, when considering whether or not the video is blasphemous, it makes little or no difference whether one looks upon the central character as being St Teresa or any other nun.",non-argumentative,"['it make difference', 'one look opinion']"

"We should perhaps also deal, albeit briefly, with a further submission made on behalf of the appellant, namely that the crime of blasphemy may extend only to the written or spoken word and hence that a court might rule that no film or video, and perhaps nothing shown on television, could become the subject of such a charge.",non-argumentative,"['we deal submission', 'submission make behalf', 'crime extend word', 'word write word', 'number film become subject', 'video become subject', 'number hing become subject']"

"Indeed the majority took the view that the video’s message was that the nun was moved not by religious ecstasy but rather by sexual ecstasy, this ecstasy being of a perverse kind - full of images of blood, sado-masochism, lesbianism (or perhaps auto-erotism) and bondage.",non-argumentative,"['majority take view', 'nun move ecstasy']"
"Although there was evidence of some element of repressed sexuality in St Teresa’s devotion to Christ, they did not consider that this gave any ground for portraying her as taking the initiative in indulged sexuality.",non-argumentative,"['there be evidence', 'there be St Teresas devotion', 'this give ground', 'ground portray she', 'ground portray initiative', 'ground take initiative', 'ground take sexuality']"
"They considered the over-all tone and spirit of the video to be indecent and had little doubt that all the above factors, coupled with the motions of the nun whilst astride the body of Christ and the response to her kisses and the intertwining of the fingers would outrage the feelings of Christians, who would reasonably look upon it as being contemptuous of the divinity of Christ.",non-argumentative,"['they sidere tone', 'they sidere spirit', 'factother company plead motion', 'response outrage feeling']"

"There appears to be no general uncertainty or disagreement between those appearing before the Court as to the definition in English law of the offence of blasphemy, as formulated by the House of Lords in the case of Whitehouse v. Gay News Ltd and Lemon (see paragraph 27 above).",non-argumentative,"['there appear uncertainty', 'definition formulate case']"
"Having seen for itself the content of the video work, the Court is satisfied that the applicant could reasonably have foreseen with appropriate legal advice that the film, particularly those scenes involving the crucified figure of Christ, could fall within the scope of the offence of blasphemy.",non-argumentative,"['applicant company foresee advice', 'scene involve figure', 'film fall scope']"
"The above conclusion is borne out by the applicant’s decision not to initiate proceedings for judicial review on the basis of counsel’s advice that the Panel’s formulation of the law of blasphemy represented an accurate statement of the law (see, mutatis mutandis, the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 27, para. 60).",non-argumentative,"['company clusion bear applicants decision number', 'applicants decision number initiate proceeding', 'applicants decision number initiate basis', '<ORG> represent statement']"
Against this background it cannot be said that the law in question did not afford the applicant adequate protection against arbitrary interference.,non-argumentative,"['law afford applicant', 'law afford protection']"
"The Court therefore concludes that the impugned restriction was ""prescribed by law"".",non-argumentative,['restriction prescribe law']
Whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim,non-argumentative,['interference pursue aim']
"The Government referred to the case of Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (judgment of 20 September 1994, Series A no. 295-A, pp. 17-18, paras. 47-48) where the Court had accepted that respect for the religious feelings of believers can move a State legitimately to restrict the publication of provocative portrayals of objects of religious veneration.",non-argumentative,"['Government refer case', 'respect move state', 'respect move publication']"
The Commission considered that the English law of blasphemy is intended to suppress behaviour directed against objects of religious veneration that is likely to cause justified indignation amongst believing Christians.,non-argumentative,"['law intend behaviour', 'behaviour direct object', 'behaviour cause indignation']"
It follows that the application of this law in the present case was intended to protect the right of citizens not to be insulted in their religious feelings.,non-argumentative,"['application intend right', 'right insult feeling']"
"The Court notes at the outset that, as stated by the Board, the aim of the interference was to protect against the treatment of a religious subject in such a manner ""as to be calculated (that is, bound, not intended) to outrage those who have an understanding of, sympathy towards and support for the Christian story and ethic, because of the contemptuous, reviling, insulting, scurrilous or ludicrous tone, style and spirit in which the subject is presented"" (see paragraph 15 above).",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> e outset', '<ORG> protect treatment', 'number intend those', 'number outrage those', 'who have understanding', 'number revile tone style', 'number revile spirit', 'number see paragraph']"
"This is an aim which undoubtedly corresponds to that of the protection of ""the rights of others"" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2). It is also fully consonant with the aim of the protections afforded by Article 9 (art. 9) to religious freedom.",non-argumentative,"['aim respond protection', 'protection afford article']"
"In examining whether restrictions to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered ""necessary in a democratic society"" the Court has, however, consistently held that the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation.",non-argumentative,['Contracting States enjoy margin']
"It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction’s compatibility with the Convention and it will do so by assessing in the circumstances of a particular case, inter alia, whether the interference corresponded to a ""pressing social need"" and whether it was ""proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued"" (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Goodwin judgment cited above at paragraph 40, pp. 500-01, para. 40).",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> give ruling', 'it do it', 'interference company respond need', '<NAME> cite paragraph pp']"
"For the Commission, the fact that Visions of Ecstasy was a short video work and not a feature film meant that its distribution would have been more limited and less likely to attract publicity.",non-argumentative,[]
The Commission came to the same conclusion as the applicant.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> come company clusion']
"Whereas there is little scope under Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2) for restrictions on political speech or on debate of questions of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, para. 42; the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, para. 43; and the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, para. 63), a wider margin of appreciation is generally available to the Contracting States when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of morals or, especially, religion.",non-argumentative,"['there be scope', 'there be article para', 'matter offend company viction']"
"Visions of Ecstasy portrays, inter alia, a female character astride the recumbent body of the crucified Christ engaged in an act of an overtly sexual nature (see paragraph 9 above).",non-argumentative,"['vision portray character', 'character engage act']"
"The national authorities, using powers that are not themselves incompatible with the Convention (see paragraph 57 above), considered that the manner in which such imagery was treated placed the focus of the work ""less on the erotic feelings of the character than on those of the audience, which is the primary function of pornography"" (see paragraph 15 above).",non-argumentative,"['authority use power', 'authority see paragraph', 'manner place focus', 'manner place feeling', 'manner place audience']"
"They further held that since no attempt was made in the film to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in a ""voyeuristic erotic experience"", the public distribution of such a video could outrage and insult the feelings of believing Christians and constitute the criminal offence of blasphemy.",non-argumentative,"['number attempt make film', 'meaning engage viewer', 'meaning engage experience']"

"But it is the essence of the national margin of appreciation that, when different opinions are possible and do exist, the international judge should only intervene if the national decision cannot be reasonably justified.",non-argumentative,[]
"I have finally voted with the majority for the following reasons: (1) A prior control and classification of video films is not excluded in this most sensitive area and in view of the dangers involved, especially for young persons and the rights of others.

The first problem considered concerned the British legislation making blasphemy a criminal offence.,non-argumentative,['company cerne legislation']
"To my mind, the law on blasphemy provides a basis for consideration of the case under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and cannot automatically justify a ban on distribution.",non-argumentative,"['law provide basis', 'law provide paragraph']"
Article 9 (art. 9) is not in issue in the instant case and cannot be invoked.,non-argumentative,[]
"Certainly the Court rightly based its analysis under Article 10 (art. 10) on the rights of others and did not, as it had done in the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment combine Articles 9 and 10 (art. 9, art. 10), morals and the rights of others, for which it had been criticised by legal writers.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> base analysis', '<ORG> base article', 'it do number', 'it criticise writer']"
"However, the wording adopted by the Chamber in paragraphs 50 and 53 creates, in my opinion, too direct a link between the law of blasphemy and the criteria justifying a ban or restriction on the distribution of video-cassettes.",non-argumentative,"['wording adopt paragraph', 'wording create link', 'wording create opinion', 'criterion justify ban']"
"The fact that under the legislation on blasphemy, profanation or defamation may give rise to a prosecution does not in itself justify, under Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention, a total ban on the distribution of a book or video.",non-argumentative,"['profanation give rise', 'profanation give prosecution', 'number justify article']"
"In my view, the Court ought to have made that clear.",non-argumentative,[]
There can be no automatic response where freedom of expression is concerned.,non-argumentative,[]

"I consider that the same decision could have been reached under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) on grounds other than blasphemy, for example the profanation of symbols, including secular ones (the national flag) or jeopardising or prejudicing public order (but not for the benefit of a religious majority in the territory concerned).",non-argumentative,"['decision reach paragraph', 'symbol include one', 'profanation jeopardise profanation', 'profanation prejudice order']"
"The reasoning should, in my opinion have been expressed in terms both of religious beliefs and of philosophical convictions.",non-argumentative,['reasoning express term']

What was particularly shocking in the Wingrove case was the combination of an ostensibly philosophical message and wholly irrelevant obscene or pornographic images.,non-argumentative,[]
"In this case, the use of obscenity for commercial ends may justify restrictions under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2); but the use of a figure of symbolic value as a great thinker in the history of mankind (such as Moses, Dante or Tolstoy) in a portrayal which seriously offends the deeply held feelings of those who respect their works or thought may, in some cases, justify judicial supervision so that the public can be alerted through the reporting of court decisions.",non-argumentative,"['use justify restriction', 'which offend feeling', 'who respect work', 'use justify supervision', 'public alert reporting']"
But the possibility of prosecution does not suffice to make a total ban legitimate.,non-argumentative,[]
That question has been raised recently: can a breach of rules of professional conduct (medical confidentiality) in itself justify a total ban on a book? Mr Wingrove’s own argument and the contradictions it contained could even have been used to supplement the Court’s reasoning.,non-argumentative,"['breach justify ban', 'it taine <ORG>', 'argument use <ORG>', 'company tradiction use <ORG>']"
In his application he claimed that intellectual works should be protected against censorship on exclusively moral or religious grounds.,non-argumentative,"['work protect censothership', 'work protect ground']"

"In his submission, they amounted practically to a Voltairean work or one having anti-religious connotations.",non-argumentative,"['they amount work', 'work have notation']"
The film is quite different.,non-argumentative,[]

"Indeed, he acknowledged that as the video stood, it could have been called Gay Nuns in Bondage, like a pornographic film (see the Commission’s report, decision on admissibility, p. 32). The use of the word ""ecstasy"" in the title was a source of ambiguity, as much for people interested in literary works as for those interested in pornography.",non-argumentative,[]
"The sale in hypermarkets and supermarkets of videos inciting pornographic or obscene behaviour is even more dangerous than the sale of books, as it is more difficult to ensure that the public are protected.",non-argumentative,['video incite behaviour']
The recent world-wide conference in Stockholm on the protection of children highlighted the harmful social consequences of distributing millions of copies of obscene or pornographic videos to the public without even minimal checking of their identification marks.,non-argumentative,"['company ference highlight company sequence', 'company sequence distribute million', 'company sequence distribute public', 'company sequence distribute checking']"

"Admittedly, before it was edited, Mr Wingrove’s film was presented as having literary rather than obscene ambitions, but its maker chose not to dispel the ambiguity he had created.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> present ambition', 'maker choose number', 'maker choose ambiguity']"
"Nor did he seek judicial review, as it was open to him to do, of the Video Appeals Committee’s dismissal of his appeal against the Board of Film Classification’s refusal to grant a classification certificate.",non-argumentative,"['he seek review', 'refusal grant classification certificate']"
"It is true that section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984 contains a variety of provisions regulating the grant and use of certificates, ranging from outright bans to restrictions on viewing, identification requirements (in sales centres and on the cover) or measures to protect minors.",non-argumentative,"['section tain variety', 'provision regulate grant', 'provision regulate use', 'provision range ban', 'restriction view identification requirement', 'restriction view sale centre', 'measure protect minother']"
"On this point, British and North American case-law, particularly in Canada, contains a wealth of definitions of the boundaries between literature, obscenity and pornography (see the Revue du Barreau du Québec and the Supreme Court’s case-law review).",non-argumentative,"['case law tain wealth', 'company tain wealth']"
"The majority of the Video Appeals Committee took the view that the imagery led not to a religious perception, but to a perverse one, the ecstasy being furthermore of a perverse kind.",non-argumentative,"['majority take view', 'imagery lead number', 'imagery lead perception']"
"That analysis was in conformity with the approach of the House of Lords, which moreover did not discuss the author’s intention with respect to the moral element of the offence.",non-argumentative,['which discuss authothers intention']

"The rights of others under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) cannot be restricted solely to the protection of the rights of others in a single category of religious believers or philosophers, or a majority of them.",non-argumentative,[]
"The Court was quite right to base its decision on the protection of the rights of others pursuant to Article 10 (art. 10), but to my mind it could have done so on broader grounds, inspired to a greater extent by the concern to protect the context of religious beliefs ""or any other"", as is rightly pointed out in paragraph 53 of the judgment.",non-argumentative,"['it do ground', '<ORG> do ground', 'ground inspire extent', 'ground protect company text', 'ground point paragraph']"
"In the difficult balancing exercise that has to be carried out in these situations where religious and philosophical sensibilities are confronted by freedom of expression, it is important that the inspiration provided by the European Convention and its interpretation should be based both on pluralism and a sense of values.",non-argumentative,"['that have situation', 'balancing exercise carry situation', 'sensibility front freedom', 'inspiration base pluralism', 'inspiration base sense', 'interpretation base pluralism', 'interpretation base sense']"
"It is quite legitimate that those wishing to supply video works be obliged to obtain from some administrative authority a classification certificate stating whether the works concerned may be supplied to the general public or only to persons who have attained a specified age, and whether, in the latter case, they are to be supplied only in certain places .",non-argumentative,"['those oblige classification certificate', 'those oblige authority', 'classification certificate state classification certificate', 'classification certificate state they', 'work supply public', 'who attain age', 'classification certificate supply place']"
"This in itself raises the question whether the interference was ""necessary in a democratic society""",non-argumentative,['this raise question']
The majority has found that in the field of morals the national authorities have a wide margin of appreciation.,non-argumentative,['authority have margin']
"As in that field, ""there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ‘the protection of the rights of others’ in relation to attacks on their religious convictions"" (see paragraph 58 of the judgment).",non-argumentative,['there be company ception']
