"The Government asked the Court to reject the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3) on the ground that, contrary to Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26), he had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him.",conclusion,"['government ask Court', 'government ask applicants company plaint', 'government ask Convention art', 'company trary art', 'he fail remedy']"
"With regard to the first of these options, they submitted that he could have complained about the alleged ill-treatment to the public prosecutor who saw him on 10 December 1992 (see paragraph 18 above).",premise,"['he plain treatment', 'he plain prosecutor', 'who see he']"
"However, according to the Government, Mr Aksoy gave no indication on that occasion or at any time subsequently that he had been ill-treated during his time in police custody.",conclusion,"['<NAME> give number indication', '<NAME> give occasion', 'he treat time']"
"Articles 243 and 245 of the Criminal Code, which were in force throughout Turkey, penalised the use of torture and ill-treatment for the extraction of confessions (see paragraph 24 above).",premise,['article penalise use']
Legislative Decree no. 285 on the state of emergency region transferred the power to carry out investigations into criminal acts allegedly committed by civil servants from the public prosecutors to the administrative councils (see paragraph 26 above).,premise,"['decree number transfer power', 'decree number transfer prosecutother', 'decree number transfer company', 'power carry investigation', 'act mitte servant']"

"Again, they referred to a number of decisions of the domestic courts, including a judgment of the Court of Cassation in a case concerning a claim for damages for torture, where it was held that offences committed by members of the security forces were governed by the Code of Obligations and that, under Article 53 of that Code, an acquittal for lack of evidence in criminal proceedings was not binding on the civil courts.",premise,"['they refer number', 'number include judgment', 'case company cerne claim', 'it hold acquittal', 'company mitte member', 'offence govern acquittal', 'company govern acquittal', 'number bind company rt']"

In this respect he referred to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s Public Statement on Turkey (15 December 1992); the United Nations Committee against Torture’s Summary Account of the Results of the Proceedings Concerning the Inquiry on Turkey (9 November 1993); and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture’s Report of 1995,premise,"['he refer number ember', 'number ember concern Inquiry']"
"While the applicant did not deny that the remedies identified by the Government were formally part of the Turkish legal system, he claimed that, in the region under emergency rule, they were illusory, inadequate and ineffective because both torture and the denial of effective remedies were carried out as a matter of administrative practice.",conclusion,"['torture carry matter', 'denial carry matter']"
"Furthermore, lawyers and others who acted for the victims of human rights violations were subjected to threats, intimidation and abusive prosecutions and individuals were afraid to pursue domestic remedies because reprisals against complainants were so common.",premise,"['who act victim', 'lawyer subject threat intimidation', 'lawyer subject prosecution', 'other subject threat intimidation', 'other subject prosecution']"
"In these circumstances, the applicant claimed that he should not be required to pursue domestic remedies before making a complaint to Strasbourg.",premise,"['he require remedy', 'he require company plaint']"
"While the applicant did not deny that the remedies identified by the Government were formally part of the Turkish legal system, he claimed that, in the region under emergency rule, they were illusory, inadequate and ineffective because both torture and the denial of effective remedies were carried out as a matter of administrative practice.",conclusion,"['torture carry matter', 'denial carry matter']"
"In any case, he maintained that he had informed the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992 that he had been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and asserted that, even if he had not, the prosecutor could plainly have observed that he did not have the proper use of his hands.",premise,"['he inform prosecutor', 'he have use']"
The failure of the prosecutor to start a criminal investigation made it extremely difficult for the applicant to avail himself of any domestic remedy.,premise,"['failure start investigation', 'applicant avail himself', 'applicant avail remedy']"
"While the applicant did not deny that the remedies identified by the Government were formally part of the Turkish legal system, he claimed that, in the region under emergency rule, they were illusory, inadequate and ineffective because both torture and the denial of effective remedies were carried out as a matter of administrative practice.",conclusion,"['torture carry matter', 'denial carry matter']"
"It followed that, although it was not possible to establish exactly what happened during his meeting with the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992, there must undoubtedly have been elements which should have prompted the latter to open an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information about the applicant’s state of health and the treatment to which he had been subjected.",premise,"['it follow element', 'what happen meeting', 'which prompt latter', 'which prompt investigation', 'element open investigation', 'element try information', 'element obtain information']"

"In addition, this failure prejudiced his chances of victory in civil or administrative proceedings, because in order to succeed with either type of claim it would have been necessary to prove that he had suffered torture, and in practice a ruling to that effect by a judge in criminal proceedings would have been required.",premise,"['failure prejudice chance', 'order succeed type', 'he suffer torture']"
"Finally, he reminded the Court that no remedy was available even in theory in relation to his complaint regarding the length of time he was detained without judicial control, since this was perfectly lawful under the domestic legislation (see paragraph 29 above).",premise,"['he remind <ORG>', 'company plaint regard length', 'he detain company trol']"
The Commission was of the opinion that the applicant had been injured during his time in police custody (see paragraph 23 above).,premise,['applicant injure time']

"Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems.",premise,"['they have opportunity', 'opportunity put matter', 'opportunity put system']"
"Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism.",premise,['it recognise article art']
"These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State.",premise,"['circumstance give he', 'circumstance give cause', 'cause feel cause']"
"In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65).",premise,"['system safeguard right', 'judgment cite paragraph']"
The Court therefore concludes that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from his obligation to exhaust domestic remedies.,conclusion,"['there exist circumstance', 'which absolve applicant', 'which absolve obligation', 'obligation exhaust remedy']"
The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system.,premise,"['rule refer Convention art', 'remedy provide system']"
"Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems.",conclusion,"['they have opportunity', 'opportunity put matter', 'opportunity put system']"
"The Court considers that, even if it were accepted that the applicant made no complaint to the public prosecutor of ill-treatment in police custody, the injuries he had sustained must have been clearly visible during their meeting.",premise,"['applicant make number company plaint', 'applicant make prosecutor']"
"However, the prosecutor chose to make no enquiry as to the nature, extent and cause of these injuries, despite the fact that in Turkish law he was under a duty to investigate (see paragraph 26 above).",premise,['prosecutor choose number enquiry']
It must be recalled that this omission on the part of the prosecutor took place after Mr Aksoy had been detained in police custody for at least fourteen days without access to legal or medical assistance or support.,premise,"['it recall assistance', 'omission take place', '<NAME> detain police custody', '<NAME> detain day', '<NAME> detain access']"
During this time he had sustained severe injuries requiring hospital treatment (see paragraph 23 above).,premise,"['he sustain injury', 'injury require hospital treatment']"
"These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State.",conclusion,"['circumstance give he', 'circumstance give cause', 'cause feel cause']"
"These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State.",premise,"['circumstance give he', 'circumstance give cause', 'cause feel cause']"
The Court therefore concludes that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from his obligation to exhaust domestic remedies.,conclusion,"['there exist circumstance', 'which absolve applicant', 'which absolve obligation', 'obligation exhaust remedy']"
"For example, they questioned why the applicant had made no complaint to the public prosecutor about having been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and found it difficult to understand why, if he had indeed been subjected to torture, he had not made any inculpatory confession.",premise,"['applicant make number company plaint', 'applicant make prosecutor', 'he subject torture', 'he make company fession']"
They also found it suspicious that he had waited for five days between being released from police custody and contacting the hospital (see paragraph 19 above) and observed that it could not be assumed that nothing untoward had occurred in the meantime.,premise,"['he wait day', 'he wait police custody', 'number he occur meantime']"
"Finally, they raised a number of points relating to the medical evidence, including the facts that the applicant took his medical records with him when he left hospital and that there was no medical evidence of burns or other marks left by the application of electric shocks.",premise,"['they raise number', 'point relate evidence', 'number include fact', 'applicant take record', 'he leave hospital', 'there be evidence', 'mark leave application']"
"They pointed to a number of factors which, in their view, should have given rise to serious doubt as to whether Mr Aksoy had been ill-treated as he claimed.",conclusion,"['they point number', 'which give rise', 'which give doubt']"
"The Court considers, in the light of all the material before it, that the particular extent and impact of PKK terrorist activity in South-East Turkey has undoubtedly created, in the region concerned, a ""public emergency threatening the life of the nation""",premise,"['<ORG> sider light', 'extent create region', 'impact create region', 'emergency threaten life']"
"It clearly follows that the period of fourteen or more days during which Mr Aksoy was detained without being brought before a judge or other judicial officer did not satisfy the requirement of ""promptness"".",premise,"['<NAME> detain judge', 'day bring judge', 'period satisfy requirement']"
"Although the Court is of the view - which it has expressed on several occasions in the past (see, for example, the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment) - that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, it cannot accept that it is necessary to hold a suspect for fourteen days without judicial intervention. This period is exceptionally long, and left the applicant vulnerable not only to arbitrary interference with his right to liberty but also to torture (see paragraph 64 above). Moreover, the Government have not adduced any detailed reasons before the Court as to why the fight against terrorism in South-East Turkey rendered judicial intervention impracticable.",premise,"['it express occasion', 'view see judgment', 'view see example', 'investigation present authority', 'investigation present problem', 'Government adduce reason']"

"The Court recalls its decision in the case of Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 B, p. 33, para. 62), that a period of detention without judicial control of four days and six hours fell outside the strict constraints as to time permitted by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3).",premise,"['Court recall decision', 'period fall company straint', 'time permit article para']"
"It clearly follows that the period of fourteen or more days during which Mr Aksoy was detained without being brought before a judge or other judicial officer did not satisfy the requirement of ""promptness"".",conclusion,"['<NAME> detain judge', 'day bring judge', 'period satisfy requirement']"
"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the pressing needs of the moment, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide both on the presence of such an emergency and on the nature and scope of the derogations necessary to avert it.",premise,"['authority place judge', 'authority place presence', 'derogation avert it']"
"Accordingly, in this matter a wide margin of appreciation should be left to the national authorities.",conclusion,['margin leave authority']

"It is for the Court to rule whether, inter alia, the States have gone beyond the ""extent strictly required by the exigencies"" of the crisis.",premise,"['States go extent', 'extent require exigency']"

"In the Brannigan and McBride judgment (cited at paragraph 68 above), the Court held that the United Kingdom Government had not exceeded their margin of appreciation by derogating from their obligations under Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) to the extent that individuals suspected of terrorist offences were allowed to be held for up to seven days without judicial control.",premise,"['judgment cite paragraph', '<ORG> exceed margin', 'individual suspect offence', 'individual allow day', 'individual allow company trol', 'extent hold day', 'extent hold company trol']"

"As Judge Gotchev rightly noted in his dissenting opinion in the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others case, in connection with the exhaustion-of-domestic-remedies rule, in order to reach such a conclusion after the respondent Government have demonstrated the existence of domestic remedies, the burden of proof should fall (once more) on the applicant, who should be required to prove that the authorities in that region of the country frustrated his attempts to set the appropriate proceedings in motion.",conclusion,"['respondent government demonstrate existence', 'burden fall applicant', 'authority frustrate attempt', 'attempt set proceeding', 'attempt set motion']"

"Article 3 (art. 3), as the Court has observed on many occasions, enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society.",conclusion,['<ORG> observe occasion']
"The Court recalls that the Commission found, inter alia, that the applicant was subjected to ""Palestinian hanging"", in other words, that he was stripped naked, with his arms tied together behind his back, and suspended by his arms (see paragraph 23 above).

"This derogation was necessary and justified, in view of the extent and gravity of PKK terrorism in Turkey, particularly in the South East.",non-argumentative,[]

A great deal of time and effort was required to secure and verify evidence in a large region confronted with a terrorist organisation that had strategic and technical support from neighbouring countries.,non-argumentative,"['region company front organisation', 'that have support']"
These difficulties meant that it was impossible to provide judicial supervision during a suspect’s detention in police custody.,non-argumentative,[]
The applicant submitted that he was detained on 24 November 1992 and released on 10 December 1992.,non-argumentative,[]
He alleged that the post-dating of arrests was a common practice in the state of emergency region.,non-argumentative,[]

"The Commission could not establish with any certainty whether the applicant was first detained on 24 November 1992, as he claimed, or on 26 November 1992, as alleged by the Government, and it therefore proceeded on the basis that he was held for at least fourteen days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> establish certainty', 'applicant detain it', 'it proceed basis', 'he hold day', 'basis bring judge', 'judge authorise law', 'judge authorise power', 'judge exercise power']"

The Government emphasised that both the derogation and the national legal system provided sufficient safeguards to protect human rights.,non-argumentative,"['derogation provide safeguard', 'system provide safeguard', 'safeguard protect right']"

"In these circumstances, despite the serious terrorist threat in South-East Turkey, the measure which allowed the applicant to be detained for at least fourteen days without being brought before a judge or other officer exercising judicial functions exceeded the Government’s margin of appreciation and could not be said to be strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.",non-argumentative,"['which allow judge', 'applicant detain day', 'measure bring judge', 'officer exercise function', 'measure exceed governments margin', 'company ld number say exigency']"

"For example, the remedy of habeas corpus was available to test the lawfulness of the original arrest and detention, there was an absolute and legally enforceable right to consult a solicitor forty-eight hours after the time of arrest and detainees were entitled to inform a relative or friend about their detention and to have access to a doctor (op. cit., pp. 55-56, paras. 62-63).",non-argumentative,"['remedy test lawfulness', 'remedy be right', 'there be right', 'right sult solicitor', 'detainee entitle relative', 'detainee entitle detention']"

"In addition, he stated that the ability to seek compensation for torture would represent only one part of the measures necessary to provide redress; it would be unacceptable for a State to claim that it fulfilled its obligation simply by providing compensation, since this would in effect be to allow States to pay for the right to torture.",non-argumentative,"['ability seek company pensation', 'ability represent part', 'measure provide redress', 'it fulfil obligation', 'it fulfil company pensation', 'state pay right']"

"The effect of this Article (art. 13) is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (art. 13) (see the Chahal judgment cited at paragraph 62 above, pp. 1869-70, para. 145).",non-argumentative,"['remedy allow remedy', 'authority deal substance', 'remedy grant relief', 'Contracting States afford discretion', 'company form obligation', '<NAME> cite paragraph']"

"The Court would first make it clear that its finding (in paragraph 57 above) that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from his obligation to exhaust domestic remedies should not be taken as meaning that remedies are ineffective in South-East Turkey (see, mutatis mutandis, the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, pp. 1213-14, para. 77).",non-argumentative,"['there exist circumstance', 'which absolve applicant', 'which absolve obligation', 'obligation exhaust remedy', 'judgment cite pp']"
"Secondly, the Court, like the Commission, would take judicial notice of the fact that allegations of torture in police custody are extremely difficult for the victim to substantiate if he has been isolated from the outside world, without access to doctors, lawyers, family or friends who could provide support and assemble the necessary evidence.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> take number ice', '<ORG> take fact', 'he isolate world', 'he isolate access', 'who provide support', 'doctothers lawyers family assemble evidence']"
"Furthermore, having been ill-treated in this way, an individual will often have had his capacity or will to pursue a complaint impaired.",non-argumentative,"['individual have capacity', 'capacity pursue company']"
"Accordingly, as regards Article 13 (art. 13), where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been tortured by agents of the State, the notion of an ""effective remedy"" entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure.",non-argumentative,"['individual have claim', 'he torture agent', 'number ion entail investigation', 'number ion entail addition', 'investigation lead identification', 'investigation lead punishment', 'investigation include access']"

"No evidence has been adduced before the Court to show that any other action was taken, despite the prosecutor’s awareness of the applicant’s injuries.",non-argumentative,['evidence adduce court']
"Moreover, in the Court’s view, in the circumstances of Mr Aksoy’s case, such an attitude from a State official under a duty to investigate criminal offences was tantamount to undermining the effectiveness of any other remedies that may have existed.",non-argumentative,['duty investigate offence']

"Finally, since the domestic law permitted suspects to be detained for long periods in violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), this was evidence of an administrative practice of breaching that provision (art. 5-3).",non-argumentative,"['suspect detain period', 'suspect detain violation', 'practice breach provision art']"
"The Court is of the view that the evidence established by the Commission is insufficient to allow it to reach a conclusion concerning the existence of any administrative practice of the violation of the above Articles of the Convention (art. 3, art. 5-3, art. 6-1, art. 13, art. 25-1).",non-argumentative,"['it reach company clusion company', 'company clusion company cerne existence']"

In the present case the Court had to rule firstly on a preliminary objection that domestic remedies had not been exhausted.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> have objection']
It is clear from the reasoning on this in paragraphs 51 to 57 of the judgment that in the applicant’s case these remedies were purely theoretical.,non-argumentative,[]
"This suggests a violation of Article 13 (art. 13), as is later made explicit in different terms in paragraphs 95 to 100 of the judgment.",non-argumentative,['this suggest violation']

Turkey (see the judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV).",non-argumentative,['I refer opinion']
I would point out that Article 17 of the Turkish Constitution is a literal translation of Article 3 (art. 3) of the European Convention on Human Rights and that torture and ill-treatment attract heavy penalties under the Turkish Criminal Code (Articles 243 and 245) (criminal remedy).,non-argumentative,"['torture attract penalty', 'treatment attract penalty']"

"The Court, on the basis of this unclarified question of fact, namely the alleged failure of the prosecuting authorities to set criminal proceedings in motion, concluded that the criminal remedy was ineffective.",non-argumentative,"['failure set proceeding', 'failure set motion']"

"For that reason alone, the applicant’s complaints should first be brought before the Turkish courts so that it can be established whether domestic remedies are effective or not.",non-argumentative,['applicants company plaint bring company rt']
