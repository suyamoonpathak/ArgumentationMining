"As has been noted in several previous judgments by the Court, the campaign of terrorism waged in Northern Ireland over the last quarter of a century has taken a terrible toll, especially in terms of human life and suffering (see paragraph 35 above).",premise,"['campaign wage number', 'campaign wage quarter', 'campaign take toll', 'campaign take term']"
The Court sees no reason to depart from the general approach it has adopted in previous cases of a similar nature.,premise,"['Court see number reason', 'number reason depart approach', 'it adopt case']"
"(see, inter alia, the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 15, para. 28, citing the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 27, para. 48).",premise,[]
"Accordingly, for the purposes of interpreting and applying the relevant provisions of the Convention, due account will be taken of the special nature of terrorist crime, the threat it poses to democratic society and the exigencies of dealing with it",conclusion,"['purpose interpret purpose', 'purpose apply provision']"
"They also pointed to a number of other facts capable of supporting, albeit indirectly, the reasonableness of the suspicion, including notably the findings made by the domestic courts in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, the very recent conviction of her brothers in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her own visits to the USA and her contacts with her brothers there (see especially paragraphs 10, 19, 24, 25, 28 and 29 above).",premise,"['they point number', 'fact support reasonableness', 'fact include finding', 'finding make company', 'finding make proceeding', 'visit see paragraph', 'company tact see paragraph']"

"Any other conclusion by the Court would, they feared, prohibit arresting authorities from effecting an arrest of a person suspected of being a terrorist based primarily on reliable but secret information and would inhibit the arresting authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism.",premise,"['company clusion prohibit authority', 'company clusion prohibit arrest', 'person suspect terrorist']"
They submitted that all these matters taken together provided sufficient facts and information to satisfy an objective observer that there was a reasonable suspicion in the circumstances of the cas,conclusion,"['they submit fact', 'matter provide fact', 'matter provide information', 'fact satisfy observer', 'there be suspicion']"
"As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention.",premise,"['governments explanation meet standard', 'number meet standard', 'standard set article para']"
She did not accept that the reason advanced for non-disclosure was a genuine or valid one.,premise,[]
She in her turn pointed to circumstances said to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the suspicion.,premise,"['she point circumstance', 'circumstance say doubt', 'circumstance say reasonableness', 'circumstance cast doubt', 'circumstance cast reasonableness']"
"In reply to the Government the first applicant contended that the issue which the domestic courts inquired into was not the objective reasonableness of any suspicion but the subjective state of mind of the arresting officer, Corporal D. 54. For the Commission, the Government’s explanation in the present case was not materially distinguishable from that provided in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley.",premise,"['applicant company tend reasonableness', 'number provide case']"
It took the view that no objective evidence to corroborate the unrevealed information had been adduced in support of the suspicion that the first applicant had been involved in collecting money for Provisional IRA arms purchases other than her kinship with her convicted brothers.,premise,"['it take view', 'evidence roborate information', 'evidence adduce support', 'applicant involve money']"
"The first applicant, on the other hand, considered that the Government had failed to discharge the onus of disclosing sufficient facts to enable the Convention institutions to conclude that the suspicion grounding her arrest was reasonable or anything more than the ""honest"" suspicion required under Northern Ireland law.",conclusion,"['government fail onus', 'onus disclose fact', 'fact enable Convention institution', 'suspicion ground arrest', 'suspicion require thern Ireland law']"
"With regard to the level of ""suspicion"", the Court would note firstly that, as was observed in its judgment in the case of Brogan and Others, ""sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) does not presuppose that the [investigating authorities] should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while [the arrested person is] in custody.",premise,"['<ORG> number case', 'number presuppose person', 'authority obtain evidence', 'evidence bring charge', 'evidence bring point', 'evidence bring custody']"
"Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others"" (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 53).",premise,"['nature produce life', 'nature endanger life']"
The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest.,premise,"['company firm way', 'way dispel suspicion', 'suspicion ground arrest']"
"Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation.",conclusion,"['which raise suspicion', 'level justify company viction']"
"Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation.",premise,"['which raise suspicion', 'level justify company viction']"
The length of the deprivation of liberty at risk may also be material to the level of suspicion required.,premise,[]
"The period of detention permitted under the provision by virtue of which Mrs Murray was arrested, namely section 14 of the 1978 Act, was limited to a maximum of four hours.",conclusion,"['period permit provision', 'period limit maximum']"
"With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts.",premise,"['principle state judgment', 'existence depend fact']"
The Court would firstly reiterate its recognition that the use of confidential information is essential in combating terrorist violence and the threat that organised terrorism poses to the lives of citizens and to democratic society as a whole,conclusion,"['Court reiterate recognition', 'terrorism pose life']"

"(see also the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 48).",premise,[]
"This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 (art. 5) to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts or by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (ibid., p. 23, para. 49).",premise,"['authority have blanche', 'authority have article art']"
"As to the present case, the terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland, the carnage it has caused over the years and the active engagement of the Provisional IRA in that campaign are established beyond doubt.",premise,"['it cause year', 'as establish doubt']"
The Court also accepts that the power of arrest granted to the Army by section 14 of the 1978 Act represented a bona fide attempt by a democratically elected parliament to deal with terrorist crime under the rule of law.,premise,"['power grant to', 'power grant section', 'power represent attempt', 'attempt deal crime', 'attempt deal rule']"
"That finding is not altered by the fact that the terms of the applicable legislation were amended in 1987 as a result of the Baker Report so as to include a requirement that the arrest should be based on reasonable, rather than merely honest, suspicion (see paragraph 37 above).",premise,"['finding alter fact', 'term amend result', 'fact include requirement', 'arrest base suspicion']"
The Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.,conclusion,"['Court prepare credence', 'Court prepare <ORG>', '<ORG> cerne existence', 'information ground suspicion']"
The Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.,premise,"['Court prepare credence', 'Court prepare <ORG>', '<ORG> cerne existence', 'information ground suspicion']"
"Nevertheless, in the words of the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, the respondent Government must in addition ""furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (see paragraph 51 above).",premise,"['government furnish fact', 'fact satisfy Court', 'person suspect offence', 'fact mitte offence']"
"In this connection, unlike in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Convention institutions have had the benefit of the review that the national courts conducted of the facts and of Mrs Murray’s allegations in the civil proceedings brought by her.",premise,['<ORG> have benefit']
"It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was ""reasonable"" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.",premise,"['evidence adduce company', 'evidence adduce rt']"
At the very least the honesty and bona fides of a suspicion constitute one indispensable element of its reasonableness.,premise,"['honesty stitute element', 'bona fide stitute element']"
"In the action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts, the High Court judge, after having heard the witnesses and assessed their credibility, found that she had genuinely been suspected of having been involved in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms in the USA for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 24 above).",premise,"['action bring imprisonment', 'action bring tort', '<ORG> hear witness']"
"The judge believed the evidence of the arresting officer, Corporal D, who was described as a ""transparently honest witness"", as to what she had been told at her briefing before the arrest (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above).",premise,"['judge believe evidence', 'who describe witness', 'she tell briefing']"
"Likewise as found by the judge, although the interview at the Army centre was later in time than the arrest, the line of questioning pursued by the interviewer also tends to support the conclusion that Mrs Murray herself was suspected of the commission of a specific criminal offence (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above).",premise,"['line pursue interviewer', 'line tend company clusion', '<NAME> suspect company mission']"
Some weeks before her arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had been convicted in the USA of offences connected with purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).,premise,"['two victe offence', 'two victe purchase']"
"As she disclosed in her evidence to the High Court, she had visited the USA and had contacts with her brothers there (see paragraph 19 above).",premise,"['she disclose evidence', 'she visit USA']"
"The offences of which her brothers were convicted were ones that implied collaboration with ""trustworthy"" persons residing in Northern Ireland.",premise,"['that imply company laboration', 'person reside number']"
"Having regard to the level of factual justification required at the stage of suspicion and to the special exigencies of investigating terrorist crime, the Court finds, in the light of all the above considerations, that there did exist sufficient facts or information which would provide a plausible and objective basis for a suspicion that Mrs Murray may have committed the offence of involvement in the collection of funds for the Provisional IRA.",conclusion,"['level require stage', 'exigency investigate crime', 'Court find light', 'there exist fact', 'which provide basis', '<NAME> mitte offence']"

"On the particular facts of the present case, therefore, the Court is satisfied that, notwithstanding the lower standard of suspicion under domestic law, Mrs Murray can be said to have been arrested and detained on ""reasonable suspicion"" of the commission of a criminal offence, within the meaning of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c).",conclusion,[]
"She referred to the entries made in her regard on the standard record form completed at the Army centre (see paragraph 15 above), to the failure of the Army to involve the police in her questioning and to the short (one-hour) period of her questioning (see paragraph 14 above).",premise,"['she refer entry', 'she refer failure', 'entry make regard', 'entry make record form', 'company plete <ORG>', 'failure involve police', 'failure involve questioning']"
"In the first applicant’s submission, it was clear from the surrounding circumstances that she was not arrested for the purpose of bringing her before a ""competent legal authority"" but merely for the purpose of interrogating her with a view to gathering general intelligence.",conclusion,"['she arrest purpose', 'purpose bring she', 'purpose bring authority', 'purpose interrogate she', 'purpose interrogate view', 'view gather intelligence']"

Germany judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, para. 29, in relation to Article 3 (art. 3)).",premise,[]
In the present case no cogent elements have been produced by the first applicant in the proceedings before the Convention institutions which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact made by the Northern Ireland courts.,premise,"['number ent element produce applicant', 'number ent element produce proceeding', 'company ld lead Court']"
Mrs Murray was neither charged nor brought before a court but was released after an interview lasting a little longer than one hour (see paragraph 14 above).,premise,[]
"This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since ""the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement"" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53).",premise,[]
"As the domestic courts pointed out (see paragraphs 25 in fine, 29 in fine and 34 in fine above), in view of her persistent refusal to answer any questions at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 19 above) it is not surprising that the authorities were not able to make any headway in pursuing the suspicions against her.",premise,"['refusal answer question', 'refusal answer <ORG>', 'headway pursue suspicion']"
"It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority.",conclusion,"['it assume she', 'charge lay she', 'she bring authority']"
"It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority.",premise,"['it assume she', 'charge lay she', 'she bring authority']"
What counts for the purpose of compliance with Convention obligations is the substance rather than the form.,premise,['company nt purpose']
"Provided that the purpose of the arrest and detention is genuinely to bring the person before the competent legal authority, the mechanics of how this is to be achieved will not be decisive.",premise,[]
The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).,conclusion,"['arrest take purpose', 'detention take purpose', 'purpose specify paragraph art']"
The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).,premise,"['arrest take purpose', 'detention take purpose', 'purpose specify paragraph art']"
"In conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in respect of the first applicant.",conclusion,[]

"""Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.""",premise,"['everyone inform language', 'everyone inform reason']"
"Although she had realised that the Army was interested in her brothers’ activities, she had not, she claimed, understood from the interview at the Army centre that she herself was suspected of involvement in fund-raising for the Provisional IRA.",premise,"['she have number', 'she suspect involvement']"
The only direct information she was given was the formal formula of arrest pronounced by Corporal D. 74. The Commission similarly took the view that it was impossible to draw any conclusions from what it described as the vague indications given by Corporal D. in evidence before the High Court as to whether the first applicant had been able to understand from the interview why she had been arrested.,premise,"['Commission take view', 'view draw company clusion', 'it describe indication', 'indication give evidence', 'indication understand interview']"
The first applicant maintained that at no time during her arrest or detention had she been given any or sufficient information as to the grounds of her arrest.,conclusion,['she give information']
"According to the Government, on the other hand, it was apparent from the trial evidence",premise,[]
that in the interview it was made clear to Mrs Murray that she was suspected of the offence of collecting money for the Provisional IRA.,conclusion,"['it make clear', 'she suspect offence']"
"since she had been released rapidly, before any determination of the lawfulness of her detention could have taken place.",premise,['determination take place']
"In the alternative, even if insufficient information had been given to her to avail herself of her right under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention to take legal proceedings to test the lawfulness of her detention, she had suffered no prejudice thereby which would give rise to a breach of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2)",conclusion,"['information give to', '<ORG> take proceeding', 'proceeding test lawfulness', 'she suffer number prejudice', 'which give rise', 'which give breach']"
"It is common ground that, apart from repeating the formal words of arrest required by law, the arresting officer, Corporal D., also told Mrs Murray the section of the 1978 Act under which the arrest was being carried out (see paragraphs 12 and 36 above).",premise,"['word require law', 'officer tell <NAME>', 'officer tell section']"
"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41).",premise,[]
"During the trial of Mrs Murray’s action against the Ministry of Defence, evidence as to the interview at the Army centre was given by Mrs Murray and Corporal D., but not by the soldier who had conducted the interview (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 21 above).",premise,['who ducte interview']
Mrs Murray testified that she had been questioned about her brothers in the USA and about her contacts with them but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence (see paragraph 19 above).,premise,['she question brother']
Corporal D. did not have a precise recollection as to the content of the questions put to Mrs Murray.,premise,"['Corporal have recollection', 'number have recollection', 'question put to']"
"This is not perhaps surprising since the trial took place over three years after the events - Mrs Murray having waited eighteen months before bringing her action - and Corporal D., although present, had not taken an active part in the interview (see paragraphs 14, 16, 17 and 21 above).",premise,"['trial take place', 'trial take event', '<NAME> wait action', 'number take part', 'number take interview']"
"Corporal D. did however remember that questions had been asked about money and about America and the trial judge found her to be a ""transparently honest witness"" (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above).",premise,"['<NAME> remember trial judge', 'question ask money']"
"Shortly before the arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had, presumably to the knowledge of all concerned in the interview, been convicted in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).",premise,"['two cerne interview', 'offence necte purchase']"
They considered it established that Mrs Murray had been given sufficient information as to the grounds of her arrest.,conclusion,['<NAME> give information']
"In the Court’s view, it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA.",premise,['she question involvement']
"Admittedly, ""there was never any probing examination of her collecting money"" - to use the words of the trial judge - but, as the national courts noted, this was because of Mrs Murray’s declining to answer any questions at all beyond giving her name (see paragraphs 14, 23, 25, 29 and 34 in fine above).",premise,"['there be examination', '<NAME> decline question', 'question give name']"
The Court therefore finds that the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview.,conclusion,"['reason bring attention', 'reason bring interview']"
Mrs Murray was arrested at her home at 7 a.m. and interviewed at the Army centre between 8.20 a.m. and 9.35 a.m. on the same day (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).,premise,"['<NAME> arrest home', '<NAME> arrest a.m.']"
In the context of the present case this interval cannot be regarded as falling outside the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness in Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).,conclusion,"['time impose number ion', 'time impose article para']"

"They disputed that the impugned measures all formed an integral part of Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention or that the domestic courts had affirmed their lawfulness, in particular as concerns the retention of the records including the photograph of Mrs Murray.",premise,"['they dispute <NAME>', 'they dispute <ORG>', 'measure form part', '<ORG> affirm lawfulness', 'record include photograph']"
"On the other hand, the applicants did not concede that the resultant interferences had been ""in accordance with the law""",conclusion,[]
Entry into and search of a home by Army personnel such as occurred in the present case were explicitly permitted by section 14 (3) of the 1978 Act for the purpose of effecting arrests under that section (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) above).,premise,"['entry occur case', 'entry permit section', 'search permit section', 'purpose effect arrest', 'purpose effect section']"
The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).,premise,"['<ORG> uphold legality', '<ORG> uphold case']"
The short period of restraint endured by the other members of Mrs Murray’s family when they were asked to assemble in one room was held by the House of Lords to be a necessary and proper part of the procedure of arrest of Mrs Murray (see paragraph 33 above).,premise,"['period endure member', 'they ask room', 'period assemble room']"
"The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords also confirmed that the Army’s implied lawful authority under section 14 extended to interrogating a detained person and to recording personal details of the kind contained in the standard record form (see paragraph 41 above and also paragraphs 15, 30 and 34).",premise,"['<ORG> firm section', '<ORG> firm paragraph', '<ORG> imply authority', '<ORG> imply paragraph', '<ORG> imply paragraph', 'section extend person', 'section interrogate person', 'section record detail', 'company taine record form']"
It is implicit in the judgments of the national courts that the retention of such details was covered by the same lawful authority derived from section 14 (see paragraph 41 in fine above).,premise,"['retention ere authority', 'authority derive section', 'section see paragraph']"
"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above).",conclusion,"['taking have basis', 'retention have basis']"
"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above).",premise,"['taking have basis', 'retention have basis']"

"It remains to be determined whether they were necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",premise,['it remain mean']
In this connection it is not for the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities its own assessment of what might be the best policy in the field of investigation of terrorist crime,premise,"['Court substitute assessment', 'Court substitute assessment']"
A certain margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take both in general and in particular cases should be left to the national authorities.,premise,"['margin decide margin', 'margin take margin', 'margin leave authority']"
"The present judgment has already adverted to the responsibility of an elected government in a democratic society to protect its citizens and its institutions against the threats posed by organised terrorism and to the special problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences (see paragraphs 47, 51 and 58 above).",premise,"['judgment advert responsibility', 'responsibility protect citizen', 'responsibility protect threat', 'responsibility protect institution', 'threat pose terrorism', 'problem involve arrest', 'problem involve detention', 'person suspect offence']"
These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes,premise,"['factother affect balance', 'right guarantee to', 'right guarantee paragraph', '<ORG> take measure']"
The domestic courts held that Mrs Murray was genuinely and honestly suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above).,premise,['<NAME> suspect company mission']
"The European Court, for its part, has found on the evidence before it that this suspicion could be regarded as reasonable for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 63 above).",premise,"['<ORG> find evidence', 'suspicion company regard purpose', 'ld regard purpose']"

"Furthermore, the ""conditions of extreme tension"", as Lord Griffiths put it in his speech in the House of Lords, under which such arrests in Northern Ireland have to be carried out must be recognised.",premise,"['<NAME> put it', '<NAME> put speech']"
"The Court notes the analysis of Lord Griffiths, when he said (see paragraph 33 above): ""The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I ... regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. ...

Neither can it be regarded as falling outside the legitimate bounds of the process of investigation of terrorist crime for the competent authorities to record and retain basic personal details concerning the arrested person or even other persons present at the time and place of arrest.,premise,[]
None of the personal details taken during the search of the family home or during Mrs Murray’s stay at the Army centre would appear to have been irrelevant to the procedures of arrest and interrogation (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above).,premise,"['detail take search', 'none none appear arrest']"

"The Court discerns no reason, on the material before it, for not concluding that each of the various measures was ""in accordance with the law"", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).",premise,"['Court discern number reason', 'Court discern material']"
These measures undoubtedly pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.,premise,['measure pursue aim']
"In the light of the particular facts of the case, the Court finds that the various measures complained of can be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).",premise,['measure regard meaning']
In conclusion there has been no violation of Article 8 (art. 8) in respect of any of the applicants.,conclusion,[]
"(see the Brannigan and McBride v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258-B, p. 57, para. 76), which provides:",premise,[]
"Under the Convention scheme of protection of the right to liberty and security of person, the lex specialis as regards entitlement to a remedy is paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4)",conclusion,['specialis regard entitlement']
"notably in the Brogan and Others and Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgments (loc. cit., pp. 34-35, para. 65, and pp. 20-21, para. 45, respectively).",premise,[]
"The scope of this specific entitlement in relation to arrest and detention under the emergency legislation in Northern Ireland has been considered by the Court,",conclusion,[]
"Under the Convention scheme of protection of the right to liberty and security of person, the lex specialis as regards entitlement to a remedy is paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4)",premise,['specialis regard entitlement']
"""Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.""",premise,"['who deprive liberty', 'who deprive arrest', 'everyone entitle proceeding', 'lawfulness decide release']"
No complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions.,premise,"['company plaint make applicant', 'company plaint make article para']"
"The Court sees no cause, either on the facts or in law, to examine whether the less strict requirements of Article 13 (art. 13) were complied with in the present case.",conclusion,"['Court see number cause', 'Court see fact']"
since such domestic proceedings as might have been taken in relation to entry and search would have failed because domestic law provided lawful excuse for those actions.,premise,"['proceeding take relation', 'law provide excuse']"
The first applicant argued that effective remedies for her claims under Article 8 (art. 8) regarding the Army’s actions in entering and searching her house were lacking,conclusion,"['<NAME> enter <NAME>', '<NAME> search house']"
Article 13 (art. 13) guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order.,premise,"['availability enforce substance', 'they happen order', 'availability secure order']"
"Its effect is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent ""national authority"" both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief in meritorious cases (see, inter alia, the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 39, para. 122, and the authorities cited there).",premise,"['remedy allow remedy', '<ORG> deal substance', 'remedy grant relief', 'remedy grant case']"
The remedy available to Mrs Murray would have satisfied these conditions.,premise,['remedy satisfy company dition']
"As the Commission pointed out, her feeble prospects of success in the light of the particular circumstances of her case do not detract from the ""effectiveness"" of the remedy for the purpose of Article 13 (art. 13) (ibid.).",conclusion,['prospect detract effectiveness']
Whether the relevant domestic law as applied to Mrs Murray ensured her a sufficient level of protection of her right to respect for her private life is a substantive issue under Article 8 (art. 8).,premise,"['law ensure she', 'law ensure level']"
The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above).,premise,"['matter plain article', 'nection find judgment']"
Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority,premise,"['she challenge company tent', 'she challenge authority']"
The facts of the present case do not therefore disclose a violation of Article 13 (art. 13) in respect of the first applicant.,conclusion,[]
"(see the James and Others judgment, loc. cit.).",premise,[]
Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority,conclusion,"['she challenge company tent', 'she challenge authority']"
"Family ties cannot imply a criminal relationship between the author of the offence and his or her relatives; nor can the ""co-operative"" nature of the crime be considered a valid basis for a reasonable suspicion of complicity on the part of members of the family or friends of the criminal.",premise,"['family tie not imply relationship', 'nature sidere basis']"
These circumstances may give rise only to a bona fide suspicion of such complicity.,premise,"['circumstance give rise', 'circumstance give suspicion']"
"They do not give rise to a ""reasonable"" suspicion such as to justify the serious measures taken against the applicants unless they are connected with other facts in direct relation to the offence.",premise,"['they give rise', 'they give suspicion', 'suspicion justify measure', 'measure take applicant', 'they necte fact', 'they necte relation']"
"No facts of this kind have however been furnished by the respondent Government, although, in our opinion, they could have been supplied without jeopardising the confidentiality of the source of information which is necessary to protect the life and personal safety of that source (paragraph 52 of the judgment).",premise,"['fact furnish respondent government', 'they supply company fidentiality']"
"The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case.",conclusion,"['<ORG> state majority paragraph', 'company dition lay sub paragraph']"
"Regarding the alleged violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, in our view the evidence as to Mrs Murray’s questioning at the military screening centre (paragraphs 16 to 27 of the judgment), the vague indications and the questions put to her lack the necessary precision to justify a conclusion that she was informed of the reasons for her arrest.",premise,"['<NAME> question screening centre', 'evidence lack precision', 'precision justify company clusion', 'she inform reason']"
"From the recorded questions about her brothers or ""about money and about America"", it is not possible for us to conclude that it was apparent to her ""that she was questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"".",premise,['she question involvement']
"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty.",premise,"['Court declare paragraph', 'company tain safeguard', 'he deprive liberty']"
"This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)"".",premise,"['protection afford article', 'person tell language', 'he understand ground']"
"In our opinion, bearing in mind the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the questions put to Mrs Murray in the course of her interrogation (paragraphs 14 and 21 of the judgment), the information given to Mrs Murray did not meet this basic standard.",conclusion,"['totality include nature', 'question put to', 'question put interrogation paragraph', 'information give to', 'information meet standard']"
"The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case.",premise,"['<ORG> state majority paragraph', 'company dition lay sub paragraph']"
"With due respect to the review that the national courts have conducted of the facts of the case (paragraph 60 of the judgment) and to their findings and conclusions in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, it falls to our Court, pursuant to Article 19 (art. 19) of the Convention, to ensure the observance of the engagement undertaken by the States Parties under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure everyone within their jurisdiction, inter alia, the right to liberty and the right to respect for private life.",premise,"['it fall court', 'engagement undertake state party', 'engagement undertake article']"
In the exercise of this power of review the Court must ascertain whether the essence of the safeguard afforded by this provision of the Convention has been secured.,premise,['safeguard afford provision']
"""Consequently, the respondent Government have to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 18, para. 34).",conclusion,"['government have fact', 'fact satisfy Court', 'person suspect offence']"
"As to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention, since Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention were in breach of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), she was entitled to an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with this provision.",premise,"['she entitle right', 'she entitle accordance']"
"We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5).",premise,['<ORG> find violation']
The alleged violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is directly linked with the issues under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention.,premise,['of link issue']
"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).",conclusion,"['breach find circumstance', 'measure interfere life', 'measure not regard society', 'measure not regard prevention', 'measure not regard accordance']"
"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).",premise,"['breach find circumstance', 'measure interfere life', 'measure not regard society', 'measure not regard prevention', 'measure not regard accordance']"
We therefore also find a violation of this provision of the Convention.,conclusion,['we find violation']
"because of the short duration of the detention,",premise,[]
"In the concrete circumstances of the case, I am prepared to allow that promptness can be waived",conclusion,[]
"once the first applicant was arrested (and not merely asked to go voluntarily to a place designated for interrogation) she was entitled to be told why she was being arrested - which in effect means ""that she was suspected of having committed a given offence"".",premise,"['applicant arrest number', 'number ask place', 'place designate interrogation', 'she suspect offence']"
"Once that is done, the further information that she was being charged with a given offence can, within a reasonable time, follow.",premise,['she charge offence']
"This, however, must be preceded by the first phase, wherein the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for the arrest.",premise,"['this precede phase', 'person inform reason']"
"This phase cannot be skipped, ignored or disregarded, especially when, as in this case, the person arrested is not charged with an offence.",premise,[]
"In the view of the majority (paragraph 77 of the judgment) this guarantee was satisfied because ""it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"", which induces the Court to come to the conclusion that ""the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview"".",premise,"['she question involvement', 'which induce Court', 'which induce company clusion', 'reason bring attention', 'reason bring interview']"
And therefore there was no violation.,conclusion,['there be number violation']
"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future.",premise,"['decision reduce meaning', 'it adhere form', 'it have company crete application', 'it have future']"
"In fact what is being held here is that through the contents of an interrogation an accused person can, by inference or deduction, arrive, on his own, to understand ""the reasons for his arrest and ... any charge against him"".",premise,['person arrive arrest']
"Since the Convention obliges the investigating officer ""to inform"" the arrested person, I cannot agree that the duty imposed on the investigating officer can be satisfied by the obligation of the arrested person to carry out a logical exercise so that he will thereby know of the charge against him - surmising both, from the contents of the interrogation.",conclusion,"['Convention oblige officer', 'Convention oblige person', 'duty impose officer', 'duty satisfy obligation', 'obligation carry exercise', 'he know charge', 'obligation surmise company tent', 'obligation surmise interrogation']"
It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).,premise,[]
"If it is sustained, then it would mean that the guarantee therein contemplated will only come into play in situations such as that which is described in Franz Kafka’s masterpiece The Trial, where the Inspector, who is supposed to interrogate K (the accused person), tells K , ""I can’t even confirm that you are charged with an offence, or rather I don’t know whether you are.",premise,"['it mean I', 'guarantee company play', 'guarantee company situation', 'which describe <NAME>', 'who suppose person', 'inspector interrogate person', 'inspector tell company firm', 'you charge offence']"
"You are under arrest certainly, more than that I do not know.""",premise,[]
"English translation by W. and E. Muir from the German original Der Prozess – Penguin reprint 1953, p. 18.",premise,[]
"Therefore, the interpretation arrived at is a substantial limitation of the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2), to which I cannot subscribe, and I find that there was a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).",conclusion,"['I not subscribe I', 'there be violation']"
"In the examination of the matter of ""reasonable suspicion"", the key issue seems to me to be whether ""at least some facts or information"" were furnished by the Government, which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence.",premise,"['issue seem I', 'fact furnish government', 'which satisfy observer', 'person mitte offence']"
In my opinion this condition of reasonableness was not fulfilled.,premise,[]
"It was suggested by the representative of the Government that ""primary facts"", obtained from a reliable confidential source, which cannot be disclosed must be differentiated from ""something other than the primary facts or information"".",premise,"['it suggest representative', 'fact obtain source', 'fact differentiate fact']"
"Elements of the latter kind, he claimed, had been provided which should be capable of so satisfying an objective observer.",premise,['element satisfy observer']
"He cited: (a) the honest belief of the arresting officer, (b) the briefing by a superior officer, and (c) circumstances preventing disclosure of information.",premise,"['he cite briefing', 'he cite circumstance', 'circumstance prevent disclosure']"
"In my view all three are capable of satisfying the condition of an honest or genuine suspicion, but do not constitute ""at least some facts or information"" on which a reasonable suspicion could be based.",premise,['company stitute fact']
"Neither honesty of an arresting officer, nor honesty of superior officer, nor the circumstances of a suspected terrorist crime fall into this category.",premise,['honesty fall category']
"At the hearing the Government’s representative also identified three other kinds of more specific ""objective evidence"", namely the conviction of the first applicant’s brothers, her contacts with them and her visits to America.",premise,['<ORG> identify kind']
"The problem with these facts, as I see it, is that none of them per se may be held against the first applicant to incriminate her.",premise,"['I see it', 'number hold applicant']"
"They rather resemble the incrimination of a person’s status, in this case the first applicant’s kinship relationship.",premise,['they resemble incrimination']
"I am therefore led to conclude that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in respect of the first applicant, following the reasoning in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment (judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182).",conclusion,[]
"A usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be.",premise,"['officer entertain suspicion', 'offence mitte detainee']"
This difference may justify differential treatment of evidence supporting such reasons in terms of their confidentiality.,conclusion,"['difference justify treatment', 'evidence support reason']"
because I do not see a necessary link between the breach of the requirements of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the interference in the private and family life of Mrs Murray (and her family).,premise,['I see link']
I voted for non-violation of Article 8 (art. 8),conclusion,['I vote number violation']

"In the former class, for example, was an attack in which they alleged that the use of section 14 of the [1978 Act] in this case was an example of what they called ‘an institutionalised form of unlawful screening’ by the military authorities, with the intention of obtaining what counsel termed ‘low level intelligence’ from the plaintiff, and without (a) any genuine suspicion on the part of those authorities that she had committed a criminal offence or (b) any genuine intention on their part of questioning her about a criminal offence alleged to have been committed by her.""",non-argumentative,"['they allege screening', 'they call form', 'intention obtain plaintiff', '<ORG> term level intelligence', 'intention question she', 'intention question offence']"

She stated that her suspicion of the first applicant had been formed on the basis of everything she had been told at the briefing and which she had read in a document which had been supplied to her then.

Murray J. likewise rejected the first applicant’s argument that the photographing of her gave rise to a cause of action.,non-argumentative,"['<NAME> reject applicants argument', 'photographing give rise', 'photographing give cause']"

The only other witness as to the conduct of this interview was the [first applicant].,non-argumentative,[]
"Her account also is sketchy, though in somewhat more detail.",non-argumentative,[]
What is clear from both witnesses is that the [first applicant] was deliberately unhelpful and refused to answer most of the questions.,non-argumentative,[]

Proceedings before the House of Lords,non-argumentative,[]
The first applicant was granted leave by the Court of Appeal to appeal to the House of Lords.,non-argumentative,['applicant grant leave']
"This appeal was rejected on 25 May 1988 (Murray v. Ministry of Defence, [1988] Weekly Law Reports 692).",non-argumentative,[]
In the House of Lords the applicant did not pursue the allegation that she had not been arrested on the basis of a genuine and honest suspicion that she had committed an offence.,non-argumentative,"['applicant pursue allegation', 'she arrest basis', 'she mitte offence']"
"She did however pursue the complaint, previously raised before the Court of Appeal, that since she was only lawfully arrested at 7.30 a.m.",non-argumentative,"['she pursue company plaint', 'she arrest a.m.']"
she had been unlawfully detained between 7.00 and 7.30 a.m.,non-argumentative,['she detain a.m.']
The House of Lords found that a person is arrested from the moment he is subject to restraint and that the first applicant was therefore under arrest from the moment that Corporal D. identified her on entering the house at 7 a.m.,non-argumentative,"['<ORG> find applicant', 'person arrest moment', 'Corporal identify she', 'Corporal identify house', 'moment enter house', 'moment enter a.m.']"
It made no difference that the formal words of arrest were communicated to the applicant at 7.30 a.m.,non-argumentative,"['it make number difference', 'word municate applicant', 'word municate a.m.']"
In this respect Lord Griffiths stated (at pp. 698H-699A):,non-argumentative,['<NAME> state pp']
"""If the plaintiff had been told she was under arrest the moment she identified herself, it would not have made the slightest difference to the sequence of events before she left the house.",non-argumentative,"['she identify herself', 'it make difference', 'she leave house']"
"It would have been wholly unreasonable to take her off, half-clad, to the Army centre, and the same half-hour would have elapsed while she gathered herself together and completed her toilet and dressing.",non-argumentative,"['hour elapse company', 'she gather herself', 'company plete toilet', 'company plete dressing']"
"It would seem a strange result that in these circumstances, whether or not she has an action for false imprisonment should depend upon whether the words of arrest are spoken on entering or leaving the house, when the practical effect of the difference on the plaintiff is non-existent.""",non-argumentative,['it seem result']
The first applicant had also maintained that the failure to inform her that she was arrested until the soldiers were about to leave the house rendered the arrest unlawful.,non-argumentative,"['failure inform she', 'failure leave house']"
This submission was also rejected by the House of Lords. Lord Griffiths held as follows (at pp. 699H-701A):,non-argumentative,['<NAME> hold pp']
"""It is a feature of the very limited power of arrest contained in section 14 that a member of the armed forces does not have to tell the arrested person the offence of which he is suspected, for it is specifically provided by section 14(2) that it is sufficient if he states that he is effecting the arrest as a member of Her Majesty’s forces.",non-argumentative,"['company taine section', 'member have person', 'member have offence', 'it provide section', 'he effect arrest', 'he effect member']"
Corporal D. was carrying out this arrest in accordance with the procedures in which she had been instructed to make a house arrest pursuant to section 14.,non-argumentative,"['<NAME> carry arrest', '<NAME> carry accordance', 'she instruct house arrest', 'procedure make house arrest']"
This procedure appears to me to be designed to make the arrest with the least risk of injury to those involved including both the soldiers and the occupants of the house.,non-argumentative,"['procedure appear I', 'injury include soldier', 'injury include occupant']"
When arrests are made on suspicion of involvement with the IRA it would be to close one’s eyes to the obvious not to appreciate the risk that the arrest may be forcibly resisted.,non-argumentative,['arrest make suspicion']
The drill the Army follow is to enter the house and search every room for occupants.,non-argumentative,[]
"The occupants are all directed to assemble in one room, and when the person the soldiers have come to arrest has been identified and is ready to leave, the formal words of arrest are spoken just before they leave the house.",non-argumentative,"['occupant direct room', 'soldier have company', 'they leave house']"
"The Army do not carry out a search for property in the house and, in my view, they would not be justified in doing so.",non-argumentative,['<ORG> carry search']
"The power of search is given ‘for the purpose of arresting a person’, not for a search for incriminating evidence.",non-argumentative,"['power give purpose', 'purpose arrest person number', 'purpose arrest search']"
It is however a proper exercise of the power of search for the purpose of effecting the arrest to search every room for other occupants of the house in case there may be those there who are disposed to resist the arrest.,non-argumentative,"['purpose effect arrest', 'case dispose arrest', 'case resist arrest']"
The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable.,non-argumentative,[]
I also regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room.,non-argumentative,"['I regard it', 'I regard precaution', 'occupant ask room', 'precaution assemble room']"
"As Corporal D. explained in evidence, this procedure is followed because the soldiers may be distracted by other occupants in the house rushing from one room to another, perhaps in a state of alarm, perhaps for the purpose of raising the alarm and to resist the arrest.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> explain evidence', 'soldier distract occupant', 'occupant rush room', 'occupant rush purpose', 'purpose raise alarm', 'occupant resist arrest']"
"In such circumstances a tragic shooting accident might all too easily happen with young, and often relatively inexperienced, armed soldiers operating under conditions of extreme tension.",non-argumentative,['soldier operate company dition']
"Your Lordships were told that the husband and children either had commenced, or were contemplating commencing, actions for false imprisonment arising out of the fact that they were asked to assemble in the living-room for a short period before the plaintiff was taken from the house.",non-argumentative,"['they ask room', 'they ask period', 'fact assemble room', 'fact assemble period', 'plaintiff take house']"
That very short period of restraint when they were asked to assemble in the living room was a proper and necessary part of the procedure for effecting the peaceable arrest of the plaintiff.,non-argumentative,"['they ask living room', 'period assemble living room', 'procedure effect arrest']"
"It was a temporary restraint of very short duration imposed not only for the benefit of those effecting the arrest, but also for the protection of the occupants of the house and would be wholly insufficient to found an action for unlawful imprisonment.",non-argumentative,['benefit effect arrest']
It was in my opinion entirely reasonable to delay speaking the words of arrest until the party was about to leave the house.,non-argumentative,[]
"If words of arrest are spoken as soon as the house is entered before any precautions have been taken to search the house and find the other occupants, it seems to me that there is a real risk that the alarm may be raised and an attempt made to resist arrest, not only by those within the house but also by summoning assistance from those in the immediate neighbourhood.",non-argumentative,"['it seem I', 'there be risk', 'there be attempt', 'attempt make attempt', 'attempt resist arrest', 'attempt resist house', 'attempt summon assistance', 'attempt summon neighbourhood']"
"When soldiers are employed on the difficult and potentially dangerous task of carrying out a house arrest of a person suspected of an offence in connection with the IRA, it is I think essential that they should have been trained in the drill they are to follow.",non-argumentative,"['soldier employ task', 'task carry house arrest', 'person suspect offence', 'person suspect company nection', 'I think essential', 'they train drill']"
It would be impracticable and I think potentially dangerous to leave it to the individual discretion of the particular soldier making the arrest to devise his own procedures for carrying out this unfamiliar military function.,non-argumentative,"['soldier make arrest', 'procedure carry function']"
"It is in everyone’s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the Army are sensible, reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned.",non-argumentative,[]
"I would however add this rider: that if the suspect, for any reason, refuses to accept the fact of restraint in the house he should be informed forthwith that he is under arrest.""",non-argumentative,"['I add rider', 'suspect refuse fact', 'rider accept fact']"
efore the House of Lords the first applicant also pursued a claim that her period of detention exceeded what was reasonably required to make a decision whether to release her or hand her over to the police.,non-argumentative,"['applicant pursue claim', 'period exceed decision', 'what require decision', 'claim make decision', 'decision release she', 'decision hand she', 'decision hand police']"
"In this regard the applicant complained that the standard record form (the ""screening proforma"") constituted an improper basis for questioning a suspect on the ground that it asked questions not directly relevant to the suspected offence; it was also suggested that the evidence did not show that the questioning of the applicant was directed to the matters of which she was suspected.",non-argumentative,"['record form stitute basis', 'record form stitute ground', 'basis question suspect', 'it ask question', 'it ask number', 'questioning direct matter']"

"It is relevant but not decisive that the domestic legislation at the time merely imposed this essentially subjective standard: the Court’s task is to determine whether the objective standard of ""reasonable suspicion"" laid down in Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) was met in the circumstances of the application of the legislation in the particular case.",non-argumentative,"['legislation impose standard', 'standard lay article para']"

What may be regarded as ‘reasonable’ will however depend upon all the circumstances.,non-argumentative,[]

In the civil action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence the trial court judge found that on the evidence before him the purpose of her arrest and detention under section 14 of the 1978 Act had been to establish facts concerning the offence of which she was suspected (see paragraph 25 above).,non-argumentative,[]

"The first applicant also alleged absence of the required proper purpose by reason of the fact that in practice persons arrested by the Army under section 14 were never brought before a competent legal authority by the Army but, if the suspicions were confirmed during questioning, were handed over to the police who preferred charges and took the necessary action to bring the person before a court.",non-argumentative,"['applicant allege absence', 'applicant allege reason', 'person arrest section', 'person never bring authority', 'suspicion firm questioning', 'fact hand police', 'who prefer charge', 'police take action', 'action bring person']"

"The Commission, citing the Court’s case-law (see the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 47-48, paras. 85-86), concluded that in so far as the first applicant’s complaint was directed against the content of Northern Ireland law, Article 13 (art. 13) did not confer any entitlement to a remedy; and that, if she could be taken to be objecting to the manner in which that law had been applied in her case, she could have brought an action before the Northern Ireland courts.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> see <NAME>', '<ORG> see United Kingdom judgment', 'company plaint direct company tent', 'entitlement take manner', 'entitlement object manner', 'law apply case', 'company ld bring action']"

"Although we agree with the majority of the Court that, when interpreting and applying the Convention, due account should be taken of the special nature of terrorist crime, of the exigencies of investigating terrorist activities and of the necessity of not jeopardising the confidentiality of reliable sources of information, we cannot concur with its conclusion of no violation of Article 5 paras. 1, 2 and 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5), and Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention in the present case.",non-argumentative,"['we agree majority', 'account interpret account', 'account apply Convention', 'account take nature', 'exigency investigate activity', 'number jeopardise company fidentiality']"
"On the contrary, a violation of the applicants’ fundamental rights to liberty and security and to respect for private life is disclosed by the circumstances of the case, namely the Army’s entry into and search of the applicants’ home at 7 a.m. without warrant; the assembling of Mrs Murray’s husband and four children in a room of the house during half an hour; her arrest and detention during two hours for questioning in a military screening centre on suspicion of her involvement in terrorist activities because her brothers had been convicted in the United States of America of offences connected with the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA; and the failure to inform her of the reasons for her arrest (paragraphs 9 to 34 of the judgment).",non-argumentative,"['violation disclose circumstance', 'failure inform she', 'failure inform reason']"
"Regarding the arrest and detention of Mrs Murray, we regret that we are not convinced by the majority’s arguments, particularly in paragraphs 62 and 63, as to the reasonableness of the suspicion that she had committed the above-mentioned offence; nor do we find that the facts of this case are materially different from those in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment , where the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) because it considered the elements furnished by the Government to be insufficient to support the conclusion that there had been a ""reasonable suspicion"" that the arrested persons had committed an offence.",non-argumentative,"['we regret we', 'we vince majority argument', 'we vince paragraph', 'she mitte offence number', '<ORG> find violation', 'element furnish government', 'person mitte offence']"
"The conviction in the United States of Mrs Murray’s two brothers of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her visit to her brothers there and the reference to the collaboration with ""trustworthy"" persons residing in Northern Ireland implied by such offences are not, in our opinion, sufficient grounds for reasonably suspecting the first applicant of involvement in the offence of collecting funds in Northern Ireland to buy arms in the United States for terrorist purposes.",non-argumentative,"['person imply offence', 'ground suspect applicant', 'ground suspect involvement', 'ground buy arm', 'ground buy purpose']"
"In the instant case the specific circumstances of the entry into and search of the applicants’ home by the Army, the limited role of the Army in the investigation of terrorist crimes under United Kingdom law (paragraphs 36 to 38 of the judgment) and, moreover, the personal circumstances of Mrs Murray, a mother of four children with health problems and no criminal record (paragraph 9 of the judgment and document Cour (93) 290, Annexes A-B, pp.100 B-C, 116 B-C), required a higher level of suspicion and the application to the respondent Government of a stricter standard when justifying before this Court the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion.",non-argumentative,"['circumstance require level', 'circumstance require application', 'circumstance require level', 'circumstance require application', 'record paragraph require level', 'record paragraph require application', '. require level', '. require application', 'document require level', 'document require application', 'standard justify reasonableness']"

The scope of their examination was confined to that.,non-argumentative,[]
"I am in agreement with the majority on most of the points at issue in this case, starting with the finding that the arrest of the first applicant was carried out on a reasonable suspicion that she had committed an offence; thereby holding that Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) was not violated.",non-argumentative,"['point start finding', 'arrest carry suspicion', 'she mitte offence']"
"I dissent, however, on the second point; that of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2), which guarantees to ""everyone who is arrested"" the right to be ""informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him"".",non-argumentative,"['I dissent point', 'which guarantee right', 'right inform language', 'right inform reason']"
"The essential and relevant facts, as accepted in the judgment are that: (a) When Corporal D. proceeded to the first applicant’s house, she said to her, ""As a member of Her Majesty’s forces, I arrest you."" And on being asked twice by the first applicant under what section, Corporal D. replied, ""Section 14"" (paragraph 12 of the judgment). (b) Corporal D. told the domestic court that ""the purpose of arrest and detention under section 14 was not to gather intelligence but to question a suspected person about an offence"" (paragraph 20 of the judgment). This was confirmed by Sergeant B. (paragraph 22). 3.

"However, the existence of an emergency may be used to argue in favour of both interests involved, namely that of the Government and that of the arrested person.",non-argumentative,['existence use favour']
"For example, under emergency laws, individual rights may be abused even more easily and on a larger scale than in normal times.",non-argumentative,['right abuse scale']
They should therefore be given an even more careful protection in view of the intensity of national interests in taking repressive measures against crime.,non-argumentative,"['they give protection', 'they give view', 'interest take measure']"
"Suspects should thus not be denied being provided with at least some evidence and grounds for their arrest, in order to be able to challenge the allegations against them.",non-argumentative,"['suspect deny evidence', 'suspect deny ground']"
Neither should the competent domestic court be left without persuasive evidence supporting the required reasonableness of the arrest.,non-argumentative,"['company leave evidence', 'evidence support reasonableness']"

But are the items obtained all and always relevant? We may assume that at least some of them are irrelevant or already notorious.,non-argumentative,[]

"My underlying philosophic approach having been identified, some more ""technical"" points about the case may be made.",non-argumentative,[]
"The search for a balance between the State’s interest in fighting crime and the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights is the obvious task of the Strasbourg Court. To this end I would propose clarifying the following preliminary issues: First, what is the relationship between the Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) requirement of ""reasonable suspicion"" and the Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) right to be ""informed promptly of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him""?",non-argumentative,"['States interest fight crime', 'I propose issue', 'right inform reason']"
Are grounds for reasonable suspicion identical to reasons for arrest?,non-argumentative,[]
Two questions seem to me relevant in this respect.,non-argumentative,"['question seem relevant', 'question seem I']"
"First, is there a difference between revealing information to the suspect and then producing it in court? Probably not. And secondly, is there a difference between information made available to the court and information produced in a court, that is revealed to the suspect?",non-argumentative,"['difference reveal information', 'difference reveal suspect', 'difference produce it', 'information make available', 'that reveal suspect']"
"A further point is that the Court referred in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley case to ""information which ... cannot ... be revealed to the suspect or produced in court to support the charge"".",non-argumentative,"['Court refer case', 'Court refer information', 'which not reveal suspect', 'information produce company rt', 'information support charge']"
"In this connection I see some scope for compromise between the wish to preserve the Fox, Campbell and Hartley standard and, at the same time, the need to expand and elaborate its reasoning in order to adapt it better to the Murray case and other similar cases.",non-argumentative,"['I see scope', 'wish preserve standard', 'need expand need', 'need elaborate reasoning', 'need adapt it', 'need adapt <NAME>', 'need adapt case']"
"The ""technical"" question could also be posed whether otherwise confidential information could not be rephrased, reshaped or tailored in order to protect its source and then be revealed.",non-argumentative,[]
"In this respect the domestic court could seek an alternative, independent expert opinion, without relying solely on the assertions of the arresting authority.",non-argumentative,['<ORG> seek expert opinion']
"I am satisfied with the approach of the Court in regard to Article 8 (art. 8), and, in particular, with its conclusion that the interference was in accordance with the law and that the contested measures pursued a legitimate aim and were necessary in a democratic society (paragraphs 88 to 94 of the judgment).",non-argumentative,"['company test measure', 'measure pursue aim']"
"However, in the light of my views as to the violation of various provisions of Article 5 (art. 5), I cannot subscribe to the Court’s reasoning in paragraph 92 of the judgment, namely that Mrs Murray was reasonably suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime and that this fact justified the need to enter and search her home.",non-argumentative,"['I not subscribe <ORG>', '<NAME> suspect company mission', 'fact justify need', 'need enter need', 'need search home']"
The finding of non-violation of Article 8 (art. 8) can be sufficiently well grounded regardless of the reasoning in paragraph 92 of the Court’s judgment.,non-argumentative,[]
Purpose of the arrest,non-argumentative,[]
