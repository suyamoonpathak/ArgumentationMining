"The Court recalls that the scope of its jurisdiction is determined by the Commission’s decision on admissibility and that it has no power to entertain new and separate complaints which were not raised before the Commission (see, inter alia, the Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 293, para. 44).",argumentative,"['Court recall it', 'scope determine <ORG>', 'it have number power', 'number power entertain company plaint', 'number power see <NAME>']"
"However, while Mr Findlay in his application to the Commission may not expressly have invoked his rights under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) to a ""public hearing"" and a ""tribunal established by law"", he does appear to have raised in substance most of the matters which form the basis of his complaints in relation to these two provisions.",argumentative,"['<NAME> invoke right', '<NAME> invoke .', 'tribunal establish law', 'he appear most', 'he appear substance', 'which form basis', 'which form relation']"
"Thus, in the Commission’s decision on admissibility, he is reported as referring in particular to the facts that the members of the court martial were appointed ad hoc, that the judge advocate’s advice on sentencing was not disclosed, that no reasons were given for the decisions taken by the court-martial board and the confirming and reviewing officers, and that the post-hearing reviews were essentially administrative in nature and conducted in private (see the Commission’s decision on admissibility, application no. 22107/93, pp. 32 35).",argumentative,"['he report review', 'member appoint review', 'judge advocate advice disclose review', 'number reason give review', 'company firm number reason', 'number reason review officer', 'fact see <ORG>']"
"It follows that these are not new and separate complaints, and that the Court has jurisdiction to consider these matters (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, p. 46, para. 80).",argumentative,"['it follow Court', 'Court have jurisdiction', 'Court have matter']"
"since they involved the determination of Mr Findlay’s sentence following his plea of guilty to criminal charges; indeed, this point was not disputed before it",argumentative,"['they involve determination', 'determination follow plea']"
"(see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 18 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 33-36, paras. 80-85, and the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 34-35, paras. 76-77).",argumentative,[]
"In the view of the Court, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is clearly applicable to the court-martial proceedings,",argumentative,[]
"because, inter alia, all the officers appointed to it were directly subordinate to the convening officer who also performed the role of prosecuting authority",argumentative,['who perform role']
The lack of legal qualification or experience in the officers making the decisions either at the court martial or review stages made it impossible for them to act in an independent or impartial manner.,argumentative,"['officer make decision', 'officer make stage', 'they act manner']"
"The applicant complained that the court martial was not an ""independent and impartial tribunal"" as required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6 1),",argumentative,['tribunal require article para']
"because the statutory framework according to which it proceeded was too vague and imprecise; for example, it was silent on the question of how the convening officer, confirming officer and reviewing authorities were to be appointed.",argumentative,[]
"Finally, he claimed that his court martial was not a tribunal ""established by law"",",argumentative,['tribunal establish law']
"The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay’s case.",argumentative,"['company vening officer play role', 'company vening officer play hearing']"
He decided which charges should be brought and which type of court martial was most appropriate.,argumentative,"['he decide type', 'charge bring type']"
He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).,argumentative,"['company vene paragraph', 'officer prosecute officer']"
"Under the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible.",argumentative,"['he have task', 'task send abstract', 'task send judge advocate', 'task send officer', 'company ld indicate passage']"
"He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those ""reasonably requested"" by the defence.",argumentative,"['he procure attendance', 'prosecution request defence']"
His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).,argumentative,['officer accept plea']
"For these reasons the Court, like the Commission, considers that the convening officer was central to Mr Findlay’s prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities.",argumentative,[]
The question therefore arises whether the members of the court martial were sufficiently independent of the convening officer and whether the organisation of the trial offered adequate guarantees of impartiality.,argumentative,"['question arise organisation', 'organisation offer guarantee']"
"It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above).",argumentative,['company appoint company vening officer']
"Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above).",argumentative,['vening officer have power']
"Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified",argumentative,['which decide <NAME>']
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Sramek v. Austria judgment of 22 October 1984, Series A no. 84, p. 20, para. 42).",argumentative,[]

". Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified",argumentative,['which decide <NAME>']
"In addition, the Court finds it significant that the convening officer also acted as ""confirming officer"".",argumentative,['vening officer act officer']
"Thus, the decision of the court martial was not effective until ratified by him, and he had the power to vary the sentence imposed as he saw fit (see paragraph 48 above). This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of ""tribunal"" and can also be seen as a component of the ""independence"" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45).",argumentative,"['he have power', 'he have paragraph', 'power vary sentence', 'power give decision', 'which alter authority', 'principle see company ponent', 'independence require article para']"
"The Court further agrees with the Commission that these fundamental flaws in the court-martial system were not remedied by the presence of safeguards, such as the involvement of the judge advocate, who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public (see paragraphs 45-46 above), or the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board (see paragraph 35 above).",argumentative,"['Court agree advice', 'Court agree involvement', 'Court agree involvement', 'flaw remedie presence', 'advice make public', 'involvement see paragraph', 'oath take member', 'involvement see paragraph']"
Nor could the defects referred to above (in paragraphs 75 and 77) be corrected by any subsequent review proceedings.,argumentative,['defect refer paragraph']
"Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as ""criminal"" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para.",argumentative,"['charge classify law', 'applicants hearing entitle instance tribunal', 'he entitle instance tribunal', 'which meet requirement']"
"(see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, pp. 16-18, paras. 31-32).",argumentative,[]
"Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as ""criminal"" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para.",argumentative,"['charge classify law', 'applicants hearing entitle instance tribunal', 'he entitle instance tribunal', 'which meet requirement']"
"First, there were no grounds for believing that the applicant would not have been convicted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment and dismissed from the army following his trial (at which he pleaded guilty), even if the court martial had been differently organised.",argumentative,"['there be number ground', 'number ground believe number ground', 'applicant sentence term', 'number ground dismiss army', 'number ground follow trial']"
"Secondly, it was in any case unlikely that he would have enjoyed a long career in the army, in view of the post traumatic stress disorder and back injury from which he suffered (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 30 above); he had already received GBP 100,000 in settlement of his civil claim against the Ministry of Defence, a large part of which related to loss of earning capacity.",argumentative,"['he enjoy career', 'he enjoy view', 'he receive GBP', 'he receive settlement', 'part relate loss']"
"The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient satisfaction, or, in the alternative, that only a very modest amount should be awarded.",argumentative,"['government submit amount', 'finding stitute satisfaction']"
"At the hearing, the Commission’s Delegate observed that no causal link had been established between the breach of the Convention complained of by the applicant and the alleged pecuniary damage, and submitted that it was not possible to speculate as to whether the proceedings would have led to a different outcome had they fulfilled the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",argumentative,"['<ORG> observe breach', 'link establish breach', 'link establish damage', 'breach plain applicant', 'proceeding lead outcome', 'they fulfil requirement']"
"The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient satisfaction, or, in the alternative, that only a very modest amount should be awarded.",argumentative,"['government submit amount', 'finding stitute satisfaction']"
"(see, for example, the Schmautzer v. Austria judgment of 23 October 1995, Series A no. 328-A, p. 16, para. 44).",argumentative,[]
The Court agrees; it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the court-martial proceedings might have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred,argumentative,[]
"The complaint concerning Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement 64. In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. The Judge Advocate General, Judge Rant, had commented: ""These are extremely serious allegations ..."". In a later letter, Judge Rant wrote: ""I wish to make it clear that, at this stage and without prejudice to any action which might have to be taken in the future, I am making no formal complaint about the passage [from the applicant’s submission to the Commission] quoted in that letter. The reason for this is that the case of Findlay is to be argued before the European Court of Human Rights in September 1996 and therefore it is only proper for me to defer action until the end of those proceedings.""",argumentative,"['body company cerne matter', 'solicitor make allegation', 'which have future', 'action take future', 'I make company plaint', 'applicants submission quote letter', 'I defer action', 'I defer end']"

The applicant alleged that his solicitor felt constrained in presenting his arguments to the Court in the knowledge that they might subsequently form the basis of disciplinary proceedings and he invoked his rights under Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement relating to Persons Participating in Proceedings before the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.,argumentative,"['applicant allege he', 'they form basis', 'he invoke right']"
"(see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 15, para. 37).",argumentative,[]
"The Court recalls that in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered as ""independent"", regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence",argumentative,"['Court recall existence', 'regard have existence', 'regard have question', 'body present appearance']"
"For these reasons the Court, like the Commission, considers that the convening officer was central to Mr Findlay’s prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities.",argumentative,[]

"In addition, he asserted that he was not afforded a ""public hearing"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), in that the judge advocate’s advice to the court-martial board, the confirming officer and the reviewing authorities was confidential; no reasons were given for the decisions made at any of these stages in the proceedings; and the process of confirming and reviewing the verdict and sentence by the confirming officer and reviewing authorities was carried out administratively, in private, with no apparent rules of procedure (see paragraphs 42-46 and 48-51 above).",non-argumentative,"['he afford hearing', 'he afford meaning', 'judge advocate advice', 'number reason give process', 'process firm process', 'process review verdict', 'process review sentence', 'process carry paragraph']"
The Government had no observations to make upon the Commission’s conclusion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) by reason of the width of the role of the convening officer and his command links with members of the tribunal.,non-argumentative,['Government have number observation']

"He also acted as confirming officer, and the court martial’s findings had no effect until confirmed by him.",non-argumentative,"['he act officer', 'company rt martial finding have number effect']"

The requirement to take an oath was not a sufficient guarantee of independence.,non-argumentative,['requirement take oath']

"This defect was not, moreover, remedied by any subsequent review by a judicial body affording all the guarantees required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), since the confirming officer was the same person as the convening officer, and the reviewing authorities were army officers, the second of whom was superior in rank to the first.",non-argumentative,"['defect remedie review', 'body afford guarantee', 'guarantee require article para']"

"As to the question of ""impartiality"", there are two aspects to this requirement. First, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias.",non-argumentative,['there be aspect']
"Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see the Pullar v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 792, para. 30).",non-argumentative,"['it offer guarantee', 'guarantee exclude doubt']"
The concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked and the Court will consider them together as they relate to the present case.,non-argumentative,"['company cept link <ORG>', '<ORG> sider they', 'they relate case']"
In this respect also the Court shares the concerns of the Commission.,non-argumentative,['Court share company cern']
