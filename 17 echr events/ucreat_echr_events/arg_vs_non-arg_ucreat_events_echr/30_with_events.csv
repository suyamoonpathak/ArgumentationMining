"that the Convening Officer is not the prosecuting authority,",argumentative,[]

The Government also argue that the Judge Advocate must satisfy himself that none of the members of the court-martial knows the accused or has heard anything about the charges.,argumentative,"['Judge Advocate satisfy himself', 'number know accuse']"
"In the present case the applicant did not object to the constitution of the court-martial and in any event, according to the Government, it does not follow from the fact that the members of the court-martial were all subordinate in rank to the Convening Officer (having no direct prior relationship with that Officer) that they lacked independence or impartiality.",argumentative,"['applicant object company stitution', 'it follow fact', 'Convening officer have relationship', 'they lack independence']"

"The applicant also points, in this respect, to an inequality of arms between the prosecution and the defence due to the Convening Officer's effective control of the court-martial hearing through the prosecuting officer, and to the conduct of the prosecuting officer, the Judge Advocate and the Convening Officer (the latter of whom allegedly failed to ensure the attendance of a vital witness) in respect of that hearing.",argumentative,"['applicant point respect', 'applicant point inequality', 'latter fail attendance', 'latter fail respect', 'officer ensure attendance', 'officer ensure respect']"

"Secondly, the applicant complains that the court-martial hearing and the post-hearing reviews were neither fair nor public.",argumentative,[]
"The second Reviewing Authority did not seek any such advice, and therefore a person without any legal qualifications or advice made the final decision on the applicant's petition against sentence.",argumentative,"['<ORG> seek advice', 'person make decision']"
"The Government also submit that, in light of the importance of discipline in the armed forces and in view of the seriousness of the charges, the reasons for the sentence were obvious.",argumentative,[]

"The applicant has, according to the Government, no right to an appeal under the Convention and, in any event, the post- hearing reviews are not, according to the Government, designed to be full appeals, but rather further pleas in mitigation.",argumentative,"['applicant have number right', 'number design appeal']"
"In respect of the sentencing regime, the Government submit that the question of whether the accused is tried by the civilian or military authorities is a decision for the civilian authorities, though by agreement the military authorities do not have to report certain matters to the civilian authorities.",argumentative,"['accuse try authority', 'authority have matter', 'authority have authority']"
A wider sentencing regime is not possible due to the lack of facilities in the armed forces and to the fact that some sentences would be inappropriate to pass upon a serving member of the armed forces and inconsistent with his duties.,argumentative,[]
"The Government further submit that the decision of the court-martial was reasonable in view of, inter alia, the importance of discipline in army life, the context in which the offences were committed and the seriousness of the charges.",argumentative,['government submit importance']
"The Government therefore conclude that all of the applicant's complaints under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention should be deemed manifestly ill-founded, or that the case does not disclose a violation of the Convention.",argumentative,['all plaint article para']
