"It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"". The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"". The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.",argumentative,"['issue summarise paragraph', 'issue relate definition', 'company send to', 'removal flict definition', 'it prevent word', '<ORG> examine strand', 'strand include argument', 'term exclude intercourse', 'term exclude definition']"
"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37). It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above).",argumentative,"['it see number reason', 'number reason disagree company clusion', 'number inhibit they', 'number inhibit law fiction', 'number inhibit paragraph', 'which become law fiction', 'rapist remain rapist']"
"The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 14 and 20-25 above).",argumentative,"['case law development dismantle immunity', 'number see paragraph']"
"Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape.",argumentative,"['there be evolution', 'evolution treat company duct']"
"The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 32 above).",argumentative,"['applicant company victe rape', 'result not say object', 'number subject prosecution company viction']"
"What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom.",argumentative,[]
"Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to enquire into whether the facts in the applicant’s case were covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already made by the English courts before 12 November 1989. 44. In short, the Court, like the Government and the Commission, finds that the national courts’ decisions that the applicant could not invoke immunity",argumentative,"['fact ere exception', 'immunity rule make company', 'company rt decision', 'applicant company ld number invoke immunity']"
"(see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).",argumentative,[]
"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law",argumentative,[]
"The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency.",argumentative,"['guarantee enshrine article art', 'be occupy place']"
"It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment.",argumentative,['way provide safeguard']
"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy.",argumentative,"['Court hold Kokkinakis Greece judgment', 'it embody principle', 'it embody principle', 'law define crime', 'principle prescribe penalty', 'law strue detriment', 'law strue instance', 'law strue analogy']"
From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.,argumentative,['offence define law']
"(see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37)",argumentative,[]
"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability",argumentative,"['art speak law', 'Convention refer company cept', 'company cept use term', 'company prise law', 'law write law', 'company cept imply requirement', 'requirement number accessibility']"
"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition",argumentative,"['system include law', 'there be element']"
There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances.,argumentative,[]
From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.,argumentative,['offence define law']
"In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",argumentative,"['Court add act', 'Court add omission', 'individual know wording']"
"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability",argumentative,"['art speak law', 'Convention refer company cept', 'company cept use term', 'company prise law', 'law write law', 'company cept imply requirement', 'requirement number accessibility']"
"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances.",argumentative,"['system include law', 'there be element']"
"Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen. B. Application of the foregoing principles",argumentative,[]
"The issue was never resolved by the national courts, as the sole ground on which the applicant’s conviction rested was in fact the removal of the common law fiction by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.",argumentative,['issue never resolve removal']
"Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied.",argumentative,[]
"Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law.",argumentative,"['<ORG> create offence', 'they extend offence', 'they extend company duct', 'which exclude company mon law']"
They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes.,argumentative,"['company ld number say law', 'company ld number say kind']"
"To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent.",argumentative,[]
"Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred. In November 1989, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary.",argumentative,[]
"The applicant further argued that in examining his complaint under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention, the Court should not consider his conduct in relation to any of the exceptions to the immunity rule.",argumentative,"['Court number company sider', 'Court number relation']"
The Government and the Commission were of the view that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape.,argumentative,['there be doubt']
This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable.,argumentative,['there be indication']
"In particular, given the recognition of women’s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant.",argumentative,[]
He was not convicted of conduct which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was committed.,argumentative,[]
"In addition, the Government pointed out, on the basis of agreed facts Mr Justice Owen had found that there was an implied agreement between the applicant and his wife to separation and to withdrawal of the consent to intercourse.",argumentative,"['Government point applicant', 'Government point agreement', '<NAME> find applicant', '<NAME> find agreement', 'there be agreement', 'withdrawal send intercourse']"
The circumstances in his case were thus covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already stated by the English courts.,argumentative,"['circumstance ere exception', 'immunity rule state company']"
"A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity.",argumentative,['succession affirm principle']
"It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 12 November 1989 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted.",argumentative,[]
"The removal of the immunity by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991 and the House of Lords on 23 October 1991 occurred by way of direct reversal, not clarification, of the law. When the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 17 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed. On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon. In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created.",argumentative,"['removal occur way', '<ORG> debate Bill', 'advice await report', 'that abolish immunity', '<ORG> recommend exception', 'immunity maintain exception']"
"In 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word ""unlawful"" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 17 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect. On 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above).",argumentative,"['<ORG> have opportunity', 'opportunity take word', 'opportunity introduce provision']"
"However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal’s and the House of Lords’ rulings in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).",argumentative,['debate empte paragraph']
"The applicant maintained that the general common law principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife, albeit subject to certain limitations, was still effective on 12 November 1989, when he committed the acts which gave rise to the charge of attempted rape paragraph 10 above).",argumentative,"['husband company ld number find guilty', 'he mitte act', 'which give rise', 'which give paragraph']"
"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7)",argumentative,['Court hold Kokkinakis Greece judgment']
"is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy.",argumentative,"['it embody principle', 'it embody principle', 'law define crime', 'principle prescribe penalty', 'law strue detriment', 'law strue instance', 'law strue analogy']"
The Government and the Commission disagreed with the above contention.,non-argumentative,['Government disagree company tention']
"The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> sit accordance', 'chamber company pose judge']"
"The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (""the Commission"") on 9 September 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.",non-argumentative,"['case refer month period', 'month period lay article para']"
"It originated in an application (no. 20190/92) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr C.R., a British citizen, on 31 March 1992.",non-argumentative,"['it originate application number', 'it originate number', 'Ireland lodge article']"
"The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).",non-argumentative,['United Kingdom recognise jurisdiction']
The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention.,non-argumentative,['fact disclose breach']
"In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).",non-argumentative,"['enquiry make accordance', 'he wish part', 'he wish proceeding', 'who represent he']"
"On 24 September 1994 the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider both the instant case and the case of S.W. v. the United Kingdom",non-argumentative,"['President decide rule para', '<ORG> stitute company sider']"
"The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).",non-argumentative,['Chamber include <NAME>']
"On 24 September 1994, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr C. Russo, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr F. Bigi and Mr U. Lohmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr P. Jambrek, substitute judge, replaced Mr Macdonald, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).",non-argumentative,"['President draw name', 'President draw lot', '<NAME> replace <NAME>']"
"As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (""the Government""), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> sulte Agent', '<NAME> sulte applicants lawyer', '<NAME> sulte delegate', '<NAME> sulte rule para']"
"Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 5 April 1995 and the Government’s memorial on 6 April.",non-argumentative,"['order make company sequence', 'Registrar receive applicants memorial']"
On 17 May 1995 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to reply in writing.,non-argumentative,"['Secretary inform registrar', 'delegate wish writing']"
"In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 June 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.",non-argumentative,"['hearing take place', 'hearing take public', 'Court hold meeting']"
"The Court heard addresses by Mr Mucha, Mr Hill and Mr Moses and also replies to questions put by some of its members individually.",non-argumentative,"['Court hear address', 'question put member']"
"The applicant is a British citizen, born in 1952, and lives in Leicester.",non-argumentative,['citizen bear citizen']
The applicant married his wife on 11 August 1984.,non-argumentative,['applicant marry wife']
"They had one son, who was born in 1985.",non-argumentative,['they have son']
On 11 November 1987 the couple were separated for a period of about two weeks before becoming reconciled.,non-argumentative,['company ple separate period']
"On 21 October 1989, as a result of further matrimonial difficulties, his wife left the matrimonial home with their son and returned to live with her parents.",non-argumentative,"['wife leave home', 'wife leave son']"
She had by this time already consulted solicitors regarding her matrimonial affairs and had left a letter for the applicant in which she informed him that she intended to petition for divorce.,non-argumentative,"['she sulte solicitother', 'solicitother regard affair', 'she inform he', 'she intend divorce', 'letter petition divorce']"
However no legal proceedings had been taken by her before the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to criminal proceedings.,non-argumentative,"['proceeding take occurrence', 'which give rise', 'which give proceeding']"
"The applicant had on 23 October 1989 spoken to his wife by telephone indicating that it was his intention also to ""see about a divorce"".",non-argumentative,"['applicant speak wife', 'applicant speak telephone']"
He relied on a statement by Sir Matthew Hale CJ in his History of the Pleas of the Crown published in 1736:,non-argumentative,['he rely statement']
"But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.""",non-argumentative,"['wife give herself', 'wife give kind', 'wife give husband']"
In his judgment ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 747) Mr Justice Owen noted that it was a statement made in general terms at a time when marriage was indissoluble.,non-argumentative,"['statement make term', 'statement make time']"
Hale CJ had been expounding the common law as it seemed to him at that particular time and was doing it in a book and not with reference to a particular set of circumstances presented to him in a prosecution.,non-argumentative,"['<NAME> expound law', 'it seem time', 'set present prosecution']"
"The bald statement had been reproduced in the first edition of Archbold on Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice (1822, p. 259) in the following terms: ""A husband also cannot be guilty of rape upon his wife.""",non-argumentative,"['statement reproduce edition', 'statement reproduce term']"
"Mr Justice Owen further examined a series of court decisions (R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen’s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 113; R. v. Clarke [1949] 2 All England Law Reports 448; R. v. Miller [1954] 2 All England Law Reports 529; R. v. Reid [1972] 2 All England Law Reports 1350; R. v. O’Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663; R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22; R. v. Roberts [1986] Criminal Law Reports 188; see paragraphs 19-22 below), recognising that a wife’s consent to marital intercourse was impliedly given by her at the time of marriage and that the consent could be revoked on certain conditions.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> examine series', '<NAME> examine <ORG>', 'Criminal Appeal report <NAME>', 'wife company send intercourse', 'wife company give time', 'company send company ld', 'company send company dition']"
"However, I find it hard to ... believe that it ever was the common law that a husband was in effect entitled to beat his wife into submission to sexual intercourse ...",non-argumentative,[]
"If it was, it is a very sad commentary on the law and a very sad commentary upon the judges in whose breasts the law is said to reside.",non-argumentative,[]
"However, I will nevertheless accept that there is such an implicit consent as to sexual intercourse which requires my consideration as to whether this accused may be convicted for rape.""",non-argumentative,"['there be company', 'which require company sideration', 'accuse victe rape']"
"On the question of what circumstances would suffice in law to revoke the consent, Mr Justice Owen noted that it may be brought to an end, firstly, by a court order or equivalent.",non-argumentative,"['circumstance suffice law', 'circumstance suffice company', 'question revoke company', 'it bring end', 'it bring company rt order']"
"Secondly, he observed, it was apparent from the Court of Appeal’s judgment in the case of R. v. Steele ([1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22) that the implied consent could be withdrawn by agreement between the parties.",non-argumentative,['company ld withdraw agreement']
Such an agreement could clearly be implicit; there was nothing in the case-law to suggest the contrary.,non-argumentative,"['there be number hing', 'there be case law']"
"Thirdly, he was of the view that the common law recognised that a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse has been terminated, would amount to a revocation of the implicit consent.",non-argumentative,"['withdrawal accompany indication', 'company send intercourse', 'withdrawal amount revocation']"
He concluded that both the second and third exceptions to the matrimonial immunity against prosecution for rape applied in the case.,non-argumentative,['exception apply case']
"Following the judge’s ruling, the applicant pleaded guilty to attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.",non-argumentative,"['applicant plead rape', 'assault occasion harm']"
"The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, on the ground that Mr Justice Owen had made a wrong decision in law in ruling that a man may rape his wife when the consent to intercourse which his wife gave on entering marriage had been revoked neither by a court order nor by agreement between the parties.",non-argumentative,"['applicant appeal ground', '<NAME> make decision', '<NAME> make law', 'man rape wife', 'company send intercourse', 'wife give marriage', 'intercourse enter marriage', 'send revoke company rt order number', 'send revoke agreement']"
"On 14 March 1991 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division (Lord Lane CJ, Sir Stephen Brown P, Watkins, Neill and Russell LJJ), unanimously dismissed the appeal ([1991] 2 All England Law Reports 257).",non-argumentative,['Lord Lane CJ dismiss appeal']
Lord Lane noted that the general proposition of Sir Matthew Hale in his History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736) (see paragraph 11 above) that a man could not commit rape upon his wife was generally accepted as a correct statement of the common law at that epoch.,non-argumentative,"['proposition see paragraph', 'proposition accept statement', 'proposition accept epoch']"
"Further, Lord Lane made an analysis of previous court decisions, from which it appears that in R. v. Clarence (1888), the first reported case of this nature, some judges of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved had objected to the principle.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> make analysis', 'judge object principle']"
"In the next reported case, R. v. Clarke (1949), the trial court had departed from the principle by holding that the husband’s immunity was lost in the event of a court order directing that the wife was no longer bound to cohabit with him.",non-argumentative,"['trial company depart principle', 'husbands immunity lose event', 'wife bind abit']"
Almost every court decision thereafter had made increasingly important exceptions to the marital immunity (see paragraph 22 below).,non-argumentative,"['rt decision make exception', 'rt decision make paragraph']"
The Court of Appeal had accepted in R. v. Steele (1976) that the implied consent to intercourse could be terminated by agreement.,non-argumentative,"['company send to', 'send terminate agreement']"
"This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Roberts (1986), where it held that the lack of a non-molestation clause in a deed of separation, concluded on expiry of a non-molestation order, did not revive the consent to intercourse.",non-argumentative,"['separation company clude expiry', 'lack revive company', 'company send intercourse']"
Lord Lane added the following observations:,non-argumentative,['<NAME> add observation']
"Ever since the decision of Byrne J in R. v. Clarke in 1949, courts have been paying lip-service to Hale CJ’s proposition, whilst at the same time increasing the number of exceptions, the number of situations to which it does not apply.",non-argumentative,"['company rt pay service', 'company rt pay <ORG>']"
This is a legitimate use of the flexibility of the common law which can and should adapt itself to changing social attitudes.,non-argumentative,"['which adapt itself', 'which adapt attitude', 'flexibility change attitude']"
"There comes a time when the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further exceptions restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour.",non-argumentative,"['there e time', 'time create exception', 'exception restrict effect', 'proposition require examination', 'what regard behaviour']"
"It seems to us that where the common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is the true position of a wife in present-day society, the duty of the court is to take steps to alter the rule if it can legitimately do so in the light of any relevant parliamentary enactment.",non-argumentative,['it do light']
That in the end comes down to a consideration of the word ‘unlawful’ in the 1976 Act.,non-argumentative,[]
"Lord Lane then critically examined the different strands of interpretation of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" (see paragraph 17 below) excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> examine strand', 'strand include argument', 'term exclude intercourse', 'term exclude definition']"
He concluded:,non-argumentative,[]
... [W]e do not consider that we are inhibited by the 1976 Act from declaring that the husband’s immunity as expounded by Hale CJ no longer exists.,non-argumentative,['husbands immunity expound Hale CJ number']
"We take the view that the time has now arrived when the law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim.",non-argumentative,"['we take view', 'rapist remain rapist']"
"The Court of Appeal granted the applicant leave to appeal to the House of Lords, which unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment on 23 October 1991 ([1991] 4 All England Law Reports 481).",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> grant applicant', '<ORG> grant leave', 'which uphold judgment']"
"Lord Keith of Kinkel, joined by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Griffiths, Lord Ackner and Lord Lowry, gave, inter alia, the following reasons:",non-argumentative,['<NAME> give reason']
For over 150 years after the publication of Hale’s work there appeared to have been no reported case in which judicial consideration was given to his proposition.,non-argumentative,['company sideration give to']
"The first such case was R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen’s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 133 ...",non-argumentative,[]
It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded as an accurate statement of the common law of England.,non-argumentative,['proposition regard statement']
"The common law is, however, capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments.",non-argumentative,[]
Hale’s proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects at the time it was enunciated.,non-argumentative,['<NAME> reflect state']
"Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail.",non-argumentative,"['status change way', 'way go detail']"
"Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband.",non-argumentative,['marriage regard partnership']
Hale’s proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time.,non-argumentative,"['<NAME> involve company', 'wife give she', 'wife give company', 'company send intercourse', 'company send circumstance', 'company send state', 'she happen time', 'state feel time']"
In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.,non-argumentative,['person regard company ception']
The position then is that that part of Hale’s proposition which asserts that a wife cannot retract the consent to sexual intercourse which she gives on marriage has been departed from in a series of decided cases.,non-argumentative,"['wife not retract company', 'company send intercourse', 'she give marriage', 'part depart series']"
On grounds of principle there is no good reason why the whole proposition should not be held inapplicable in modern times.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'proposition hold inapplicable', 'proposition hold time']"
The only question is whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presents an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course.,non-argumentative,['section present obstacle']
The argument is that ‘unlawful’ in that subsection means outside the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,['unlawful mean bond']
"The fact is that it is clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent, and that the use of the word in the subsection adds nothing.",non-argumentative,['use add number hing']

"where there has been a decree of judicial separation or a decree nisi of divorce on the ground that ""between the pronouncement of decree nisi and the obtaining of a decree absolute a marriage subsists as a mere technicality"" (R. v. O’Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663);",non-argumentative,['marriage subsist technicality']

where no court order has been made:,non-argumentative,[]
"Mr Justice Lynskey observed, obiter, in R. v.

"Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane stated, obiter, in R. v. Steele that a separation agreement with a non-cohabitation clause would have that effect.",non-argumentative,['separation agreement have effect']
The Law Commission noted that it was stated in R. v. Miller and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Steele that lodging a petition for divorce would not be sufficient.,non-argumentative,[]
"It referred also to the ruling by Mr Justice Owen in the present case where an implied agreement to separate was considered sufficient to revoke the immunity and that, even in the absence of agreement, the withdrawal from cohabitation by either party, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, would operate to exclude the immunity.",non-argumentative,"['it refer ruling', 'case revoke immunity', 'withdrawal accompany indication', 'company send intercourse']"
"It found this view difficult to reconcile with the approach in Steele that filing a divorce petition was ""clearly"" not sufficient.",non-argumentative,['approach file divorce petition']
"The ruling in the present case appeared substantially to extend what had previously been thought to be the law, although it emphasised that factual separation, and not mere revocation of consent to intercourse, was necessary to remove the immunity.",non-argumentative,['company send to']
The Law Commission pointed out that its inquiry was unusual in one important respect.,non-argumentative,[]
"It was usual practice, when considering the reform of common law rules, to consider the grounds expressed in the cases or other authorities for the current state of the law, in order to analyse whether those grounds were well-founded.",non-argumentative,['ground express case']
"However, that step was of little assistance here, partly because there was little case-law on the subject but principally because there was little dispute that the reason set out in the authorities for the state of the law could not be supported (paragraph 4.1 of the Working Paper).",non-argumentative,"['there be case law', 'there be dispute', 'there be reason', 'reason set authority']"
The basis of the law was that intercourse against the wife’s actual will was excluded from the law of rape by the fictional deemed consent to intercourse perceived by Sir Matthew Hale in his dictum.,non-argumentative,"['intercourse exclude law', 'intercourse exclude company', 'company send intercourse', 'company perceive dictum']"
"This notion was not only quite artificial but, certainly in the modern context, was also quite anomalous.",non-argumentative,[]
"Indeed, it was difficult to find any current authority or commentator who thought that it was even remotely supportable.",non-argumentative,[]
The artificial and anomalous nature of the marital immunity could be seen if it was reviewed against the current law on the legal effects of marriage (paragraph 4.2).,non-argumentative,['it review law']
The concept of deemed consent was artificial because the legal consequences of marriage were not the result of the parties’ mutual agreement.,non-argumentative,[]
"Although the parties should have legal capacity to enter into the marriage contract and should observe the necessary formalities, they were not free to decide the terms of the contract; marriage was rather a status from which flow certain rights or obligations, the contents of which were determined by the law from time to time.",non-argumentative,"['party have capacity', 'capacity enter marriage company tract', 'status flow right', 'company tent determine law', 'company tent determine time']"
"This point had been emphasised by Mr Justice Hawkins in R. v.

"The more modern view of marriage is that it is a partnership of equals"" (paragraph 4.4).",non-argumentative,[]
It then gave examples of such changes in the law and added:,non-argumentative,['it give example']
"This gradual recognition of mutual rights and obligations within marriage, described in paragraphs 4.3-4.10 above, in our view demonstrates clearly that, whatever other arguments there may be in favour of the immunity, it cannot be claimed to be in any way justified by the nature of, or by the law governing, modern marriage.""",non-argumentative,"['right describe paragraph', 'right describe view', 'it not claim nature', 'law govern marriage']"
