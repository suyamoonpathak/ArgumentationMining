In estimating the importance to be given to the case in favour of disclosure there will be a wide spectrum within which the particular case must be located.,non-argumentative,"['importance give to', 'importance give favour']"
"If the party seeking disclosure shows, for example, that his very livelihood depends upon it, this will put the case near one end of the spectrum.",non-argumentative,"['party seek disclosure', 'party show example', 'this put case', 'this put end']"
"If he shows no more than that what he seeks to protect is a minor interest in property, this will put the case at or near the other end.",non-argumentative,"['he show number', 'this put case']"
On the other side the importance of protecting a source from disclosure in pursuance of the policy underlying the statute will also vary within a wide spectrum.,non-argumentative,"['importance protect source', 'importance protect disclosure', 'importance protect pursuance', 'policy underlie statute', 'importance vary spectrum']"
One important factor will be the nature of the information obtained from the source.,non-argumentative,['information obtain source']
"The greater the legitimate public interest in the information which the source has given to the publisher or intended publisher, the greater will be the importance of protecting the source.",non-argumentative,"['source give to', 'importance protect source']"
But another and perhaps more significant factor which will very much affect the importance of protecting the source will be the manner in which the information was itself obtained by the source.,non-argumentative,"['which affect importance', 'importance protect source', 'information obtain source']"
If it appears to the court that the information was obtained legitimately this will enhance the importance of protecting the source.,non-argumentative,"['it appear company', 'this enhance importance', 'importance protect source']"

"This threat, accurately described by Lord Donaldson of Lymington M.R. [1990] 2 W.L.R. 421, 439, as 'ticking away beneath them like a time bomb' can only be defused if they can identify the source either as himself the thief of the stolen copy of the plan or as a means to lead to the identification of the thief and thus put themselves in a position to institute proceedings for the recovery of the missing document.",non-argumentative,"['threat tick time bomb', 'they identify source', 'means lead identification', 'means put themselves', 'means put position', 'position institute proceeding']"
"The importance of protecting the source on the other hand is much diminished by the source's complicity, at the very least, in a gross breach of confidentiality which is not counterbalanced by any legitimate interest which publication of the information was calculated to serve.",non-argumentative,"['importance protect source', 'importance diminish source company plicity', 'importance diminish breach', 'number nterbalance interest']"
"Disclosure in the interests of justice is, on this view of the balance, clearly of preponderating importance so as to override the policy underlying the statutory protection of sources and the test of necessity for disclosure is satisfied ...""",non-argumentative,"['importance override policy', 'policy underlie protection']"
"Lord Templeman concurring also commented that the applicant ought to have ""recognised that (the information) was both confidential and damaging"".",non-argumentative,[]

The requirements of foreseeability were not satisfied in these circumstances.,non-argumentative,[]
"Further, while conceding that the order pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others, namely, X Ltd., the applicant considers that there was no pressing social need for the restraint, since X Ltd. was already protected by the injunction against leakage of confidential information.",non-argumentative,"['cede pursue aim', 'order pursue aim', 'aim protect right', 'there be need', 'applicant company sider protect injunction']"
"The restraint was also not proportionate to the aim, since it has cast a disproportionate chilling effect on the free flow of information generally.",non-argumentative,"['it cast effect', 'it cast flow']"

"He starts with the assumptions, first, that the protection of sources is itself a matter of high public importance, secondly, that nothing less than necessity will suffice to override it, thirdly, that the necessity can only arise out of concern for another matter of high public importance, being one of the four interests listed in the Section ...",non-argumentative,"['he start assumption', 'assumption suffice it', 'assumption override it', 'interest list section']"
