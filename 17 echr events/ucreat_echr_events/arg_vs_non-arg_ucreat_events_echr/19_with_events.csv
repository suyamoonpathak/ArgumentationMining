"However, they submitted that an advocate appearing before a court was a servant of justice and the alleged limitations on an advocate’s freedom of expression were not imposed by the impugned domestic law but derived from the very nature of his or her mission and function in the courtroom.",non-argumentative,['they submit limitation']
"The applicant submitted that Article 10 of the Convention applied to all forms of expression, including the expression of an advocate in court.",non-argumentative,"['Article apply form', 'form include expression']"

"The transcript of the proceedings could neither capture nor convey the tone in which the applicant had spoken, but he himself had been well aware of it.",non-argumentative,['transcript capture number']
It was highly formalistic to suggest that the allegation that “the tone of his voice as well as his demeanour and gestures to the Assize Court” had been “apparently aimed at creating a climate of intimidation and fear within the Court” constituted a separate allegation against the applicant.,non-argumentative,"['tone aim climate', 'allegation create climate', 'allegation create <ORG>', 'allegation stitute allegation']"
