There had in their contention not been any danger for them or their families.,argumentative,[]
"Moreover, the interrogation of the witnesses should in their contention not have taken place before the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['interrogation take place', 'interrogation take judge']"
"It would in their view have been feasible to have the police officers questioned in open court, wearing disguise if need be.",argumentative,[]
"In addition, the applicants considered that they had not had sufficient opportunity to challenge and question the police officers.",argumentative,"['applicants sidere opportunity', 'they have number', 'opportunity challenge opportunity', 'opportunity question police officer']"
They drew attention to the conditions under which the interrogation of the anonymous witnesses had taken place.,argumentative,"['they draw attention', 'they draw company dition', 'interrogation take place']"
"The anonymous police officers had been confined in a room with the investigating judge, separated from the applicants and their lawyers; it had not been possible for the applicants or their lawyers to discover whether there had been any other person in that room or what was going on there.",argumentative,"['police officer fine room', 'judge separate applicant', 'judge separate lawyer', 'applicant discover what']"
Not all the questions asked by the defence had been answered.,argumentative,['question ask defence']
"Finally, the applicants claimed that their conviction had been based ""to a decisive extent"" on the evidence given by anonymous witnesses.",argumentative,"['company viction base extent', 'company viction base evidence', 'evidence give witness']"
The only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal positively identifying the applicants had been that given by anonymous police officers.,argumentative,['evidence identify applicant']
"This was borne out by the fact that Mr Engelen, the one named witness who in the earlier stages of the proceedings had made statements incriminating one of the applicants, had not been granted anonymity and it had not been suggested that he had at any time been threatened.",argumentative,"['this bear fact', 'who make statement', 'statement incriminate one', '<NAME> grant anonymity']"
The applicants questioned the need to maintain the anonymity of the police officers at all.,argumentative,"['applicant question need', 'need maintain anonymity']"
"In the Court’s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State.",argumentative,"['favour maintain anonymity', 'balancing raise problem']"
"Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim.",argumentative,"['interest deserve protection', 'it recognise witness']"
They owe a general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.,argumentative,"['they owe duty', 'they owe authority', 'use resort circumstance']"
"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification.",argumentative,['need provide justification']
"In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court.",argumentative,"['case arrest officer', 'duty involve evidence']"
"On the other hand, the Court has recognised in principle that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities, for his own or his family’s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see the above-mentioned Lüdi judgment, p. 21, para. 49).",argumentative,"['Court recognise principle', 'police authority wish anonymity', 'police authority wish protection', 'agent deploy activity']"
"Having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary.",argumentative,"['right hold society', 'measure restrict right']"
If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.,argumentative,[]
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",argumentative,[]
"It has not been explained to the Court’s satisfaction why it was necessary to resort to such extreme limitations on the right of the accused to have the evidence against them given in their presence, or why less far-reaching measures were not considered.",argumentative,"['it explain <ORG>', 'evidence give presence']"
"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification.",argumentative,['need provide justification']
"In the present case, the police officers in question were in a separate room with the investigating judge, from which the accused and even their counsel were excluded.",argumentative,['judge accuse judge']
All communication was via a sound link.,argumentative,[]
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",argumentative,[]
It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993 (see paragraph 42 above) refers in this connection to the possibilities of using make-up or disguise and the prevention of eye contact.,argumentative,"['which become Act', 'memorandum refer company nection', 'memorandum refer possibility', 'possibility use make']"
Nor is the Court persuaded that the Court of Appeal made sufficient effort to assess the threat of reprisals against the police officers or their families.,argumentative,"['Court persuade police officer', '<ORG> make effort', 'effort assess threat']"
It does not appear from that court’s judgment that it sought to address the question whether the applicants would have been in a position to carry out any such threats or to incite others to do so on their behalf.,argumentative,"['it appear judgment', 'it seek question', 'position carry threat', 'position incite other', 'position incite behalf', 'position do behalf']"
Its decision was based exclusively on the seriousness of the crimes committed,argumentative,['decision base seriousness']
"In this connection, it is to be noted that Mr Engelen, a civilian witness who in the early stages of the proceedings had made statements identifying one of the applicants as one of the perpetrators, did not enjoy the protection of anonymity and it has not been claimed that he was at any time threatened.",argumentative,"['who make statement', 'statement identify one', 'statement identify perpetratother', '<NAME> enjoy protection']"
"It is true - as noted by the Government and the Commission (see paragraph 48 above) - that the anonymous police officers were interrogated before an investigating judge, who had himself ascertained their identity and had, in a very detailed official report of his findings, stated his opinion on their reliability and credibility as well as their reasons for remaining anonymous.",argumentative,"['police officer interrogate judge', 'who ascertain identity', 'judge state opinion']"
However these measures cannot be considered a proper substitute for the possibility of the defence to question the witnesses in their presence and make their own judgment as to their demeanour and reliability.,argumentative,"['measure not sidere possibility', 'defence question witness', 'defence question presence', 'possibility make judgment']"
It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.,argumentative,['handicap nterbalance procedure']
It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.,argumentative,['handicap nterbalance procedure']
"Moreover, the only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal which provided positive identification of the applicants as the perpetrators of the crimes were the statements of the anonymous police officers.",argumentative,['which provide identification']
"That being so the conviction of the applicants was based ""to a decisive extent"" on these anonymous statements.",argumentative,"['company viction base extent', 'company viction base statement']"
"In the Court’s view, the present case falls to be distinguished from that of Doorson: in the latter case it was decided on the basis of information contained in the case file itself that the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 - who were both civilians, and who knew the accused personally - had sufficient reason to believe that he might resort to violence, and they were heard in the presence of counsel (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, pp. 454-55, para. 25, pp. 455-56, para. 28, and pp. 470-71, paras. 71 and 73).",argumentative,"['it decide basis', '<ORG> taine case file', 'who know accuse', 'witness have reason', 'he resort violence', 'they hear presence']"
"In addition, in the latter case other evidence providing positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crimes charged was available from sources unrelated to the anonymous witnesses (ibid., pp. 458-59, para. 34, and p. 472, para. 76).",argumentative,['evidence provide identification']
Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.,argumentative,['proceeding take whole']
This is a borderline case.,argumentative,[]
"On the one hand, the conditions in which the trial took place and the witnesses were examined were certainly not entirely satisfactory and no doubt they could have been improved, although it has to be acknowledged that efforts had been made in Netherlands law to adapt the procedure for hearing anonymous witnesses to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as set out in the judgment of Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, Series A no. 166).",argumentative,"['trial take place', 'effort make Netherlands law', 'effort adapt procedure', 'effort adapt requirement', 'procedure hear witness', 'Series A number set judgment']"
"On the other hand, this was a case of armed robbery and it is understandable that the witnesses - even though they were police officers - should be in fear of reprisals from trigger-happy criminals.",argumentative,[]
"Were a similar situation to arise in the future, it would certainly be desirable for even more attention to be paid to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) when measures were taken.",argumentative,"['situation arise future', 'attention pay requirement']"
"In the instant case, however, having regard to all the circumstances, we are unable to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) and concur on the whole with the opinion of Judge van Dijk.",argumentative,[]
"I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d)).",argumentative,"['degree justify case', 'degree justify <NAME>', 'degree distinguish case', 'degree distinguish <NAME>', 'Netherlands find number', 'Netherlands find violation', 'Netherlands judgment act violation']"
"Even though the Court is not bound by precedent, legal certainty and legal equality require that the Court’s case-law be both consistent and transparent as well as reasonably predictable in so far as the facts of the case are comparable to those of earlier cases.",argumentative,['<ORG> bind precedent']
"Since ""the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (see the previously cited Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67), the applicable national legislation and case-law and the practice followed by the domestic courts are to some extent relevant also for the Court.",argumentative,"['company assess evidence', 'practice follow company rt']"
The Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment).,argumentative,"['<ORG> revise case law', '<ORG> revise view', 'case law cerne company dition', 'company viction base statement']"
"Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there).",argumentative,"['Netherlands Government propose legislature', 'legislature adopt amendment']"
The Act of 1993 was not yet in force when the judgments of the domestic courts in the present case were given.,argumentative,[]
"However, had it been in force, the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal would have been in conformity with the rules thereby introduced.",argumentative,[]
"It is true that the reasons listed in the Act for keeping the identity of a witness secret do not include the desirability, for tactical reasons, of not disclosing the identity of a police officer in order not to impair his future effectiveness.",argumentative,"['reason keep identity', 'reason keep secret', 'reason include desirability', 'number disclose identity', 'desirability impair effectiveness']"
The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).,argumentative,"['memorandum state word', 'interest investigate crime', 'interest justify company plete anonymity']"
"However, the Court of Appeal did not base its acceptance of the wish of the witnesses to remain anonymous on this reason, but on the fear of the witnesses for their lives and safety and those of their families (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment), which is a ground provided for in Article 226a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",argumentative,"['<ORG> base acceptance', '<ORG> base reason', 'those see paragraph', 'ground provide article']"
"The foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention.",argumentative,['foregoing do number']
"However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own.",argumentative,"['case law have relevance', 'legislation have relevance']"
"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law.",argumentative,['Strasbourg case law take account']
"Consideration of the various issues involved ultimately led me to the conclusion that Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) have not been violated in the present case.",argumentative,"['consideration lead I', 'consideration lead company clusion', 'number violate case']"
"It might have been preferable for the Court of Appeal or the investigating judge to have interrogated the witnesses in the presence of counsel and the Procurator General, the accused being able to follow the proceedings in a separate room.",argumentative,"['<ORG> interrogate witness', '<ORG> interrogate presence']"
I cannot discover from the case file that was before the Court whether this possibility was considered at all.,argumentative,['I not discover case file']
"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47).",argumentative,"['right examine witness', 'right limit extent', 'defence give opportunity', 'opportunity challenge opportunity', 'opportunity question witness', 'opportunity require article para']"
"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v.

"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['I sider procedure', 'procedure decide procedure', 'procedure follow judge']"
In reaching this conclusion I would stress the following aspects:,argumentative,['I stress aspect']
"The anonymous witnesses were not interrogated only by a prosecuting authority, but also by an independent and impartial judge who, judging from his official report of his findings to the Court of Appeal, took great care to compensate the defence for the handicap resulting from the lack of a face-to-face confrontation.",argumentative,"['witness interrogate authority', 'judge judge report', 'who take care', 'care pensate defence', 'handicap result lack']"
The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own.,argumentative,[]
"In these respects, as was also observed by the Commission, the present case differs from the cases of Kostovski (Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, para. 42), Windisch (Windisch v. Austria judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, p. 10, para. 27), Lüdi (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49), and Saïdi (Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, pp. 56-57, para. 44).",argumentative,['case differ case']
"The practice in cases such as the present of having witnesses heard by an investigating judge instead of by the trial court itself was accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment as being in conformity with the Convention (loc. cit., p. 471, para. 73).",argumentative,"['practice have practice', 'witness hear judge', 'practice accept <NAME>']"
The Court of Appeal has given reasons for delegating the hearing of the witnesses to the investigating judge.,argumentative,"['<ORG> give reason', 'reason delegate hearing', 'reason delegate judge']"
"The weight which the minority of the Commission laid on the fact that the Court of Appeal, being the trial court, did not avail itself of the possibility to assess for itself the reliability of the witnesses, is in my opinion not conclusive; there is no good reason why the court could not rely for this on the assessment of the equally independent and impartial investigating judge.",argumentative,"['minority lay fact', 'be avail itself', 'be avail possibility', 'possibility assess reliability', 'there be reason', 'rt company rely assessment']"
"In that respect, it is also of relevance that the interrogations before the investigating judge did not take place in a pre-trial phase but during a suspension of the trial before the Court of Appeal and pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal; they formed part of the trial.",argumentative,"['interrogation take place', 'interrogation take phase', 'they form part']"
"In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43).",argumentative,"['<ORG> emphasise importance', 'trial judge observe witness', 'one hear judge']"
"The statements made before the investigating judge were statements by witnesses who had been identified by the investigating judge as having been, at the relevant moment, sworn police officers who were authorised to perform prosecuting duties invested with investigative competence and were under oath in relation to any statement made in that context (see the Lüdi judgment previously cited p. 21, para. 49).",argumentative,"['statement make judge', 'who identify judge', 'who identify police officer', 'who authorise duty', 'police officer perform duty', 'statement make company text']"
"The investigating judge, who had observed the witnesses during the interrogations, gave a reasoned opinion as to their reliability; this was also intended to compensate the defence for being deprived of the visual information which would have permitted them to test the witnesses’ reliability (see the Windisch judgment previously cited, pp. 10-11, paras. 28-29).",argumentative,"['who observe witness', 'who observe interrogation', 'judge give opinion', 'this intend defence', 'defence deprive information', 'which permit they', 'which permit witnesses reliability', 'information test witnesses reliability']"
The investigating judge gave his reasoned opinion as to whether the wish of the police officers to remain anonymous was justified; these reasons were also found to be justified by the Court of Appeal on the grounds set out in its judgment.,argumentative,"['judge give opinion', 'reason find ground', 'opinion justify ground', 'ground set judgment']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['I sider procedure', 'procedure decide procedure', 'procedure follow judge']"
Their shared opinion that the accusations and events were such that fear of violent repercussions was not unsubstantiated cannot be considered unreasonable.,argumentative,[]
Article 6 (art. 6) does not guarantee an unlimited right to question witnesses.,argumentative,"['number guarantee right', 'right question witness']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['I sider procedure', 'procedure decide procedure', 'procedure follow judge']"
"It is necessary not only to recognise the discretion of the competent domestic court in maintaining conformity with the exigencies of the proper administration of justice, but also to balance the interests of the defence under Article 6 (art. 6) against the interests of witnesses protected by other substantive provisions of the Convention (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 70).",argumentative,"['discretion maintain company formity', 'discretion maintain exigency', 'witness protect provision']"
"Although in the Lüdi judgment (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49) the Court considered the interest of the police authorities in preserving the anonymity of their agents ""legitimate"", greater weight should be given in this case, as was done by the Court of Appeal, to the agents’ interest in the protection of their lives and safety and those of their families (Articles 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention) (art. 2, art. 3, art. 5, art. 8).",argumentative,"['<ORG> sidere interest', 'interest preserve anonymity', 'weight give case']"
"The defence were given ample opportunity to hear and question the witnesses, and to comment on the recording of their answers, and in fact made extensive use of that opportunity; the technical deficiencies complained of were inconvenient and might perhaps have been avoided, but, given especially the extensive time reserved for the hearings and the detailed way in which the statements were recorded, these deficiencies were not such as to hamper the defence to a significant extent.",argumentative,"['defence give opportunity', 'opportunity hear recording', 'opportunity question witness', 'time reserve hearing', 'number hamper defence', 'number hamper extent']"
"The Court of Appeal did not exclude beforehand the possibility that additional questions might be put to witnesses at the trial, but was of the opinion that the defence had insufficiently substantiated their wish to do so.",argumentative,"['<ORG> exclude possibility', 'question put witness', 'question put trial', 'defence substantiate wish']"
"Moreover, the defence were offered the possibility to challenge the statements and their use as evidence in open court before the Court of Appeal.",argumentative,"['defence offer possibility', 'possibility challenge statement', 'possibility challenge use']"
The convictions were not based solely upon the statements of anonymous witnesses.,argumentative,[]
"Although these were undoubtedly the core of the evidence, there were also statements by identified witnesses, there was some technical evidence and there was the recording of the telephone conversation.",argumentative,"['there be statement', 'there be evidence', 'there be recording']"
"In this respect, too, the Court should recognise that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"".",argumentative,[]
"In the Doorson judgment, in which the criterion of ""decisive extent"" was developed and applied (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), the Court found that this criterion had been met in a situation where the conviction was based, in addition to statements of anonymous witnesses, on a statement made by an identified witness to the police but retracted during the trial and a statement by an identified witness who disappeared before the defence had had the opportunity to question him (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76, in conjunction with pp. 458-59, para. 34).",argumentative,"['criterion develop <NAME>', 'Court find statement', 'Court find statement', 'criterion meet situation', 'company viction base addition', 'statement make witness', 'statement retract trial', 'defence have opportunity', 'opportunity question he']"
"In view of all these aspects of the case I come to the conclusion that the trial which led to the applicants’ conviction was ""fair"" in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as construed in the Court’s previous case-law.",argumentative,"['I company company clusion', 'which lead applicants company viction']"
"A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable.",argumentative,"['company sidere plex', 'position judge plex', 'position judge issue', 'which substitute judgment']"
From the wording of the Doorson judgment it is clear that in that case the Court recognised this primary responsibility of the national court.,argumentative,['Court recognise responsibility']
"The fact that police officers were fired at in pursuit does not necessarily mean that at a later stage, during or after the trial, their lives and safety and/or those of their families were in danger.",argumentative,['police officer fire pursuit']
"However, on both points the national authorities - in this case the national courts - should be left some latitude to balance the interests of the defence against those of the witnesses (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 71, where a reasonableness test was applied).",argumentative,"['latitude balance interest', 'latitude balance witness']"
In my opinion the Court of Appeal has not overstepped the mark in finding that the risk of disclosure of the identity of the witnesses was present and that their fear for their lives and safety or those of their families was justified in view of the seriousness of the crimes committed and the violence used.,argumentative,['<ORG> overstep mark']
"In the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., pp. 470-71, para. 71) the Court found that an actual threat against the witnesses was not required for the decision to maintain their anonymity to be reasonable, and that previous experience might be relevant.",argumentative,"['Court find experience', 'threat require experience', 'decision maintain anonymity']"
In the present case it should also be taken into consideration that some of the witnesses had been wounded while pursuing the robbers.,argumentative,['it take company sideration']
"Even if one were to take the position that a certain risk is implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve any less protection than that of other persons.",argumentative,"['that mean it', 'latter have risk', 'life deserve protection', 'safety deserve protection']"
"The ""general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities"" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection.",argumentative,['judgment owe policeman']
"Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned.",argumentative,['I not agree majority']
It cannot be denied - and indeed it has not been denied - that the possibilities for the defence to interrogate the witnesses were not without limitations.,argumentative,"['it not deny it', 'defence interrogate witness']"
"Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence.",argumentative,['identity know defence']
The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise.,argumentative,"['question answer witness', 'this accept judge', 'witness interrogate form']"
"However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be ""decisive"" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).",argumentative,"['<ORG> state judgment', 'argument advance witness', 'argument advance anonymity', 'argument claim anonymity', 'it sidere argument', 'argument cerne safety']"
"It may therefore be questioned whether it was necessary and proportionate to refuse to answer certain questions put by the defence in order to protect the anonymity of the witnesses and the secrecy of the police tactics.

The robbers then set the Mercedes car alight and made off in a BMW.,non-argumentative,"['robber set <ORG>', 'robber set alight']"
Police cars alerted by radio followed the BMW. Police officers saw the BMW drive onto a sand track leading into a nearby forest.,non-argumentative,"['police car alert radio', 'police car follow <ORG>', '<ORG> drive sand track', 'sand track lead forest']"
Later they saw a column of smoke coming out of the forest.,non-argumentative,[]

Four police officers in a police car saw a red car (later found to be a Lancia) leave the forest via the same sand track used by the BMW and gave chase.,non-argumentative,"['car leave forest', 'car leave sand track']"

"The applicants and one other man, called Amandus Pruijmboom (not to be confused with the applicant Antonius Amandus Pruijmboom), were charged with attempted murder - or, in the alternative, attempted manslaughter - and robbery with the threat of violence and summoned to appear for trial before the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) on 19 May 1989.",non-argumentative,"['man call <NAME>', '<NAME> fuse applicant', 'applicant charge murder', 'man charge murder']"

In interlocutory judgments of 2 June 1989 the Regional Court decided that it was necessary to establish whether the police officers identified only by numbers had investigative competence (opsporingsbevoegdheid).,non-argumentative,"['police officer identify number', 'police officer have company']"
To that end it referred the case to the investigating judge (rechter-commissaris) and adjourned the case until 20 July.,non-argumentative,"['it refer case', 'it refer judge']"
The investigating judge established that the police officers in question did in fact have investigative competence.,non-argumentative,['police officer have company petence']
"Counsel for Mr Willem Venerius argued, inter alia, that the police officers identified only by a number were anonymous witnesses, so that their statements did not constitute sufficient proof, in the absence of corroborating evidence, to support a conviction.",non-argumentative,"['police officer identify number', 'statement stitute proof', 'statement stitute absence', 'evidence support company viction']"
"The Regional Court rejected this argument, holding that since the police officers in question had investigative competence, the evidential value of their statements was not affected by their anonymity.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> reject argument', 'police officer have company petence']"
The Regional Court convicted the accused of attempted manslaughter and robbery with the threat of violence.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> victe accuse']

The five convicted men appealed to the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal (gerechtshof).,non-argumentative,[]
At the hearing before that court on 2 May 1990 the applicants’ lawyers made requests for several named and anonymous witnesses to be heard.,non-argumentative,"['applicants lawyer make request', 'witness name witness']"
"The Court of Appeal thereupon referred the case to the investigating judge, firstly because it considered it necessary to find out what objections the police officers themselves had against the lifting of their anonymity and secondly because the number of persons to be heard was such that it could not conveniently be done in open court.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> refer case', '<ORG> refer judge', 'police officer have lifting']"
"The persons to be heard were four named police officers, eleven anonymous police officers (identified to the defence and the court only by a number) and two civilians.",non-argumentative,"['police officer identify defence', 'police officer identify number', 'police officer identify company']"
The named and anonymous witnesses were questioned on 24 and 27 September and on 5-8 and 13 November 1990.,non-argumentative,['witness name witness']
All of the anonymous witnesses were - or had at the relevant time been - police officers invested with investigative competence.,non-argumentative,[]
"The procedure followed for questioning them was that the investigating judge, the witness and a registrar were together in one room, and the defendants, their lawyers and the advocate-general in another.",non-argumentative,['procedure question they']
"The defendants, the lawyers and the advocate-general could hear all the questions asked to the witnesses and their replies through a sound link.",non-argumentative,"['defendant hear question', 'defendant hear sound link', 'defendant hear reply', 'question ask to']"
"The statements of the witnesses were repeated by the investigating judge to the registrar, who took them down.",non-argumentative,"['statement repeat judge', 'statement repeat registrar', 'who take they']"

"Witness 001 confirmed a statement which he had made earlier, to the effect that when confronted with Mr van Mechelen through a two-way mirror he had identified him as the man who had sat next to the driver of the Lancia.",non-argumentative,"['witness company firm statement', 'company front way mirror', 'he identify he', 'he identify man']"
Witness BRZ03 was interrogated the same day.,non-argumentative,[]
His wish to remain anonymous was primarily inspired by the wish to ensure the safety of his family and friends; he had been threatened in the past.,non-argumentative,"['wish inspire wish', 'wish ensure safety', 'he threaten past']"
At the time of the crimes in question he had been a member of an arresting team.,non-argumentative,[]

"He considered them all reliable, although they had shown great caution when asked questions which might affect their anonymity.",non-argumentative,"['they show caution', 'which affect anonymity']"
He also considered their reasons for wishing to remain anonymous well-founded.,non-argumentative,['he sidere reason']
"Also on 27 September 1990 the investigating judge interrogated, in addition to two named police officers, the named witness Mr Engelen. Mr Engelen was a civilian bystander who stated that he had seen a man fire a gun.",non-argumentative,"['judge interrogate addition', 'man fire gun']"
He had later identified Mr van Mechelen as that man when confronted with him through a two-way mirror.,non-argumentative,"['he identify <NAME>', 'he identify man', 'company front way mirror']"
On 3 October 1990 the Court of Appeal resumed the hearing.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> resume hearing']
The lawyer defending Mr Willem Venerius asked for one anonymous police officer - BRZ03 - to be heard in open court.,non-argumentative,['lawyer defend <NAME>']
The Court of Appeal however decided not to continue its own examination of the case until all witnesses had been questioned by the investigating judge.,non-argumentative,"['<ORG> decide number', 'witness question judge']"
On 5 November the investigating judge resumed the interrogation of the witnesses.,non-argumentative,['judge resume interrogation']

Witness 005 was also a member of an observation team.,non-argumentative,[]
He had been a passenger in a police car which had passed the Lancia and had recognised Mr Johan Venerius as the driver.,non-argumentative,['which pass Lancia']
Witness 003 had been a member of an observation team at the relevant time.,non-argumentative,[]
He wished to remain anonymous in the interests of the service as well as for the safety of his family.,non-argumentative,"['he wish interest', 'he wish safety']"

"The driver on both occasions had been the applicant Pruijmboom, whom he had later recognised at a confrontation.",non-argumentative,['he recognise company frontation']
Witness 46203 had been a member of the same arresting unit.,non-argumentative,[]
"He was ""99% certain"" that he had seen Mr van Mechelen enter the caravan site about an hour before the three cars left from there.",non-argumentative,['<NAME> enter caravan site']
Witness BRZ08 had left the police force but at the relevant time had been a member of an arresting team.,non-argumentative,['<NAME> leave police force']
"He wished to remain anonymous for the safety of his family, three of his colleagues having been threatened in the past.",non-argumentative,['he wish safety']
He had been the driver of the police car which had pursued the Lancia and had been fired at.,non-argumentative,['which pursue Lancia']
"He had sustained injuries, as had the other police officers in the car.",non-argumentative,['he sustain injury']
The various named police officers provided background information relating to the investigation and the procedures followed but did not positively identify any of the applicants as the perpetrators.,non-argumentative,"['police officer provide background information', 'background information relate investigation', 'background information relate procedure']"
Some of them stated that they knew of colleagues who had been threatened in other cases but none of them had yet been threatened in this case.,non-argumentative,"['some state number', 'they know company league', 'who threaten case', 'number threaten case']"
"The cases against: Willem Venerius, Johan Venerius, Hendrik van Mechelen, Amandus Pruijmboom, and Antonius Amandus Pruijmboom were referred by the Court of Appeal at ‘s-Hertogenbosch to myself, A.H.L. Roosmale Nepveu, investigating judge with responsibility for criminal cases at the Regional Court of ‘s-Hertogenbosch. I, investigating judge, wish to place the following on record in connection with the investigation conducted by myself with the assistance of the registrar.",non-argumentative,"['case refer judge', 'judge wish follow', 'judge wish record', 'judge wish company nection', 'judge wish assistance']"

"I also, together with the registrar, drew up a record of the hearing for each accused separately.",non-argumentative,['I draw record']
"The statements of the witnesses are however similar in all cases, since the hearings took place simultaneously in all five cases.",non-argumentative,"['hearing take place', 'hearing take case']"
Thus in the statements the names of fellow accused and their counsel appear as ‘persons asking questions’.,non-argumentative,"['name appear person', 'person ask question']"
"The accused, their counsel and the advocate-general were always invited to the hearings.",non-argumentative,['accuse invite hearing']
Whenever they appeared they were also given an opportunity to ask questions.,non-argumentative,"['they give opportunity', 'opportunity ask question']"
They did so extensively.,non-argumentative,[]
The hearings took up a great deal of time.,non-argumentative,['hearing take deal']
The shortest hearing of an unidentified witness lasted nearly two hours (46203); the longest about five hours (BRZ08).,non-argumentative,[]
The hearings of witnesses Jansen and Koene each lasted a good five hours.,non-argumentative,[]
"This information may perhaps be of use in assessing the suggestion that was made on 3 October 1990 to the Court of Appeal, that all the witnesses should be heard by the Court in a single day.",non-argumentative,"['that make to', 'witness hear day']"
"Where a witness did not answer a question, this is also indicated in the text of his statement.",non-argumentative,"['witness answer question', 'this indicate text']"
"The statements were recorded in very great detail and in fact cover all the matters raised - also by the defence -, in a factual and where necessary even literal transcript.",non-argumentative,"['statement record detail', 'statement record company', 'matter raise defence', 'matter raise transcript']"
"And even if ... there are drawbacks to the manner in which the hearings of the unidentified witnesses were carried out, it is my belief that the advocate-general and the defence had sufficient opportunity to question the witnesses thoroughly at the hearings.",non-argumentative,"['there be drawback', 'advocate general have opportunity', 'defence have opportunity', 'opportunity question witness', 'opportunity question hearing']"
Those present really did have the opportunity for hours on each occasion.,non-argumentative,"['those have opportunity', 'those have hour', 'those have occasion']"
"If they so desired, those present had several chances to put questions to a witness.",non-argumentative,"['those have chance', 'chance put question', 'chance put witness']"
"Unlike what normally happens at court hearings, everyone was able to follow the entire transcription of the statements and then still obtain clarifications and additions.",non-argumentative,"['number happen company rt hearing', '<NAME> happen company rt hearing']"
"Questions were barred only on substantive grounds (see the records for details), not by reason of the time taken for the interrogations.",non-argumentative,"['question bar ground', 'time take interrogation']"
"In the light of recent case-law in the matter of statements by unidentified witnesses, I think it is right for me to make known my findings regarding the statements of the unidentified witnesses heard in this case.",non-argumentative,"['finding regard statement', 'witness hear case']"
"I, the investigating judge, and the registrar, are the only persons who attended all the hearings from start to finish.",non-argumentative,"['who attend hearing', 'who attend start']"
I stand by my official record of findings dated 27 September 1990 where the witnesses referred to in it are concerned [see paragraph 18 above].,non-argumentative,"['I stand record', 'record see paragraph']"
I would now add the following:,non-argumentative,['I add follow']
All the ‘numbered witnesses’ made their identities known to me.,non-argumentative,['identity know I']
It was clear to me that all eleven were different persons.,non-argumentative,[]
Their statements indicated such a knowledge of the facts that I am entirely convinced that I was talking to the witnesses referred to by numbers in the documents.,non-argumentative,"['statement indicate knowledge', 'I talk witness', 'witness refer number']"
"On the contrary, each and every one of them was very much to the point.",non-argumentative,[]
The persons facing me wore serious expressions.,non-argumentative,"['person face I', 'person wear expression']"
"The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake, especially for the accused persons involved.",non-argumentative,[]
"The calm, quiet manner in which, for example, BRZ03 and BRZ08 related their experiences in Leende (in which connection I expressly leave it to the Court of Appeal to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> relate experience', 'I leave it']"
"All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness, which, in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [two of the defence lawyers] in particular, did not bother me.",non-argumentative,"['witness manifest degree', 'which bother I']"
"If all the statements are laid side by side, some differences of detail can be observed.",non-argumentative,[]
I do not think that these differences are such as to warrant the conclusion that the witnesses may be unreliable.,non-argumentative,[]
"Rather, in so far as I have observed any differences, I would describe them rather as the ‘extraneous noise’ which in my experience practically always affects statements by witnesses.",non-argumentative,"['I observe difference', 'I describe they', 'I describe number', 'which affect statement']"
Of course it is ultimately for the Court of Appeal to decide on the value of the statements.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> decide value']
The reasons for the witnesses wishing to remain anonymous in the instant case are given in the records of the hearings.,non-argumentative,"['witness wish instant case', 'reason remain instant case', 'reason give record']"
It seems to me that I am now affording the Court an opportunity to reflect on the value of those arguments.,non-argumentative,"['it seem I', 'number afford <ORG>', 'number afford opportunity', 'opportunity reflect value']"
"I think that the text of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands also compels me, as the judge conducting the questioning, to state my opinion on the reasons given by the witnesses for remaining anonymous.",non-argumentative,"['text pel I', 'text pel judge company', 'judge company ducte questioning', 'reason give witness']"
I am also concerned to inform the Court of Appeal that I am aware that the Court is called to take the final decision in these matters.,non-argumentative,[]
I consider the reasons behind the desire to remain anonymous to be such as fully to justify anonymity.,non-argumentative,['reason justify anonymity']
I have had regard in this connection to the nature of these cases and to the nature of the activities of the anonymous witnesses concerned.,non-argumentative,"['I have regard', 'I have company', 'I have nection']"
I take the liberty of observing - while expressly leaving aside the question whether these accused persons are the perpetrators - that the instant case tellingly illustrates the fact that there are evidently people for whom human lives do not count when it comes to evading responsibility for exceptionally serious crimes which they may have committed.,non-argumentative,"['I take liberty', 'liberty leave question', 'instant case illustrate fact', 'there be people', 'life number company nt', 'life number responsibility', 'people evade responsibility']"
"I can understand that there are major objections to revealing the names and appearance of members of arresting teams, observation teams and arresting units to the public at large.",non-argumentative,"['I understand name', 'I understand team observation team', 'there be objection', 'objection reveal name', 'objection reveal public', 'objection reveal appearance']"
By that I mean that the obvious interest of society in having very serious crimes solved should weigh in the balance.,non-argumentative,['interest weigh balance']
"At the same time, I am of the opinion that the conduct of the unidentified witnesses (who are no longer anonymous to myself) who have appeared in this case is the subject of proper judicial supervision.",non-argumentative,['who appear case']
It is not apparent to me as investigating judge that the ‘numbered witnesses’ acted carelessly.,non-argumentative,[]
"Rather, in my opinion, the opposite was true.",non-argumentative,[]
"During the last hearing of the witness Koene, [two of the defence lawyers] asked me to record that, in their view, the witness answered not only the questions of the defence but also questions by the investigating judge in a ponderous, deliberate manner that was hard to follow.",non-argumentative,"['two ask I', 'witness answer question', 'witness answer manner']"
I have been asked to endorse that opinion.,non-argumentative,['I ask opinion']
I decline to do so.,non-argumentative,[]
"The witness Koene was wary in his answers, which I find understandable in view of the barrage of questions - which were not always formulated equally clearly.",non-argumentative,[]
"It must not be forgotten that a witness who is being questioned on oath about a multitude of events that occurred some years previously should not be reproached for failing, in his answers to those questions, to keep up with the tempo of the rather forceful questioning to which [the two lawyers] in particular subjected him on 8 November 1990, together and in tandem.",non-argumentative,"['who question oath', 'who question multitude', 'lawyer subject he', 'lawyer subject tandem']"
"Furthermore, I can imagine that a witness may be somewhat annoyed if he is repeatedly asked the same question, especially if he has already replied under oath on the day before.",non-argumentative,"['he ask question', 'he reply oath', 'he reply day']"
"The witness Koene kept a cool head, and in so doing demonstrated a certain quality.",non-argumentative,['witness keep company head']
"As far as I can judge at the present time, I regard him as a reliable witness.",non-argumentative,"['I judge time', 'I regard he', 'I regard witness']"
"Nor do I think that he can be regarded as a reluctant witness, if only by reason of his extensive statements in the records of 7 November and 8 November 1990.",non-argumentative,"['I think record', 'he regard witness']"
The witness Koene informed me on 15 November 1990 that on 26 January 1989 the persons numbered BRZ05 and BRZ14 were in the car with BRZ10.,non-argumentative,"['witness inform I', 'witness inform number ember', 'person number <NAME>']"
He gave me this information following a request by the defence.,non-argumentative,"['he give I', 'he give information']"
"In my judgment, Mr Engelen is a simple, friendly and very obliging man.",non-argumentative,[]
"Perhaps I can illustrate the impression I had of him by recording that, after the interrogation had gone on for a considerable time, I thought it opportune to ask the unusual question whether the witness could read.",non-argumentative,"['I illustrate impression', 'interrogation go time']"
I do not exclude the possibility that he is not entirely aware of the great importance of an exact and consistent account of what he saw.,non-argumentative,['I exclude possibility']
"In the second paragraph on the first page of the statement by the witness Engelen, I suggested to him that the confrontation had occurred on 15 February 1989.",non-argumentative,[]
The date should be 9 March 1989. [One of the defence lawyers] pointed this out to me later and I think he is right.,non-argumentative,"['one point this', 'one point I']"
"The hearing before the Court of Appeal was resumed on 16, 17 and 18 January 1991.",non-argumentative,[]
"On 16 January a named witness, Mr Engelen, was heard in open court.",non-argumentative,[]
"He had stated to the police in March 1989, and to the investigating judge in September 1990, that he recognised the applicant Van Mechelen as the man who had fired a sub-machine gun at a police car in the village of Leende.",non-argumentative,"['he state police', 'he recognise applicant', 'he recognise man', 'who fire sub machine gun', 'who fire police car', 'who fire village']"
"Before the Court of Appeal he stated that on the latter occasion he had been allowed to re-read his earlier statement, but that he was no longer sure whether he could still recognise either the weapon or the man who had fired it.",non-argumentative,"['he state he', 'he allow statement', '<ORG> recognise weapon', 'who fire it']"
He also said that he had not been threatened in connection with the case.,non-argumentative,['he threaten company nection']
"On 18 January the lawyer acting for the applicant Van Mechelen brought forward two persons chosen for their excellent eyesight (both having participated in the Olympic games as members of the Netherlands rifle-shooting team), and who had participated in a reconstruction of the shooting in light and weather conditions similar to those obtaining at the time of the crime.",non-argumentative,"['lawyer act applicant', 'lawyer bring person', 'person choose eyesight', 'both participate game', 'both participate member', 'who participate reconstruction', 'company dition obtain time']"
These witnesses both stated that they had been unable to distinguish the features of the persons acting the parts of the perpetrators at the distances at which it had been alleged that the accused had been seen by Mr Engelen.,non-argumentative,['person act part']

dissenting opinion of Mr van Dijk.,non-argumentative,[]
To my regret I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 in conjunction with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d). Nor can I follow the majority as regards the essence of the reasoning supporting that conclusion.,non-argumentative,"['I follow majority', 'reasoning support company clusion']"
"Although the Court’s case-law has not yet been fully developed as to the conditions subject to which a conviction in criminal proceedings may be based partly on statements of anonymous witnesses, the Court has drawn certain lines.",non-argumentative,"['company viction base statement', 'Court draw line']"
"Having stated my conclusion I wish, with due respect, to make the following observations with regard to the reasoning on which the majority bases its conclusion.",non-argumentative,"['I wish observation', 'majority base company clusion']"
"Like the majority, and in accordance with the case-law of the Court, I take as my starting-point that evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing.",non-argumentative,"['I take starting point', 'evidence produce hearing']"
"Therefore, I find in the abstract that interrogation of the police officers at the trial before the Court of Appeal, in disguise if necessary to protect their anonymity, would have been preferable.",non-argumentative,"['I find abstract', 'interrogation protect anonymity']"
"However, I also take note of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that this would have been too risky because disclosure of the identity of the witnesses could not have been excluded.",non-argumentative,['I take number']
I would have preferred it if the Court of Appeal had given concrete arguments for that opinion.,non-argumentative,"['I prefer it', '<ORG> give company argument']"
"On the other hand, I lack the expertise - as, I assume, do my colleagues in the Court - to judge whether its fear was justified or not.",non-argumentative,"['I lack expertise', 'I assume company league', 'expertise do company league', 'company league judge company league', 'fear justify company league']"
"Then again, one may well wonder whether the defence would have been in a better position to observe the witnesses’ demeanour and test their reliability had they appeared in disguise, given the fact that an effective disguise may also substantially disguise the sound and intonation of the voice and the body language of the person concerned.",non-argumentative,"['one wonder position', 'one wonder sound', 'one wonder voice', 'position observe witnesses demeanour', 'position test reliability', 'they appear disguise', 'disguise disguise sound', 'disguise disguise intonation']"
I disagree with the majority that the Court of Appeal failed to make any real effort to assess the threat of reprisals.,non-argumentative,"['I disagree majority', '<ORG> fail effort', 'effort assess threat']"
"The Court of Appeal had at its disposal the report of findings of the investigating judge, in which the latter referred not only to the statements made on this subject by the police officers concerned - which were in some cases supported by previous experience (paragraphs 17 and 21 of the judgment) - but also gave his own evaluation, based upon the seriousness of the crimes and the violence used by the perpetrators.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> have report', '<ORG> have disposal', 'latter refer number', 'latter refer statement', 'statement make subject', 'statement make police officer company', 'which support experience paragraph', 'evaluation base seriousness', 'violence use perpetratother']"
"Given these reasoned opinions of both the investigating judge and the Court of Appeal, the latter of which was reviewed by the Supreme Court, the Government were not called upon to give an explanation of their own, as held by the majority (see paragraph 60 of the judgment); nor in my opinion would the Government have been in a position to do so.",non-argumentative,[]
"The fact that Mr Engelen, who had originally made a highly incriminating statement, was not granted anonymity by the police and nevertheless did not suffer any harm at the hands of the applicants cannot be decisive in this context.",non-argumentative,"['who make statement', '<NAME> grant anonymity', '<NAME> grant police', 'fact suffer harm', 'fact suffer hand']"
"The police may have made a mistake in his case by revealing his identity, but in any case later events do not automatically and retrospectively invalidate a reasonable assessment of a risk.",non-argumentative,"['police make mistake', 'police make case', 'police make identity']"
One can hardly blame a witness who expresses serious fears for not waiting until something serious happens to him or any other witness; the only criterion for the national court to consider is the reasonableness of the fear.,non-argumentative,"['one blame witness', 'who express fear', 'something happen number waiting']"
I fail to see why policemen should be under a special duty to give evidence in open court (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) since this is a general civic duty prescribed by law.,non-argumentative,"['duty give evidence', 'duty give paragraph', 'duty prescribe law']"
"And even if one may agree that the use of policemen as anonymous witnesses ""should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances"" (ibid.), one may argue on the other hand that their anonymity should meet with fewer objections from the point of view of the defence, because their statements are statements by sworn professionals, whose identity and investigative competence can easily be checked by the investigating judge.",non-argumentative,"['use resort circumstance', 'one argue hand', 'anonymity meet objection', 'identity check judge', 'company petence check judge']"
"The majority also deal with the question whether ""operational needs"" provided sufficient justification for preserving the anonymity of the police officers.",non-argumentative,"['majority deal question', 'need provide justification', 'justification preserve anonymity']"
Reference is made in that context to the explanatory memorandum of the Act of 11 November 1993 in which the Netherlands Government indicate that in their opinion that interest can be sufficiently protected by less far-reaching restrictions on the rights of the defence.,non-argumentative,"['reference make company text', 'interest protect restriction']"
"On the whole, in my opinion, neither the limitations necessitated by the situation nor those accepted by the investigating judge were such as to warrant the finding that there was no ""adequate and proper opportunity to question the witnesses"" as required by the Court in its Kostovski judgment (loc. cit., p. 20, para. 41).",non-argumentative,"['limitation necessitate situation', 'limitation accept judge', 'there be opportunity', 'opportunity question witness', 'opportunity require <NAME>']"
"The handicaps under which the defence laboured were, therefore, sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the Kostovski judgment previously cited, p. 21, para. 43, and the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 472, para. 76).",non-argumentative,"['handicap nterbalance procedure', 'procedure follow authority', '<NAME> cite para']"
"Finally, although the statements of the anonymous witnesses were an essential part of the evidence, it cannot be said that the convictions were based solely on these statements.",non-argumentative,['company viction base statement']
"Whether they were based on these statements ""to a decisive extent"", as the majority holds (paragraph 63 of the judgment), is hard to say.",non-argumentative,"['they base statement', 'they base extent', 'majority hold paragraph']"
"I share the opinion expressed by the Delegate of the Commission at the Court’s hearing that this criterion, laid down in the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), is difficult to apply, because if the testimony of anonymous witnesses is used by the court as part of the evidence, that will always be because the court considers it a ""decisive"" part of that evidence, making the proof complete or at least sufficient.",non-argumentative,"['I share opinion', 'opinion express <ORG>', 'testimony use part']"
"Here again, the Court’s finding that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (paragraph 50 of the present judgment) should prevail.",non-argumentative,[]
"Moreover, as already mentioned (see paragraph 3 (h) above), in this respect the facts of the case would not seem to differ substantially from those of the Doorson case.",non-argumentative,[]
