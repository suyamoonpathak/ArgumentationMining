"According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that ""due regard"" should be had to ""the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention"".",argumentative,['balance envisage clause']
"The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that ""[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred"" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression.",argumentative,"['clause introduce drafting stage', 'state party declare offence', 'idea base superiority', 'company ld give rise', 'company ld give difficulty']"
"In the applicant’s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers’ Deputies on 31 October 1968).",argumentative,"['they add statement', 'they add instrument']"
"The applicant and the Commission emphasised that, taken in the context of the broadcast as a whole, the offending remarks had the effect of ridiculing their authors rather than promoting their racist views.",argumentative,"['applicant emphasise effect', 'remark have effect', 'effect ridicule authother', 'effect promote view']"
"The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia.",argumentative,"['it seek attention', 'it seek matter']"
"The applicant had deliberately included the offensive statements in the programme, not with the intention of disseminating racist opinions, but in order to counter them through exposure.",argumentative,"['applicant include statement', 'applicant include programme number', 'applicant include intention', 'intention disseminate opinion']"
"The applicant pointed out that he tried to show, analyse and explain to his viewers a new phenomenon in Denmark at the time, that of violent racism practised by inarticulate and socially disadvantaged youths.",argumentative,['racism practise youth']
"Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the ""reputation or rights of others"".",argumentative,"['he sidere reputation', 'broadcast company ld number have effect']"
The interests in protecting the latter were therefore outweighed by those of protecting the applicant’s freedom of expression.,argumentative,"['interest protect latter', 'interest outweigh applicants', 'interest outweigh freedom']"
since under the Act it is in principle only the author of a punishable statement who may be liable.,argumentative,[]
In addition the applicant alleged that had the 1991 Media Liability Act been in force at the relevant time he would not have faced prosecution,argumentative,['he face prosecution']
The Government contended that the applicant had edited the Greenjackets item in a sensationalist rather than informative manner and that its news or information value was minimal.,argumentative,"['<ORG> tend value', 'applicant edit <ORG>', 'applicant edit manner']"
Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast.,argumentative,['majority view news programme']
"Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme.",argumentative,"['they incur liability', 'applicant encourage <ORG>', 'applicant encourage statement']"
It was too subtle to assume that viewers would not take the remarks at their face value.,argumentative,"['viewer take remark', 'viewer take face value']"
"No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints,",argumentative,"['weight company attach fact', 'programme give rise', 'programme give company plaint']"
"The applicant had thus failed to fulfil the ""duties and responsibilities"" incumbent on him as a television journalist.",argumentative,"['applicant fail duty', 'applicant fail responsibility']"
"since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining.",argumentative,[]
"No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints,",argumentative,"['weight company attach fact', 'programme give rise', 'programme give company plaint']"
The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences,argumentative,[]
it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated.,argumentative,"['it have effect', 'reminder take reminder']"
and was therefore not likely to deter any journalist from contributing to public discussion on racism and xenophobia;,argumentative,['company tribute discussion']
"It may be true, as has been suggested by the applicant, that as a result of recent events the awareness of the dangers of racial discrimination is sharper today than it was a decade ago, at the material time.",argumentative,[]
"Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965.",argumentative,[]
"Consequently, the object and purpose pursued by the UN Convention are of great weight in determining whether the applicant’s conviction, which - as the Government have stressed - was based on a provision enacted in order to ensure Denmark’s compliance with the UN Convention, was ""necessary"" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",argumentative,"['which base provision', 'provision enact order']"
"(see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, para. 57).",argumentative,[]
"In this context the Court recalls that Article 10 (art. 10) protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed",argumentative,[]
"Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court’s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas.",argumentative,"['obligation take measure', 'measure eliminate form', 'measure prevent doctrine', 'measure prevent practice', 'company sidere whole', 'item appear point', 'item appear propagation', 'item appear purpose']"
The national courts laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had himself taken the initiative of preparing the Greenjackets feature and that he not only knew in advance that racist statements were likely to be made during the interview but also had encouraged such statements.,argumentative,"['company lay emphasis', 'company lay fact', 'applicant take initiative', 'initiative prepare Greenjackets feature', 'he know advance', 'fact make interview', 'fact encourage statement']"
He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions.,argumentative,"['he edit programme', 'he edit way', 'way include assertion']"
"Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above).",argumentative,['remark disseminate circle']
The Court is satisfied that these were relevant reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).,argumentative,[]
"On the other hand, as to the contents of the Greenjackets item, it should be noted that the TV presenter’s introduction started by a reference to recent public discussion and press comments on racism in Denmark, thus inviting the viewer to see the programme in that context.",argumentative,['tv presenter introduction start reference']
"He went on to announce that the object of the programme was to address aspects of the problem, by identifying certain racist individuals and by portraying their mentality and social background.",argumentative,[]
There is no reason to doubt that the ensuing interviews fulfilled that aim.,argumentative,"['there be number reason', 'interview fulfil aim']"
"Taken as a whole, the feature could not objectively have appeared to have as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas.",argumentative,"['company ld number appear propagation', 'company ld number appear purpose']"
"On the contrary, it clearly sought - by means of an interview - to expose, analyse and explain this particular group of youths, limited and frustrated by their social situation, with criminal records and violent attitudes, thus dealing with specific aspects of a matter that already then was of great public concern.",argumentative,"['it seek mean', 'youth limit youth', 'youth frustrate situation', 'youth frustrate record', 'youth frustrate attitude']"
The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above).,argumentative,['number justify dissemination']
"However, in view of the principles stated in paragraph 31 above, the Court sees no cause to question the Sunday News Magazine staff members’ own appreciation of the news or information value of the impugned item, which formed the basis for their decisions to produce and broadcast it.",argumentative,"['principle state paragraph', '<ORG> see number cause', 'number cause question appreciation', 'which form basis', 'decision produce decision', 'decision broadcast it']"
"Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the item was broadcast as part of a serious Danish news programme and was intended for a well-informed audience (see paragraph 9 above).",argumentative,"['it bear mind', 'item broadcast part']"
"The Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed.",argumentative,"['argument stress company', 'argument see paragraph', '<ORG> present attempt', 'attempt nterbalance view']"
"Both the TV presenter’s introduction and the applicant’s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of ""a group of extremist youths"" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them.",argumentative,"['tv presenters introduction dissociate he', 'tv presenters introduction dissociate person', 'tv presenters introduction dissociate example', 'applicants company duct dissociate he', 'applicants company duct dissociate person', 'applicants company duct dissociate example', 'who support <ORG>']"
The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs.,argumentative,"['applicant rebut some', 'applicant rebut instance', 'there be people', 'who have job']"
"It should finally not be forgotten that, taken as a whole, the filmed portrait surely conveyed the meaning that the racist statements were part of a generally anti-social attitude of the Greenjackets.",argumentative,[]
"Admittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race.",argumentative,"['number recall immorality danger', 'number recall unlawfulness']"
"However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used,",argumentative,"['limitation spell element', 'limitation spell item']"
the Court does not consider the absence of such precautionary reminders to be relevant.,argumentative,[]
"Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest.",argumentative,['bound set interest']
Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them.,argumentative,"['press have task', 'task impart information', 'task impart idea', 'public not have right', 'right receive they']"
"Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (ibid.).",argumentative,[]
The Court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance (ibid.).,argumentative,"['Court reiterate safeguard', 'company stitute one', 'safeguard afford to']"
We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area.,argumentative,"['company act margin', 'which leave area']"
"Accordingly, the findings of the Danish courts cannot be considered as giving rise to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.",argumentative,['finding not sidere rise']
"A journalist’s good intentions are not enough in such a situation, especially in a case in which he has himself provoked the racist statements.",argumentative,['he provoke statement']
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination probably does not require the punishment of journalists responsible for a television spot of this kind.,argumentative,['International Convention require punishment']
"On the other hand, it supports the opinion that the media too can be obliged to take a clear stand in the area of racial discrimination and hatred.",argumentative,"['it support opinion', 'medium oblige stand', 'medium oblige area', 'opinion take stand', 'opinion take area']"
"The threat of racial discrimination and persecution is certainly serious in our society, and the Court has rightly emphasised the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations (paragraph 30 of the judgment).",argumentative,"['<ORG> emphasise importance', 'company bate discrimination']"
"The Danish courts fully recognised that protection of persons whose human dignity is attacked has to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression. They carefully considered the responsibility of the applicant, and the reasons for their conclusions were relevant.",argumentative,"['protection have right', 'they sidere responsibility']"
"The protection of racial minorities cannot have less weight than the right to impart information, and in the concrete circumstances of the present case it is in our opinion not for this Court to substitute its own balancing of the conflicting interests for that of the Danish Supreme Court.",argumentative,"['protection not have weight', 'right impart information', 'Court substitute balancing']"
We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area.,argumentative,"['company act margin', 'which leave area']"
the applicant’s conviction being based on Articles 266 (b) and 23 (1) of the Penal Code.,argumentative,[]
"In this context, the Government pointed out that the former provision had been enacted in order to comply with the UN Convention.",argumentative,[]
"The Government’s argument, as the Court understands it, is that, whilst Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention is applicable, the Court, in applying paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), should consider that the relevant provisions of the Penal Code are to be interpreted and applied in an extensive manner, in accordance with the rationale of the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above).",argumentative,['court understand it']
"In other words, Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a way as to limit, derogate from or destroy the right to protection against racial discrimination under the UN Convention.",argumentative,"['number interpret way', 'way limit derogate', 'way destroy right']"
"It is moreover undisputed that this interference was ""prescribed by law""",argumentative,['interference prescribe law']

"It is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists.",non-argumentative,"['company substitute view', 'company substitute press', 'technique adopt journalist']"
"The Court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",non-argumentative,"['Court look interference', 'Court look light', 'reason adduce authority', 'reason justify it']"
"In doing so the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for instance, the Schwabe v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, pp. 32-33, para. 29).",non-argumentative,"['Court have itself', 'authority apply standard', 'principle embody article', 'they base themselves', 'they base assessment']"

"News reporting based on interviews, whether edited or not, constitutes one of the most important means whereby the press is able to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (see, for instance, the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",non-argumentative,"['news reporting base interview', 'news reporting stitute one', 'mean play role']"
The punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so.,non-argumentative,"['punishment assist dissemination', 'statement make person', 'statement make interview', 'punishment hamper company tribution', 'there be reason']"
In this regard the Court does not accept the Government’s argument that the limited nature of the fine is relevant; what matters is that the journalist was convicted.,non-argumentative,['Court accept governments argument']
"There can be no doubt that the remarks in respect of which the Greenjackets were convicted (see paragraph 14 above) were more than insulting to members of the targeted groups and did not enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) (see, for instance, the Commission’s admissibility decisions in Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands, applications nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, DR 18, p. 187; and Künen v.

"However, even having regard to the manner in which the applicant prepared the Greenjackets item (see paragraph 32 above), it has not been shown that, considered as a whole, the feature was such as to justify also his conviction of, and punishment for, a criminal offence under the Penal Code.",non-argumentative,"['applicant prepare <ORG>', 'it show company viction']"
"Having regard to the foregoing, the reasons adduced in support of the applicant’s conviction and sentence were not sufficient to establish convincingly that the interference thereby occasioned with the enjoyment of his right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society""; in particular the means employed were disproportionate to the aim of protecting ""the reputation or rights of others"".",non-argumentative,"['reason adduce support', 'interference occasion enjoyment', 'aim protect reputation']"

"In earlier decisions the Court has - in our view, rightly - underlined the great importance of the freedom of the press and the media in general for a democratic society, but it has never had to consider a situation in which ""the reputation or rights of others"" (Article 10 para. 2) (art. 10-2) were endangered to such an extent as here.",non-argumentative,"['Court underline importance', 'it never have situation']"

Therefore it is admittedly difficult to strike the right balance between the freedom of the press and the protection of others.,non-argumentative,[]
But the majority attributes much more weight to the freedom of the journalist than to the protection of those who have to suffer from racist hatred.,non-argumentative,"['majority attribute weight', 'majority attribute freedom', 'who have hatred', 'protection suffer hatred']"
Neither the written text of the interview (paragraph 11 of the judgment) nor the video film we have seen makes it clear that the remarks of the Greenjackets are intolerable in a society based on respect for human rights.,non-argumentative,['society base respect']

We cannot share the opinion of the majority of the Court in the Jersild case.,non-argumentative,['we not share opinion']
"There are indeed two major principles at issue in this case, one being that of freedom of expression, embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, the other the prohibition on defending racial hatred, which is obviously one of the restrictions authorised by paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and, moreover, is the subject of basic human rights documents adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, in particular the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.",non-argumentative,"['there be principle', 'freedom embody article', 'prohibition defend hatred', 'restriction authorise paragraph', 'right document adopt Convention']"

"In the Jersild case the statements made and willingly reproduced in the relevant broadcast on Danish television, without any significant reaction on the part of the commentator, did indeed amount to incitement to contempt not only of foreigners in general but more particularly of black people, described as belonging to an inferior, subhuman race (""the niggers ... are not human beings ...

"While appreciating that some judges attach particular importance to freedom of expression, the more so as their countries have largely been deprived of it in quite recent times, we cannot accept that this freedom should extend to encouraging racial hatred, contempt for races other than the one to which we belong, and defending violence against those who belong to the races in question.",non-argumentative,"['judge attach importance', 'judge attach freedom', 'company ntrie deprive time', 'freedom extend hatred', 'who belong race']"
It has been sought to defend the broadcast on the ground that it would provoke a healthy reaction of rejection among the viewers.,non-argumentative,"['it seek broadcast', 'it seek ground', 'it provoke reaction']"

"Large numbers of young people today, and even of the population at large, finding themselves overwhelmed by the difficulties of life, unemployment and poverty, are only too willing to seek scapegoats who are held up to them without any real word of caution; for - and this is an important point - the journalist responsible for the broadcast in question made no real attempt to challenge the points of view he was presenting, which was necessary if their impact was to be counterbalanced, at least for the viewers.",non-argumentative,"['population find life unemployment', 'themselves overwhelm difficulty', 'who hold word', 'journalist make attempt', 'attempt challenge point']"
"That being so, we consider that by taking criminal measures - which were, moreover, moderate ones - the Danish judicial institutions in no way infringed Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.",non-argumentative,['institution infringe article art']
We have voted against point 2 of the operative provisions of the judgment because we are so firmly convinced that the applicant was wrong not to react against the defence of racism that we consider it wholly unjustified to award him any compensation whatever.,non-argumentative,"['we vote point', 'number react defence']"
"As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).",non-argumentative,['<NAME> sulte Agent']
