"Mr Gül had left Turkey when his younger son Ersin was three months old, and had never attempted to develop a family life in his country of origin.",argumentative,['<NAME> leave Turkey']

In 1990 Mr and Mrs Gül were granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and then sought permission to bring their son Ersin to Switzerland.,argumentative,"['<NAME> grant residence permit', '<NAME> grant ground', 'permission bring son']"
Ersin has always lived in Turkey (see paragraph 19 above).,argumentative,[]

"In any event, whatever the applicant’s initial reasons for applying for political asylum, the visits he has made to his son in recent years tend to show that they are no longer valid.",argumentative,"['reason apply asylum', 'he make son', 'he make year']"
"His counsel, moreover, expressly confirmed this at the hearing.",argumentative,"['company firm this', 'company firm hearing']"
"In addition, according to the Government, by virtue of a social security convention concluded on 1 May 1969 between Switzerland and Turkey, the applicant could continue to receive his ordinary invalidity pension and half of the supplementary benefit he receives at present in respect of his wife, his son Ersin and his daughter Nursal if he returned to his home country (see paragraph 23 above).",argumentative,"['security company vention company clude security company vention company', 'he receive respect', 'he return home company']"
"Mrs Gül’s return to Turkey is more problematic, since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.",argumentative,"['that lead Swiss authority', 'that lead residence permit', 'that lead ground']"
"However, although her state of health seemed particularly alarming in 1987, when her accident occurred, it has not been proved that she could not later have received appropriate medical treatment in specialist hospitals in Turkey.",argumentative,"['state seem alarming', 'she receive treatment', 'she receive hospital']"
"She was, moreover, able to visit Turkey with her husband in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above).",argumentative,[]
"Furthermore, although Mr and Mrs Gül are lawfully resident in Switzerland, they do not have a permanent right of abode, as they do not have a settlement permit but merely a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, which could be withdrawn, and which under Swiss law does not give them a right to family reunion (see paragraph 18 above).",argumentative,"['they have right', 'they have settlement permit', 'which withdraw which', 'company withdraw which', 'which give they', 'which give right']"
"In view of the length of time Mr and Mrs Gül have lived in Switzerland, it would admittedly not be easy for them to return to Turkey, but there are, strictly speaking, no obstacles preventing them from developing family life in Turkey.",argumentative,"['number obstacle prevent they', 'number obstacle prevent family life', 'number obstacle develop family life']"

That possibility is all the more real because Ersin has always lived there and has therefore grown up in the cultural and linguistic environment of his country.,argumentative,[]
"On that point the situation is not the same as in the Berrehab case, where the daughter of a Moroccan applicant had been born in the Netherlands and spent all her life there (see the Berrehab judgment previously cited, p. 8, para. 7).",argumentative,"['daughter bear <NAME>', '<NAME> spend life']"
"Having regard to all these considerations,",argumentative,[]
"while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view,",argumentative,[]
"the Court finds that Switzerland has not failed to fulfil the obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and there has therefore been no interference in the applicant’s family life within the meaning of that Article (art. 8-1).",argumentative,"['Switzerland fail obligation', 'obligation arise article para']"
"True, as the Court recognised in the Berrehab judgment, subsequent events may break such a family life relationship, but only exceptional circumstances can warrant the conclusion that the tie between a parent and his or her child is severed.",argumentative,"['<ORG> recognise <NAME>', 'event break family life relationship', 'circumstance warrant company clusion']"
"The mere fact that, at the relevant date, the applicant had not seen his then seven-year-old son for almost seven years is not sufficient to produce this negative effect.",argumentative,"['applicant see son', 'applicant see year', 'number produce effect']"
"Accordingly, if on 19 September 1990 there existed ""family life"" between the applicant and his son Ersin, the applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) to the facts of the present case cannot be called into question.",argumentative,['there exist family life']
"""According to the Court’s well established case-law, ‘the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life’"", as the Court pointed out in paragraph 86 of the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55. Consequently, decisions of State authorities hindering such enjoyment in principle amount to an infringement of the State’s obligation to respect the family life of those concerned.",argumentative,"['enjoyment stitute element', '<ORG> point paragraph', 'decision hinder enjoyment', 'decision hinder principle', 'decision amount infringement', '<ORG> respect family life']"
It follows that the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland in principle entails their responsibility under Article 8 (art. 8).,argumentative,"['refusal grant applicant', 'refusal grant authorisation', 'authorisation reside principle', 'refusal entail responsibility']"
"Rightly so, for, generally speaking, it may be assumed that after a period of between three and five years immigrants become rooted in the country of settlement.",argumentative,[]
By then they have formed new social ties there and have definitively begun to adapt themselves to their new homeland.,argumentative,['they form tie']
"In assessing the humaneness of the choice with which the Swiss authorities confronted the applicant and his wife this element, the fact that they have become integrated in their new homeland - an element which, incidentally, is closely connected with their private life - is of far more importance than the formal status of their permit.",argumentative,"['authority company front applicant', 'authority company front wife', 'they integrate homeland', 'which necte life']"
"The first is that for the applicant and his wife the choice in question was not only between renouncing their son or renouncing the position which they had acquired in Switzerland, but also between renouncing their son Ersin or their little daughter Nursal who was being educated in a home in Switzerland and whose interests almost certainly would have required that she should be left behind.",argumentative,"['number renounce son', 'number renounce position', 'number renounce son', 'who educate home']"
"The second is that the applicant’s wife is dependent on medical care which she can certainly get in Switzerland, whilst it is in debate to what extent, if at all, she will be able to get it in Turkey.",argumentative,['care get it']
The third is that the mere fact that the Turkish authorities did not immediately arrest the applicant when he entered the country as a visitor does not imply that he would not get into trouble if he tried to settle there again on a permanent basis.,argumentative,"['authority arrest applicant', 'he enter <ORG>', 'he enter visitor', 'he get trouble', 'he try basis']"
"The fourth is that the applicant and his wife deserve compassion: whilst his wife had been suffering from epilepsy since 1982 and had a terrible accident in 1987, the applicant himself became disabled in 1990.",argumentative,"['applicant deserve company passion', 'wife deserve company passion', 'wife suffer epilepsy']"
Under these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey.,argumentative,"['it require applicant', 'it require wife', 'company ld number require applicant', 'company ld number require wife', 'they leave Switzerland']"
Under these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey.,argumentative,"['it require applicant', 'it require wife', 'company ld number require applicant', 'company ld number require wife', 'they leave Switzerland']"
"It follows that a proper balance was not achieved between the interests involved, that the refusal of the Swiss authorities is disproportionate and, as such, not necessary in a democratic society. I thus conclude that there was a violation of Article 8 (art. 8).",argumentative,['there be violation']
On 19 September 1990 there certainly was a family life relationship between the applicant and Ersin.,argumentative,[]
"Since Ersin was born from the legitimate marriage between the applicant and his wife,",argumentative,['<NAME> bear marriage']
"it follows from the aforementioned Berrehab judgment (p. 14, para. 21) that there is ipso facto such a relationship (see also the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 19, para. 54).",argumentative,"['it follow <NAME>', 'there be relationship']"
"Accordingly, if on 19 September 1990 there existed ""family life"" between the applicant and his son Ersin, the applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) to the facts of the present case cannot be called into question.",argumentative,['there exist family life']
"The present case concerns not only family life but also immigration, and the extent of a State’s obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest.",argumentative,"['case company cern number family life', 'case company cern number immigration', 'case company cern number extent', '<ORG> admit relative', '<ORG> admit territory', 'number vary circumstance']"
"As a matter of well-established international law and subject to its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory (see, among other authorities, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, para. 67).",argumentative,"['<ORG> have right', '<ORG> have <NAME>', '<ORG> have United Kingdom judgment', 'right trol entry']"
"Moreover, where immigration is concerned, Article 8 (art. 8) cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.",argumentative,"['obligation respect choice', 'obligation authorise family reunion']"
"In order to establish the scope of the State’s obligations, the facts of the case must be considered (see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 68, and the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 32, para. 88).",argumentative,['order establish scope']
"In this case, therefore, the Court’s task is to determine to what extent it is true that Ersin’s move to Switzerland would be the only way for Mr Gül to develop family life with his son.",argumentative,['<NAME> develop family life']
since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.,argumentative,"['that lead Swiss authority', 'that lead residence permit', 'that lead ground']"
Mrs Gül’s return to Turkey is more problematic,argumentative,[]
"The Court now holds that the applicable principles are similar, adding that in both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community",argumentative,[]
"For present purposes it may, therefore, be assumed that it makes no material difference whether a positive or a negative obligation is at stake.",argumentative,['it make difference']
The present doctrine notably implies that the distinction between the two types of obligation has no bearing on either the burden of proof or the standards for assessing whether a fair balance has been struck.,argumentative,"['doctrine number imply burden', 'distinction have number', 'distinction have burden']"
"It follows that the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland amounts to a violation of Article 8 (art. 8), unless it is deemed justified under paragraph 2 of that Article (art. 8-2) or under similar principles to those enshrined therein.",argumentative,"['refusal grant applicant', 'refusal grant authorisation', 'refusal amount violation', 'it deem justified', 'it deem paragraph']"

"It pointed out that under section 4 of the Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act (""the RSAA"" - see paragraph 20 below) the question whether to grant a residence permit (Aufenthaltsbewilligung) or settlement permit (Niederlassungsbewilligung) was determined by the competent cantonal authorities with unfettered discretion (nach freiem Ermessen), having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and international agreements.",non-argumentative,"['it point provision', 'question grant residence permit', 'question determine authority', 'question determine discretion']"
"In that connection, the authorities had to take account of the country’s moral and economic interests, and of the degree of immigrant penetration (Überfremdung).",non-argumentative,"['authority have account', 'authority have company']"
"The cantonal government then considered whether Mr Gül’s two sons could rely on a right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland (Anwesenheitsbewilligung) on the basis of the statutory provisions, as the agreement on settlement concluded by Turkey and Switzerland on 13 December 1990 did not confer such a right.",non-argumentative,"['son company ld rely right', 'son company ld rely basis', 'right obtain permission', 'agreement clude agreement']"
Under section 17 (2) of the RSAA (see paragraph 20 below) a minor did not have such a right unless his parent was in possession of a settlement permit.,non-argumentative,"['minor have right', 'number have right']"
"As Mr and Mrs Gül only had a residence permit, they could not rely on that provision in order to assert a right to family reunion.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> have residence permit', 'company ld number rely provision']"
"As for the guarantees set forth in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, only Swiss nationals or persons in possession of a settlement permit could rely on these; Mr and Mrs Gül fell into neither of those categories.",non-argumentative,"['guarantee set article', 'national fall category']"
Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) did not confer a right but merely set out the minimum conditions to be satisfied before family reunion could be authorised.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> fer right']
"The cantonal authorities had the final say on the matter, and in reaching their decision they had unfettered discretion.",non-argumentative,"['authority have say', 'they have discretion']"
"It being established that the provisions concerned could only apply, if at all, to the minor son, Ersin, the cantonal government listed the minimum conditions which Article 39 para. 1 of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) required to be satisfied by a foreigner living in Switzerland before family reunion could be authorised, namely:",non-argumentative,"['government list company dition', 'paragraph require foreigner', 'paragraph satisfy foreigner']"

"The calculations made by the Aliens Police and the cantonal government’s legal service, which investigated the case, show that Mr Gül has not satisfied the condition laid down in Article 39 para. 1 (c) of the OLNA.",non-argumentative,"['calculation make calculation', 'which investigate case', '<NAME> satisfy company dition', 'company dition lay article para']"
He does not have sufficient means to support his family during their residence in Switzerland.,non-argumentative,"['he have mean', 'mean support family', 'mean support residence']"
"According to the reference calculation, Mr Gül should have a monthly net income of at least 2,710 Swiss francs (CHF) if he is not to fall below the minimum standard of living.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> have income', 'number fall standard']"
"That figure is derived from the base rates used by the cantonal social security office for assessing the likelihood of reliance on social security, which are on the whole identical with the base rates adopted by the Swiss Conference on Public Assistance for the calculation of financial support.",non-argumentative,"['figure derive base rate', 'base rate use <ORG>', 'base rate use likelihood', 'base rate assess likelihood', 'base rate adopt calculation']"
"These base rates are used to establish the monthly living expenses of the foreigner concerned and the members of his family seeking to join him, which have to be covered by his income.",non-argumentative,"['rate use living expense', 'rate use member', 'member seek he', 'member join he', 'which have income', 'living expense ere income']"
This must be sufficient to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also a minimum standard of living.,non-argumentative,[]
In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account.,non-argumentative,"['interest prevent family', 'interest prevent burden', 'interest become burden', 'interest take account']"
"Mr Gül’s net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which falls CHF 650 short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services.",non-argumentative,"['amount require standard', 'standard calculate social security service']"
"The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home has not been taken into account, as it is not known who pays for this.",non-argumentative,"['company keep child', 'company keep in', 'company take account', 'number take account']"
"The calculation of income is based on pay-slips from 1989, the latest available.",non-argumentative,['calculation base pay slip']
On 23 October 1990 the Liestal Cantonal Hospital sent the Basle Rural Aliens Police a medical certificate stating that Mr Gül was 100% unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine.,non-argumentative,"['<ORG> send <ORG>', '<ORG> send certificate', 'certificate state certificate', 'certificate remain period']"
"On enquiry being made, it was confirmed in a medical certificate dated 19 April 1991 that Mr Gül had suffered from 100% incapacity since April 1990 and would remain unfit for work for the foreseeable future.",non-argumentative,"['it firm certificate', '<NAME> suffer incapacity']"
The Pratteln municipal social security services stated in a letter of 11 June 1991 that Mr Gül would have to have several operations and that for the time being he was waiting to be awarded an invalidity pension.,non-argumentative,"['security service state letter', '<NAME> have operation', 'he wait invalidity pension']"
"For the first three months of this year alone the social security services have paid the Gül family CHF 8,731.75, and the family will remain dependent on social security payments.",non-argumentative,"['social security service pay <NAME>', 'social security service pay CHF']"
In June 1991 Mr Gül stated during a personal interview with the subordinate authority (Vorinstanz) that his family was at that time entirely dependent on social security payments.,non-argumentative,['<NAME> state interview']
He therefore has no other source of income.,non-argumentative,['he have source']
"At present the social security services are paying the Gül family the amount needed by a three-person family, but no more.",non-argumentative,"['security service pay <NAME>', 'security service pay amount', 'amount need person family']"
The social security services cannot be expected to provide for children arriving from abroad when it is known in advance that they will have to support them.,non-argumentative,"['security service not expect child', 'it know advance', 'they have they']"
Nor can Mr Gül support his other children from his own resources. For that reason alone the application for family reunion must be refused.,non-argumentative,"['<NAME> support child', '<NAME> support resource']"
Article 39 para. 1 (d) also requires firm arrangements to be made for the care of children.,non-argumentative,[]
"But Mrs Gül, for reasons connected with her illness, is not mentally or physically capable of keeping her daughter Nursal with her and looking after her.",non-argumentative,[]
"That is why Nursal has been brought up in the ""Auf Berg"" children’s home in Seltisberg, where she is to remain.",non-argumentative,['<NAME> bring <NAME>']
"It follows that if Mr and Mrs Gül’s eight-year-old son Ersin joined the family, it is not at all certain that firm arrangements could be made for his care.",non-argumentative,"['son join family', 'arrangement company make care']"
"He too would presumably have to be brought up in a children’s home, which is not the aim of family reunion.",non-argumentative,['he have children home']
A medical certificate dated 18 April 1991 states that Mrs Gül is suffering from a serious illness which makes it necessary for her to have constant medical supervision and treatment.,non-argumentative,"['certificate state supervision', '<NAME> suffer illness', 'which make supervision', 'she have supervision', 'she have treatment']"
The cantonal government went on to say that residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds under Article 13 (f) of the OLNA could not in addition confer on the recipients a right to family reunion.,non-argumentative,['residence permit issue ground']
"In order to ensure equal treatment for all aliens not having the right to reside in Switzerland, such reunion could take place only under Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA.",non-argumentative,"['order ensure treatment', 'alien have right', '<ORG> take place', '<ORG> take article']"
"Lastly, the cantonal government considered the situation of the younger boy from the standpoint of Article 36 of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below), announcing its decision in the following terms:",non-argumentative,"['government company sidere situation', 'government company sidere standpoint']"
Ersin Gül is only eight.,non-argumentative,[]
"It must be determined whether his entry into Switzerland would be in accordance with Article 36 of the OLNA, which requires an `important reason’ that is lacking in this case.",non-argumentative,"['which require reason', 'that lack case']"
There is no special reason for treating Ersin Gül differently from other children wishing to rejoin their families in respect of whom the conditions laid down in Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA have not been satisfied.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'reason treat <NAME>', 'child wish family', 'child rejoin family']"
Another reason for refusing to admit him to Switzerland is the fact that Ersin and Tuncay Gül would be separated.,non-argumentative,"['reason refuse he', 'reason admit he']"
Ersin has lived with Tuncay since birth.,non-argumentative,[]
"On the other hand, he has been separated from his father and mother for eight years and three and a half years respectively.",non-argumentative,"['he separate father', 'he separate year', 'he separate mother', 'he separate year']"
"Having regard to the child’s welfare, which plays an important role in family reunion cases, the question arises, at the very least, whether it is reasonable to separate him from his brother and the environment he is used to in order to bring him to live with his mother, who is seriously ill and unable to keep him with her or look after him, and his father, who went away to Switzerland three month’s after Ersin’s birth, which means that he hardly knows him.",non-argumentative,"['which play role', 'question arise brother', 'question arise mother', 'question arise mother', 'order bring he', 'order bring mother', 'order live mother', 'mother keep he', 'who go <NAME>', 'he know he']"
"In view of all the circumstances, and having regard to the child’s welfare, the cantonal government considers that Ersin Gül should not be authorised to join his parents in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,['<NAME> authorise parent']
"In any case, there is no important reason within the meaning of Article 36 of the OLNA which requires him to be admitted to Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'which require he']"
The cantonal government concluded that Mr Gül had not satisfied the conditions laid down for family reunion and that his children could not rely on Article 13 (f) or Article 36 of the OLNA either in order to come to Switzerland to join him.,non-argumentative,"['government company clude child company ld number', '<NAME> have child company ld number', 'number satisfy company dition', 'company dition lay family reunion', 'child company ld number rely order', 'company join he']"
On 2 September 1991 the applicant lodged an administrative-law appeal with the Swiss Federal Court.,non-argumentative,['applicant lodge law appeal']
"He repeated his previous arguments (see paragraph 15 above) and added that, because of the ""special circumstances"", Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention gave his sons the right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['he repeat argument', 'right obtain permission']"
"The earlier issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds to himself, his wife and his daughter had been based on the finding that a return to Turkey was impossible, as it would put the health of his wife and daughter seriously at risk.",non-argumentative,"['issue base finding', 'it put health', 'it put risk']"
"Mr Gül argued that the same considerations which had prevailed in the decision to grant that residence permit should prevent any withdrawal thereof, which would be tantamount to subjecting Mrs Gül, whose state of health was still causing concern, to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",non-argumentative,"['which prevail decision', 'decision grant residence permit', 'company sideration prevent withdrawal', 'withdrawal subject <NAME>', 'state cause <ORG>', 'state cause treatment']"
"The residence permit issued to Mr and Mrs Gül on humanitarian grounds was therefore the equivalent of a settlement permit, and it followed that they had the right to family reunion, which could only take place in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['residence permit issue to', 'residence permit issue ground', 'they have right', 'which take place', 'company take place']"
In a judgment of 2 July 1993 the Federal Court declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible.,non-argumentative,[]
"It pointed out that, pursuant to section 100 (b) (3) of the Federal Administration of Justice Act, an administrative-law appeal in an immigration-control case was inadmissible if it concerned the issue or refusal of permits to which federal legislation conferred no entitlement.",non-argumentative,"['it point issue', 'company cerne issue', 'legislation company ferre number entitlement']"
"Like the cantonal government, the Federal Court found that neither section 17 (2) of the RSAA nor Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention conferred such a right on an alien resident outside Switzerland whose parent living in Switzerland had only a residence permit, as Mr Gül did.",non-argumentative,['parent have residence permit']
"In particular, Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention could be relied on only by a person who had the right of abode in Switzerland either by virtue of his Swiss nationality or by virtue of a settlement permit.",non-argumentative,"['who have right', 'who have virtue']"
The court gave this ruling in the following terms:,non-argumentative,"['company give ruling', 'company give term']"
Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for family life.,non-argumentative,['right respect family life']
"In certain circumstances the right to be issued with a residence permit can be deduced from this (see ATF [Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 118 Ib 152 at 4, 157 at c; 116 Ib 355 at 1b; 109 Ib 185 at 2), so that Article 8 (art. 8) may be breached where an alien whose family lives in Switzerland is refused leave to enter the country.",non-argumentative,"['right issue residence permit', 'alien refuse leave', 'leave enter <ORG>']"
"According to the Federal Court’s established case-law, however, a breach can occur only where the family members living in Switzerland themselves possess a well-established right of abode (Anwesenheitsrecht).",non-argumentative,['family member possess right']
"For that purpose, it is in principle necessary to have Swiss nationality or possess a settlement permit (see ATF 116 Ib 355 at 1b; 115 Ib 4 at 1d).",non-argumentative,[]
"A mere residence permit is at any rate not sufficient unless it is based on a firmly established right (see ATF 111 Ib 163/4 at 1a), as the Federal Court has held in many unpublished judgments (most recently in the judgment of 6 April 1993 in the case of K., at 1b) ...",non-argumentative,"['it base right', 'right see <ORG>', '<ORG> hold judgment', '<ORG> hold judgment']"
"That is, moreover, consistent with the new provisions on the legal status of aliens having family members in Switzerland (sections 7 and 17 (2) of the RSAA, as amended on 23 March 1990, which came into force on 1 January 1992).",non-argumentative,"['alien have family member', 'which come force']"
"Under the Act the right to family reunion presupposes a firmly established right of abode, as pointed out above (at 1b).",non-argumentative,['right presuppose right']
"Given that the legislature’s intention in adopting the amendment in question was precisely to take account of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights (see Bbl [Federal Gazette] 1987 III, pp. 293 et seq., particularly pp. 321 and 322), there is no reason, when that provision (art. 8) of the Convention is invoked with regard to recognition of legal rights in the matter of residence permits, to go beyond what the Act itself expressly provides (see the Federal Court’s unpublished judgment of 6 April 1993 in the case of K., at 1b).",non-argumentative,"['legislatures intention adopt amendment', 'there be number reason']"
"The Federal Court also emphasised the differences between settlement permits and residence permits, stating:",non-argumentative,['<ORG> emphasise difference']
"Unlike settlement permits, which are issued for an indefinite period (section 6 (1) of the Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act - hereinafter the RSAA), residence permits are always subject to a time-limit (section 5 (1) of the RSAA).",non-argumentative,['which issue period section']
"Whatever the reason for granting the first residence permit, an alien must therefore allow for the possibility that his permit will not be renewed.",non-argumentative,"['reason grant residence permit', 'alien allow possibility']"
"There could be many reasons for this, including, for example, police, economic or demographic considerations.",non-argumentative,[]
"Although the alien’s personal circumstances have to be taken into account in the inquiry into the proportionality of the decision not to renew, that does not mean that the alien is on that account entitled to have his residence permit renewed.",non-argumentative,"['circumstance have account', 'circumstance have inquiry']"
The above statement of the law also applies to residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds.,non-argumentative,"['statement apply residence permit', 'residence permit issue ground']"
"In addition, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the particular circumstances which justified the issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds will subsequently cease to exist, or lose their significance to such an extent that not only will there no longer be any reason to exclude the person concerned from the quotas, but even renewal of the residence permit will no longer be justified.",non-argumentative,"['which justify issue', 'which justify ground', 'circumstance cease possibility', 'possibility lose significance', 'possibility lose extent', 'reason exclude cerne', 'reason exclude quota']"
"Moreover, it is apparent from the rule established in Article 12 para. 2 of the OLNA that the conditions required for a finding that the case is an extremely serious one may subsequently cease to exist (see the unpublished judgment of 3 July 1992 in the case of P., at 6).",non-argumentative,"['rule establish article para', 'dition cease judgment']"
The question whether the case is of this type is therefore entirely separate from the question whether the person concerned has the right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland by virtue of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights (see ATF 115 Ib 8).,non-argumentative,"['right obtain permission', 'right obtain virtue']"
"Furthermore, in the instant case the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out that in the future the medical or other reasons which led the authorities to grant the residence permit will lose their significance, or that new grounds justifying a refusal to renew the permit will become apparent.",non-argumentative,"['possibility not rule ground', 'which lead authority', 'which lead residence permit', 'reason grant residence permit', 'reason lose significance', 'ground justify refusal', 'refusal renew permit']"
The appellant can therefore not deduce from the fact that he is authorised to reside in Switzerland any right to the issue of a residence permit for his sons.,non-argumentative,"['appellant deduce right', 'appellant deduce fact']"
"The Federal Court went on to say that the question how the OLNA should be applied to the issue of permits was not one it had to examine in connection with the administrative-law appeal, as the cantonal government had already looked into the question whether the Güls’ younger son could be issued with a residence permit under Article 36 of the OLNA.",non-argumentative,"['OLNA apply issue', 'it have company nection', 'it have law appeal', 'number examine company nection', 'number examine law appeal', 'government look question', 'son company issue residence permit']"

Owing to his grandfather’s limited financial resources and the distance between the homes of some of these families and the school it was not possible for the boy to attend school on a regular basis.,non-argumentative,"['boy attend school', 'boy attend basis']"
"As is evidenced by an article which appeared in the Turkish newspaper Sabah on 25 July 1995, Mr and Mrs Gül visited their son in Turkey in July and August 1995.",non-argumentative,"['which appear newspaper', '<NAME> visit son']"

"Like the applicant, the Commission considered that the bond between Mr Gül and his son Ersin amounted to ""family life"".",non-argumentative,['bond amount family life']
"The Court reiterates that it follows from the concept of family on which Article 8 (art. 8) is based that a child born of a marital union is ipso jure part of that relationship; hence, from the moment of the child’s birth and by the very fact of it, there exists between him and his parents a bond amounting to ""family life"" (see the Berrehab v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 June 1988, series A no. 138, p. 14, para. 21, and the Hokkanen v.

"Secondly, it is necessary to ascertain whether there was interference by the Swiss authorities with the applicant’s right under Article 8 (art. 8).",non-argumentative,['there be interference']
"Mr Gül submitted that the result in practice of the authorities’ persistent refusal to allow Ersin to join him in Switzerland had been to separate the family and make it impossible, owing to lack of sufficient financial resources, for the parents to maintain regular contacts with their son, whereas, according to the Court’s case-law, contacts between parents and child were of capital importance.",non-argumentative,"['<NAME> join he', 'parent maintain company tact', 'parent maintain son']"
"In addition, the length of time Mr Gül had lived in Switzerland, his invalidity and his wife’s ill-health made family reunion in Turkey an unrealistic prospect, so that the family could only be brought together again in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,[]

"In addition, Switzerland had fully discharged the positive obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), as the invalidity pension the applicant was in receipt of enabled him to make occasional visits to Turkey.",non-argumentative,"['Switzerland discharge obligation', 'obligation arise article para', 'invalidity pension enable he', 'invalidity pension enable visit']"
"Lastly, the Swiss authorities were not under any obligation to ensure that the applicant led an optimal family life in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,['applicant lead family life']
"The Commission considered that where a parent wanted his minor child to live with him, preventing this amounted to interference with his right to respect for family life, and that the family would need to be reunited in Switzerland rather than in Turkey in view of Mr and Mrs Gül’s particular circumstances.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> sidere family', 'prevent amount interference', 'family need view']"

What is at stake in this case is whether the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland with his parents violated Switzerland’s obligation under Article 8 (art. 8) to respect the applicant’s family life.,non-argumentative,"['refusal grant applicant', 'refusal grant authorisation', 'authorisation reside parent', 'refusal violate Switzerlands obligation']"
"Consequently, the circumstances obtaining at the date of the (first) refusal of the requested authorisation - that is 19 September 1990 - are decisive.",non-argumentative,['circumstance obtain date']
"I will come back to these circumstances hereinafter (see paragraph 14), but I note already here that on 19 September 1990 the applicant and his wife were living lawfully in Switzerland having been granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds on 15 February 1990.",non-argumentative,['I company I']
"Their son Ersin, who was born on 20 January 1983, was then 7 years old and lived in Turkey under circumstances which still remain controversial (see paragraph 12 below).",non-argumentative,[]
One more preliminary remark with regard to the facts.,non-argumentative,[]
"The Court has repeatedly stressed that it is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it (see, inter alia, the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 29, para. 74).",non-argumentative,"['it bind <ORG>', 'it see Sweden judgment']"
"In doing so we should, however, bear in mind our limitations and be particularly careful not to take into account facts other than those which are properly established.",non-argumentative,"['we bear limitation', 'we bear mind', 'number take fact', 'number take account']"
"The Government have contended - without basing their contention on specific facts - that in 1983 the applicant left Turkey ""of his own free will, preferring to seek employment in Switzerland"" thereby suggesting that the applicant’s assertion that he came to Switzerland as a refugee was a falsehood.",non-argumentative,"['government tend company tention', 'applicant leave Turkey', 'applicant leave will', 'fact prefer employment', 'fact seek employment', 'he come refugee']"
"However, although the applicant sought asylum on 26 April 1983, his application was only dismissed on 9 February 1989 together with that of his wife (which dated from 8 February 1988).",non-argumentative,"['applicant seek asylum', 'application dismiss wife']"
The applicant appealed.,non-argumentative,[]
"This appeal was never decided because the applicant withdrew his application, since - as his counsel put it without being contradicted - pursuing the application for asylum was incompatible with accepting the residence permit on humanitarian grounds that had been offered to him and his wife.",non-argumentative,"['appeal never decide ground', 'applicant withdraw application', '<ORG> put it', 'that offer to']"
"Under these circumstances it is not for us to simply base ourselves on the refusal at first instance or to speculate, thirteen years hence, on the truth and relevance of the assertions underlying the applicant’s asylum request.",non-argumentative,"['we base ourselves', 'we base refusal', 'assertion underlie applicants asylum request']"
"True, it is common ground that in the summer of 1995 the applicant visited Ersin in Turkey and, although attracting notice by a press interview, has apparently not experienced any disagreeableness from the Turkish authorities.",non-argumentative,['that visit <ORG>']
"However, that does not in itself warrant the conclusion that thirteen years earlier, in 1983, the applicant had no relevant and sufficient grounds for fleeing from persecution in Turkey and requesting asylum in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['that warrant company clusion', 'number warrant company clusion', 'ground flee persecution', 'ground request asylum']"
"In its Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, the Court adopted the established doctrine of the Commission that although, certainly, the right of aliens to enter or to remain in a country is not as such guaranteed by the Convention, immigration controls have to be exercised consistently with Convention obligations and that, accordingly, the exclusion of a person from a State where members of his family are living may raise an issue under Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 59 and 60 of the judgment).",non-argumentative,"['Court adopt doctrine', 'right enter right', 'right remain company', 'number guarantee Convention immigration company trol', 'doctrine have Convention obligation', 'doctrine exercise Convention obligation', 'exclusion raise issue', 'exclusion raise article art']"
"Since this judgment there has been a considerable evolution in the Court’s general doctrine on Article 8 (art. 8), but not on this point.",non-argumentative,[]
"On the contrary, its subsequent case-law has solidly confirmed the principle that, although Contracting States have, as a matter of well-established international law, the right to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens, that right is subject to their obligations under the Convention, notably those under Article 8 (art. 8) (see the Berrehab v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 138, pp. 15-16, paras. 28-29; the Moustaquim v.

To the evolution in the Court’s general doctrine on Article 8 (art. 8) I will return in paragraph 7 below.,non-argumentative,['I return paragraph']
In this context it is immaterial whether the applicant left his wife and Ersin under fear from political prosecution or purely for economic reasons.,non-argumentative,"['applicant leave wife', 'applicant leave fear']"
"Before it is possible to assess whether the refusal was justified, it is - alas - necessary to give some consideration to the question whether or not Switzerland’s obligation under Article 8 (art. 8) is a positive or a negative one.",non-argumentative,[]
The Court’s case-law distinguishes between positive and negative obligations.,non-argumentative,['<ORG> distinguish obligation']
"Negative obligations require member States to refrain from action, positive to take action.",non-argumentative,"['obligation require member States', 'obligation require action']"
"The Court has repeatedly stressed that the boundaries between the two types ""do not lend themselves to precise definition"" (see, for instance, the Keegan v. Ireland judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, para. 49).",non-argumentative,"['boundary lend themselves', 'boundary lend definition']"
"The present case well illustrates the truth of this proposition since the question whether the Swiss decision violated a positive or a negative obligation, if either, seems hardly more than one of semantics: the refusal of the Swiss authorities to let Ersin and his parents be reunited may be considered as an action from which they should have refrained, whereas it could arguably also be viewed as failing to take an action which they were required to take, namely making a reunion possible by granting the authorisation.",non-argumentative,"['case illustrate truth', 'decision violate positive', 'refusal sidere action', 'action make authorisation', 'action grant authorisation']"
"If one takes the view that, if there is a violation at all, it must be of a positive obligation - a view that finds support in the aforementioned Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment (see paragraph 4 above) - then one has to put up with the rather awkward systematic inconsistency that exclusion of a person from a state where his family lives does not fall into the same category of breaches as expulsion of a person from a state where his family lives: the former decision may be in breach of a positive obligation under Article 8 (art. 8), whereas the latter may be in breach of a negative obligation.",non-argumentative,"['one take view', 'there be violation', 'that find support', 'that find judgment', 'view see paragraph', 'one have inconsistency', 'inconsistency fall category']"
These and other difficulties in distinguishing between cases where positive and cases where negative obligations are at stake would be immaterial if both kinds of obligation were treated alike.,non-argumentative,"['difficulty distinguish case', 'difficulty distinguish case']"
"There was a time, however, when the Court’s case-law did treat them differently.",non-argumentative,"['there be time', '<ORG> treat they']"
"The Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment is a striking instance: see paragraph 67 of that judgment.",non-argumentative,[]
"Under the pretext of the vagueness of the notion ""respect"" in Article 8 (art. 8) the Court held that its requirements will vary from case to case, thus creating for itself the possibility of taking into account, when establishing whether or not there is a positive obligation, whether or not there is a consensus between member States and, moreover, a wide margin of appreciation for the State concerned.",non-argumentative,"['Court hold possibility', 'requirement vary case', 'possibility take account', 'there be obligation', 'there be company sensus']"
This approach has been rightly criticised both outside and inside the Court.,non-argumentative,[]
"One of the main objections was that under this doctrine, in the context of positive obligations, the margin of appreciation might already come into play at the stage of determining the existence of the obligation, whilst in the context of negative obligations it only plays a role, if at all, at the stage of determining whether a breach of the obligation is justified.",non-argumentative,"['margin company play', 'margin company stage', 'stage determine existence', 'stage determine company text', 'it play role', 'it play stage']"
"The Court’s doctrine on this point has, however, evolved considerably since the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment.",non-argumentative,[]
The aforementioned difference in treatment between positive and negative obligations has gradually dwindled away.,non-argumentative,[]
"I agree with the Commission that the requirements of ""in accordance with the law"" and ""legitimate aim"" are fulfilled.",non-argumentative,[]
"The applicant’s argument that the refusal was not ""in accordance with the law"" did not convince me.",non-argumentative,[]
"On the other hand I cannot help saying that I consider the Government’s attempt to embellish the harsh, political objectives of their decision by pleading that in the first place it was designed to serve Ersin’s interests rather hypocritical.",non-argumentative,"['government attempt embellish objective', 'it design <ORG>', 'government attempt serve <ORG>']"
"The stress laid on financial considerations makes it clear that the legitimate aim pursued was, if not only then mainly, ""the interests of the economic well-being of the country"".",non-argumentative,['stress lay company sideration']
It follows that in any event the decisive question is whether the refusal of authorisation to reside in Switzerland was proportionate.,non-argumentative,[]
"Was it ""necessary in a democratic society"" to refuse the applicant’s seven-year-old son Ersin authorisation to come and live in Switzerland with his parents? In other words, did that decision of the Swiss authorities strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the applicant, his wife and their son on the one hand and those of the community as a whole on the other?",non-argumentative,"['authorisation company authorisation', 'authorisation live parent', 'decision strike balance']"
In explaining the interests of the community the Government have stressed that Switzerland has a very high percentage of foreigners living within its borders.,non-argumentative,"['Switzerland have percentage', 'foreigner live border']"
"Hence, as counsel for the Government put it at our hearing, ""in Switzerland immigration is a particularly sensitive subject"".",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> put it', '<ORG> put hearing']"
"Against this background the Government are, understandably, afraid of creating a precedent and therefore emphasise - rightly - that what is at stake is their right to control the entry of non-nationals into their territory and that, accordingly, we should leave them a wide margin of appreciation.",non-argumentative,"['right trol entry', 'we leave they', 'we leave margin']"
"In this context they stress that they have only granted the applicant and his wife a temporary residence permit on humanitarian grounds, that as a consequence of that generosity they have already to bear the costs of subsistence of the applicant, his wife and their daughter Nursal and that it is therefore asking too much to expect them to do the same for Ersin.",non-argumentative,"['they stress wife', 'they stress it', 'they grant applicant', 'they grant residence permit', 'they grant ground', 'they grant wife', 'they have company t', 'it ask much', 'they do same']"
So much for the one scale of the balance.,non-argumentative,[]
What lies in the other?,non-argumentative,[]
"First and foremost, of course, a fundamental element of an elementary human right, the right to care for your own children.",non-argumentative,['right care child']
"It was only natural that the applicant and his wife, as soon as their residence situation was regularised, wanted their seven-year-old son to live with them.",non-argumentative,[]
"There is a dispute as to Ersin’s living conditions, but I need not go deeply into that.",non-argumentative,['there be dispute']
"It suffices to note that the Government have not convincingly established that those conditions were satisfactory, let alone that, at the decisive moment, it was more in the interest of Ersin to remain in Turkey than to be reunited with his father and mother.",non-argumentative,"['it suffice father', '<ORG> establish father']"
The Government do not argue that these are not weighty interests.,non-argumentative,[]
"But they seek to diminish their relevance by contending that the applicant - on whom, they add, is the burden - has not shown that there are obstacles to re-establishing the family - father, mother and Ersin - in Turkey.",non-argumentative,"['they seek relevance', 'they seek company', 'applicant show family mother', 'there be obstacle', 'obstacle establish family mother']"
"It is clear that the Government are thus relying on paragraph 68 of the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment.",non-argumentative,['government rely paragraph']
"However, they choose to ignore the fact that the Court, in the first sentence of that paragraph, explicitly distinguishes ""the present proceedings"" - i.e. the cases of the three wives that were before the Court - from the case of ""immigrants who already had a family which they left behind in another country until they had achieved settled status in the United Kingdom"" (= the country of settlement).",non-argumentative,"['they choose fact', '<ORG> distinguish proceeding', '<ORG> distinguish case', 'who have family', 'they leave company ntry', 'they achieve status']"
"That is an important proviso, for it strongly suggests that in a case of ""immigrants who already had a family which they left behind"" - such as the present applicant - different norms should be applied.",non-argumentative,['who have family']
Which norms?,non-argumentative,[]
"The Court does not answer that question, but it is natural to infer that it intended to make it clear that in respect of such cases it might possibly hold that, in the context of the issue of family reunion, the State of settlement should respect the choice of the immigrants who have achieved settled status there and, accordingly, must accept members of their family which they had left behind for settlement.",non-argumentative,"['Court answer question', 'state respect choice', 'who achieve status', 'they leave settlement']"
"In other words, contrary to the Government’s suggestion, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment is no authority for their allegation that Switzerland may refuse Ersin entry - although he is a member of the family which the applicant and his wife left behind - on the mere ground that if the applicant and his wife want family reunion they should go back to Turkey, there being a violation of Switzerland’s obligations under Article 8 (art. 8) only if the applicant proves that there are obstacles to doing so or other special reasons why that could not be expected of him.",non-argumentative,"['Switzerland refuse <NAME>', 'applicant leave ground', 'wife leave ground', 'applicant want family reunion', 'wife want family reunion', 'applicant prove obstacle', 'there be obstacle']"
"On the contrary, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment supports the proposition that in cases where a father and mother have achieved settled status in a country and want to be reunited with their child which for the time being they have left behind in their country of origin, it is per se unreasonable, if not inhumane to give them the choice between giving up the position which they have acquired in the country of settlement or to renounce the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company which constitutes a fundamental element of family life.",non-argumentative,"['judgment support proposition', 'father achieve status', 'father achieve company ntry', 'mother achieve status', 'mother achieve company ntry', 'case want child', 'case reunite child', 'they leave origin', 'proposition give they', 'proposition give choice', 'choice give position', 'choice give settlement', 'choice renounce enjoyment', 'company stitute element']"
"It remains, of course, to be considered whether the latter principle applies in the present case, where the applicant has not ""achieved settled status"" in Switzerland, in so far as he and his wife have not been granted a ""settlement permit"", but have to base their right of residence on a permit which has, in principle, a temporary character and, consequently, a lower legal status than a settlement permit.",non-argumentative,"['it remain case', 'principle apply case', 'applicant achieve status', 'he grant settlement permit', 'wife grant settlement permit', 'case have right', 'case have permit', 'case base right', 'case base permit', 'which have character', 'which have principle', 'which have status']"
"It cannot be denied that, from a point of view of State interest - that is from a point of view of immigration and residence - there is a good case for answering this question in the negative.",non-argumentative,"['there be case', 'case answer question', 'case answer negative']"
"However, the European Court of Human Rights has to ensure, in particular, that State interests do not crush those of an individual, especially in situations where political pressure - such as the growing dislike of immigrants in most member States - may inspire State authorities to harsh decisions.",non-argumentative,"['<ORG> crush those', '<ORG> crush situation', 'pressure inspire <ORG>', 'pressure inspire decision']"
"As we stressed in paragraph 29 of our aforementioned Berrehab judgment (see paragraph 4 above), the Court must examine cases like this not only from the point of view of immigration and residence, but also with regard to the mutual interests of the applicant, his wife and Ersin.",non-argumentative,"['we stress paragraph', 'Court examine case', 'Court examine point']"
"Whether he came as a refugee (as we must presume (see paragraph 3 above)) or as a job seeker (as the Government allege), at the material time the applicant had been living in Switzerland for seven years and his wife for four years.",non-argumentative,"['he come refugee', 'government allege time', 'applicant live year']"
"During these years he had been legally employed, apparently by the same employer, until an unspecified date in 1990 when he fell ill (see paragraph 7 of the Court’s judgment).",non-argumentative,"['he employ employer', 'he employ date']"
"The Swiss authorities have taken this time element into consideration, since their decision to grant a residence permit was partly based on the time the applicant had been living in Switzerland (see paragraph 11 of the Court’s judgment).",non-argumentative,"['authority take time element', 'authority take company sideration', 'decision grant residence permit', 'decision base time']"
"There are some further, specific elements to be taken into account.",non-argumentative,"['there be element', 'element take account']"

The only effect of a finding that a case is an extremely serious one within the meaning of Article 13 (f) of the Federal Council’s Order Limiting the Number of Aliens of 6 October 1986 (hereinafter the OLNA - SR 823.21) is to exclude the alien concerned from the quotas laid down in that Order; it does not imply the existence of a right to a residence permit.,non-argumentative,"['meaning limit number', 'it imply existence']"
