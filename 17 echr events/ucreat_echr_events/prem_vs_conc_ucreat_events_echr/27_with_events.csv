There had in their contention not been any danger for them or their families.,premise,[]
"Moreover, the interrogation of the witnesses should in their contention not have taken place before the investigating judge.",premise,"['interrogation take place', 'interrogation take judge']"
"It would in their view have been feasible to have the police officers questioned in open court, wearing disguise if need be.",premise,[]
"In addition, the applicants considered that they had not had sufficient opportunity to challenge and question the police officers.",premise,"['applicants sidere opportunity', 'they have number', 'opportunity challenge opportunity', 'opportunity question police officer']"
They drew attention to the conditions under which the interrogation of the anonymous witnesses had taken place.,premise,"['they draw attention', 'they draw company dition', 'interrogation take place']"
"The anonymous police officers had been confined in a room with the investigating judge, separated from the applicants and their lawyers; it had not been possible for the applicants or their lawyers to discover whether there had been any other person in that room or what was going on there.",premise,"['police officer fine room', 'judge separate applicant', 'judge separate lawyer', 'applicant discover what']"
Not all the questions asked by the defence had been answered.,premise,['question ask defence']
"Finally, the applicants claimed that their conviction had been based ""to a decisive extent"" on the evidence given by anonymous witnesses.",premise,"['company viction base extent', 'company viction base evidence', 'evidence give witness']"
The only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal positively identifying the applicants had been that given by anonymous police officers.,premise,['evidence identify applicant']
"This was borne out by the fact that Mr Engelen, the one named witness who in the earlier stages of the proceedings had made statements incriminating one of the applicants, had not been granted anonymity and it had not been suggested that he had at any time been threatened.",premise,"['this bear fact', 'who make statement', 'statement incriminate one', '<NAME> grant anonymity']"
The applicants questioned the need to maintain the anonymity of the police officers at all.,conclusion,"['applicant question need', 'need maintain anonymity']"
"In the Court’s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State.",premise,"['favour maintain anonymity', 'balancing raise problem']"
"Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim.",premise,"['interest deserve protection', 'it recognise witness']"
They owe a general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.,premise,"['they owe duty', 'they owe authority', 'use resort circumstance']"
"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification.",conclusion,['need provide justification']
"In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court.",premise,"['case arrest officer', 'duty involve evidence']"
"On the other hand, the Court has recognised in principle that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities, for his own or his family’s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see the above-mentioned Lüdi judgment, p. 21, para. 49).",premise,"['Court recognise principle', 'police authority wish anonymity', 'police authority wish protection', 'agent deploy activity']"
"Having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary.",premise,"['right hold society', 'measure restrict right']"
If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.,premise,[]
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",premise,[]
"It has not been explained to the Court’s satisfaction why it was necessary to resort to such extreme limitations on the right of the accused to have the evidence against them given in their presence, or why less far-reaching measures were not considered.",premise,"['it explain <ORG>', 'evidence give presence']"
"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification.",conclusion,['need provide justification']
"In the present case, the police officers in question were in a separate room with the investigating judge, from which the accused and even their counsel were excluded.",premise,['judge accuse judge']
All communication was via a sound link.,premise,[]
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",conclusion,[]
It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993 (see paragraph 42 above) refers in this connection to the possibilities of using make-up or disguise and the prevention of eye contact.,premise,"['which become Act', 'memorandum refer company nection', 'memorandum refer possibility', 'possibility use make']"
Nor is the Court persuaded that the Court of Appeal made sufficient effort to assess the threat of reprisals against the police officers or their families.,premise,"['Court persuade police officer', '<ORG> make effort', 'effort assess threat']"
It does not appear from that court’s judgment that it sought to address the question whether the applicants would have been in a position to carry out any such threats or to incite others to do so on their behalf.,premise,"['it appear judgment', 'it seek question', 'position carry threat', 'position incite other', 'position incite behalf', 'position do behalf']"
Its decision was based exclusively on the seriousness of the crimes committed,premise,['decision base seriousness']
"In this connection, it is to be noted that Mr Engelen, a civilian witness who in the early stages of the proceedings had made statements identifying one of the applicants as one of the perpetrators, did not enjoy the protection of anonymity and it has not been claimed that he was at any time threatened.",premise,"['who make statement', 'statement identify one', 'statement identify perpetratother', '<NAME> enjoy protection']"
"It is true - as noted by the Government and the Commission (see paragraph 48 above) - that the anonymous police officers were interrogated before an investigating judge, who had himself ascertained their identity and had, in a very detailed official report of his findings, stated his opinion on their reliability and credibility as well as their reasons for remaining anonymous.",premise,"['police officer interrogate judge', 'who ascertain identity', 'judge state opinion']"
However these measures cannot be considered a proper substitute for the possibility of the defence to question the witnesses in their presence and make their own judgment as to their demeanour and reliability.,premise,"['measure not sidere possibility', 'defence question witness', 'defence question presence', 'possibility make judgment']"
It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.,conclusion,['handicap nterbalance procedure']
It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.,premise,['handicap nterbalance procedure']
"Moreover, the only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal which provided positive identification of the applicants as the perpetrators of the crimes were the statements of the anonymous police officers.",premise,['which provide identification']
"That being so the conviction of the applicants was based ""to a decisive extent"" on these anonymous statements.",premise,"['company viction base extent', 'company viction base statement']"
"In the Court’s view, the present case falls to be distinguished from that of Doorson: in the latter case it was decided on the basis of information contained in the case file itself that the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 - who were both civilians, and who knew the accused personally - had sufficient reason to believe that he might resort to violence, and they were heard in the presence of counsel (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, pp. 454-55, para. 25, pp. 455-56, para. 28, and pp. 470-71, paras. 71 and 73).",premise,"['it decide basis', '<ORG> taine case file', 'who know accuse', 'witness have reason', 'he resort violence', 'they hear presence']"
"In addition, in the latter case other evidence providing positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crimes charged was available from sources unrelated to the anonymous witnesses (ibid., pp. 458-59, para. 34, and p. 472, para. 76).",premise,['evidence provide identification']
Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.,conclusion,['proceeding take whole']
This is a borderline case.,premise,[]
"On the one hand, the conditions in which the trial took place and the witnesses were examined were certainly not entirely satisfactory and no doubt they could have been improved, although it has to be acknowledged that efforts had been made in Netherlands law to adapt the procedure for hearing anonymous witnesses to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as set out in the judgment of Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, Series A no. 166).",premise,"['trial take place', 'effort make Netherlands law', 'effort adapt procedure', 'effort adapt requirement', 'procedure hear witness', 'Series A number set judgment']"
"On the other hand, this was a case of armed robbery and it is understandable that the witnesses - even though they were police officers - should be in fear of reprisals from trigger-happy criminals.",premise,[]
"Were a similar situation to arise in the future, it would certainly be desirable for even more attention to be paid to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) when measures were taken.",premise,"['situation arise future', 'attention pay requirement']"
"In the instant case, however, having regard to all the circumstances, we are unable to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) and concur on the whole with the opinion of Judge van Dijk.",conclusion,[]
"I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d)).",premise,"['degree justify case', 'degree justify <NAME>', 'degree distinguish case', 'degree distinguish <NAME>', 'Netherlands find number', 'Netherlands find violation', 'Netherlands judgment act violation']"
"Even though the Court is not bound by precedent, legal certainty and legal equality require that the Court’s case-law be both consistent and transparent as well as reasonably predictable in so far as the facts of the case are comparable to those of earlier cases.",premise,['<ORG> bind precedent']
"Since ""the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (see the previously cited Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67), the applicable national legislation and case-law and the practice followed by the domestic courts are to some extent relevant also for the Court.",premise,"['company assess evidence', 'practice follow company rt']"
The Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment).,premise,"['<ORG> revise case law', '<ORG> revise view', 'case law cerne company dition', 'company viction base statement']"
"Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there).",premise,"['Netherlands Government propose legislature', 'legislature adopt amendment']"
The Act of 1993 was not yet in force when the judgments of the domestic courts in the present case were given.,premise,[]
"However, had it been in force, the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal would have been in conformity with the rules thereby introduced.",premise,[]
"It is true that the reasons listed in the Act for keeping the identity of a witness secret do not include the desirability, for tactical reasons, of not disclosing the identity of a police officer in order not to impair his future effectiveness.",premise,"['reason keep identity', 'reason keep secret', 'reason include desirability', 'number disclose identity', 'desirability impair effectiveness']"
The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).,premise,"['memorandum state word', 'interest investigate crime', 'interest justify company plete anonymity']"
"However, the Court of Appeal did not base its acceptance of the wish of the witnesses to remain anonymous on this reason, but on the fear of the witnesses for their lives and safety and those of their families (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment), which is a ground provided for in Article 226a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",premise,"['<ORG> base acceptance', '<ORG> base reason', 'those see paragraph', 'ground provide article']"
"The foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention.",premise,['foregoing do number']
"However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own.",premise,"['case law have relevance', 'legislation have relevance']"
"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law.",premise,['Strasbourg case law take account']
"Consideration of the various issues involved ultimately led me to the conclusion that Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) have not been violated in the present case.",premise,"['consideration lead I', 'consideration lead company clusion', 'number violate case']"
"It might have been preferable for the Court of Appeal or the investigating judge to have interrogated the witnesses in the presence of counsel and the Procurator General, the accused being able to follow the proceedings in a separate room.",premise,"['<ORG> interrogate witness', '<ORG> interrogate presence']"
I cannot discover from the case file that was before the Court whether this possibility was considered at all.,premise,['I not discover case file']
"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47).",conclusion,"['right examine witness', 'right limit extent', 'defence give opportunity', 'opportunity challenge opportunity', 'opportunity question witness', 'opportunity require article para']"
"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47).",premise,"['right examine witness', 'right limit extent', 'defence give opportunity', 'opportunity challenge opportunity', 'opportunity question witness', 'opportunity require article para']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",conclusion,"['I sider procedure', 'procedure decide procedure', 'procedure follow judge']"
In reaching this conclusion I would stress the following aspects:,premise,['I stress aspect']
"The anonymous witnesses were not interrogated only by a prosecuting authority, but also by an independent and impartial judge who, judging from his official report of his findings to the Court of Appeal, took great care to compensate the defence for the handicap resulting from the lack of a face-to-face confrontation.",premise,"['witness interrogate authority', 'judge judge report', 'who take care', 'care pensate defence', 'handicap result lack']"
The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own.,premise,[]
"In these respects, as was also observed by the Commission, the present case differs from the cases of Kostovski (Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, para. 42), Windisch (Windisch v. Austria judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, p. 10, para. 27), Lüdi (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49), and Saïdi (Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, pp. 56-57, para. 44).",premise,['case differ case']
"The practice in cases such as the present of having witnesses heard by an investigating judge instead of by the trial court itself was accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment as being in conformity with the Convention (loc. cit., p. 471, para. 73).",premise,"['practice have practice', 'witness hear judge', 'practice accept <NAME>']"
The Court of Appeal has given reasons for delegating the hearing of the witnesses to the investigating judge.,premise,"['<ORG> give reason', 'reason delegate hearing', 'reason delegate judge']"
"The weight which the minority of the Commission laid on the fact that the Court of Appeal, being the trial court, did not avail itself of the possibility to assess for itself the reliability of the witnesses, is in my opinion not conclusive; there is no good reason why the court could not rely for this on the assessment of the equally independent and impartial investigating judge.",premise,"['minority lay fact', 'be avail itself', 'be avail possibility', 'possibility assess reliability', 'there be reason', 'rt company rely assessment']"
"In that respect, it is also of relevance that the interrogations before the investigating judge did not take place in a pre-trial phase but during a suspension of the trial before the Court of Appeal and pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal; they formed part of the trial.",premise,"['interrogation take place', 'interrogation take phase', 'they form part']"
"In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43).",premise,"['<ORG> emphasise importance', 'trial judge observe witness', 'one hear judge']"
"The statements made before the investigating judge were statements by witnesses who had been identified by the investigating judge as having been, at the relevant moment, sworn police officers who were authorised to perform prosecuting duties invested with investigative competence and were under oath in relation to any statement made in that context (see the Lüdi judgment previously cited p. 21, para. 49).",premise,"['statement make judge', 'who identify judge', 'who identify police officer', 'who authorise duty', 'police officer perform duty', 'statement make company text']"
"The investigating judge, who had observed the witnesses during the interrogations, gave a reasoned opinion as to their reliability; this was also intended to compensate the defence for being deprived of the visual information which would have permitted them to test the witnesses’ reliability (see the Windisch judgment previously cited, pp. 10-11, paras. 28-29).",premise,"['who observe witness', 'who observe interrogation', 'judge give opinion', 'this intend defence', 'defence deprive information', 'which permit they', 'which permit witnesses reliability', 'information test witnesses reliability']"
The investigating judge gave his reasoned opinion as to whether the wish of the police officers to remain anonymous was justified; these reasons were also found to be justified by the Court of Appeal on the grounds set out in its judgment.,premise,"['judge give opinion', 'reason find ground', 'opinion justify ground', 'ground set judgment']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",conclusion,"['I sider procedure', 'procedure decide procedure', 'procedure follow judge']"
Their shared opinion that the accusations and events were such that fear of violent repercussions was not unsubstantiated cannot be considered unreasonable.,premise,[]
Article 6 (art. 6) does not guarantee an unlimited right to question witnesses.,premise,"['number guarantee right', 'right question witness']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",conclusion,"['I sider procedure', 'procedure decide procedure', 'procedure follow judge']"
"It is necessary not only to recognise the discretion of the competent domestic court in maintaining conformity with the exigencies of the proper administration of justice, but also to balance the interests of the defence under Article 6 (art. 6) against the interests of witnesses protected by other substantive provisions of the Convention (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 70).",premise,"['discretion maintain company formity', 'discretion maintain exigency', 'witness protect provision']"
"Although in the Lüdi judgment (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49) the Court considered the interest of the police authorities in preserving the anonymity of their agents ""legitimate"", greater weight should be given in this case, as was done by the Court of Appeal, to the agents’ interest in the protection of their lives and safety and those of their families (Articles 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention) (art. 2, art. 3, art. 5, art. 8).",premise,"['<ORG> sidere interest', 'interest preserve anonymity', 'weight give case']"
"The defence were given ample opportunity to hear and question the witnesses, and to comment on the recording of their answers, and in fact made extensive use of that opportunity; the technical deficiencies complained of were inconvenient and might perhaps have been avoided, but, given especially the extensive time reserved for the hearings and the detailed way in which the statements were recorded, these deficiencies were not such as to hamper the defence to a significant extent.",premise,"['defence give opportunity', 'opportunity hear recording', 'opportunity question witness', 'time reserve hearing', 'number hamper defence', 'number hamper extent']"
"The Court of Appeal did not exclude beforehand the possibility that additional questions might be put to witnesses at the trial, but was of the opinion that the defence had insufficiently substantiated their wish to do so.",premise,"['<ORG> exclude possibility', 'question put witness', 'question put trial', 'defence substantiate wish']"
"Moreover, the defence were offered the possibility to challenge the statements and their use as evidence in open court before the Court of Appeal.",premise,"['defence offer possibility', 'possibility challenge statement', 'possibility challenge use']"
The convictions were not based solely upon the statements of anonymous witnesses.,premise,[]
"Although these were undoubtedly the core of the evidence, there were also statements by identified witnesses, there was some technical evidence and there was the recording of the telephone conversation.",premise,"['there be statement', 'there be evidence', 'there be recording']"
"In this respect, too, the Court should recognise that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"".",premise,[]
"In the Doorson judgment, in which the criterion of ""decisive extent"" was developed and applied (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), the Court found that this criterion had been met in a situation where the conviction was based, in addition to statements of anonymous witnesses, on a statement made by an identified witness to the police but retracted during the trial and a statement by an identified witness who disappeared before the defence had had the opportunity to question him (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76, in conjunction with pp. 458-59, para. 34).",premise,"['criterion develop <NAME>', 'Court find statement', 'Court find statement', 'criterion meet situation', 'company viction base addition', 'statement make witness', 'statement retract trial', 'defence have opportunity', 'opportunity question he']"
"In view of all these aspects of the case I come to the conclusion that the trial which led to the applicants’ conviction was ""fair"" in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as construed in the Court’s previous case-law.",conclusion,"['I company company clusion', 'which lead applicants company viction']"
"A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable.",premise,"['company sidere plex', 'position judge plex', 'position judge issue', 'which substitute judgment']"
From the wording of the Doorson judgment it is clear that in that case the Court recognised this primary responsibility of the national court.,premise,['Court recognise responsibility']
"The fact that police officers were fired at in pursuit does not necessarily mean that at a later stage, during or after the trial, their lives and safety and/or those of their families were in danger.",premise,['police officer fire pursuit']
"However, on both points the national authorities - in this case the national courts - should be left some latitude to balance the interests of the defence against those of the witnesses (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 71, where a reasonableness test was applied).",premise,"['latitude balance interest', 'latitude balance witness']"
In my opinion the Court of Appeal has not overstepped the mark in finding that the risk of disclosure of the identity of the witnesses was present and that their fear for their lives and safety or those of their families was justified in view of the seriousness of the crimes committed and the violence used.,conclusion,['<ORG> overstep mark']
"In the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., pp. 470-71, para. 71) the Court found that an actual threat against the witnesses was not required for the decision to maintain their anonymity to be reasonable, and that previous experience might be relevant.",premise,"['Court find experience', 'threat require experience', 'decision maintain anonymity']"
In the present case it should also be taken into consideration that some of the witnesses had been wounded while pursuing the robbers.,premise,['it take company sideration']
"Even if one were to take the position that a certain risk is implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve any less protection than that of other persons.",premise,"['that mean it', 'latter have risk', 'life deserve protection', 'safety deserve protection']"
"The ""general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities"" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection.",premise,['judgment owe policeman']
"Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned.",conclusion,['I not agree majority']
It cannot be denied - and indeed it has not been denied - that the possibilities for the defence to interrogate the witnesses were not without limitations.,premise,"['it not deny it', 'defence interrogate witness']"
"Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence.",premise,['identity know defence']
The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise.,premise,"['question answer witness', 'this accept judge', 'witness interrogate form']"
"However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be ""decisive"" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).",premise,"['<ORG> state judgment', 'argument advance witness', 'argument advance anonymity', 'argument claim anonymity', 'it sidere argument', 'argument cerne safety']"
"It may therefore be questioned whether it was necessary and proportionate to refuse to answer certain questions put by the defence in order to protect the anonymity of the witnesses and the secrecy of the police tactics. However, this question has to be answered primarily by the competent domestic court, and indeed it was answered in the affirmative by the investigating judge, and after his decision was challenged by the defence before the Court of Appeal, by the latter as well.",conclusion,"['it question anonymity', 'question put defence', 'question have company', 'it answer affirmative', 'it answer judge', 'decision challenge defence']"
"Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned.",premise,['I not agree majority']
"implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve",premise,"['that mean it', 'latter have risk']"
"It may therefore be questioned whether it was necessary and proportionate to refuse to answer certain questions put by the defence in order to protect the anonymity of the witnesses and the secrecy of the police tactics.

"The applicants argued that if the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal had not relied on the statements of the anonymous police officers, there",premise,['number rely statement']
would have been no case against them and they would have been acquitted.,premise,[]
They each claimed non-pecuniary damage to an amount of 250 Netherlands guilders (NLG) for each day of detention.,conclusion,"['they claim damage', 'they claim day']"
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",premise,[]

Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.,premise,['proceeding take whole']
There has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-1+6-3-d).,conclusion,[]
"The Government and the Commission both considered that there had been no violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d).",premise,[]
"They both considered that the safety of the police officers themselves and their families, and the need not to impair their usefulness in other similar operations, provided sufficient justification for maintaining their anonymity.",conclusion,"['need number impair usefulness', 'safety provide justification', 'need number provide justification', 'justification maintain anonymity']"
