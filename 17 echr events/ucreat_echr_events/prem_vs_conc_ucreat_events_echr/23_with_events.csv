"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.",premise,['law designate reservation']
"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.",premise,['one state section']
"It mattered little in this respect that sections 20 and 52 of the Road Traffic Act, which were applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because those provisions merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Traffic Police Act 1947.",premise,"['it matter respect', 'which apply case', 'provision clarify substance']"

The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.,premise,"['power assess light', 'company sit proceeding']"
"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"".",premise,"['it follow that', 'company plaint raise company', 'company plaint raise applicant', 'that have jurisdiction']"
"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.",premise,"['these include power', 'power quash decision', 'power quash respect', 'power quash question']"
