"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.",premise,['one state section']
"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 17 above).",premise,"['it matter respect', 'which apply case', 'provision clarify substance', 'obligation lay section']"
"According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.",conclusion,"['procedure ere Austrias reservation', 'procedure ere respect']"

"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here",premise,"['wording preclude scope', 'wording preclude sphere']"
"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).",premise,[]
"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions (art. 5, art. 64) applied in the present case are covered by that reservation.",premise,[]
They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.,premise,"['they differ respect', 'they differ issue', 'they differ <NAME>']"

"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.",premise,"['its quash measure', 'it entitle decision', 'it entitle authority company']"
"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.",premise,"['review fine question', 'company ld number regard body']"

"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction""",conclusion,"['decision take authority', 'decision satisfy requirement', 'that have jurisdiction']"

It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).,conclusion,"['it lack power', 'power require article para']"
The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.,premise,"['power assess light', 'company sit proceeding']"
"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"".",conclusion,"['it follow that', 'company plaint raise company', 'company plaint raise applicant', 'that have jurisdiction']"

"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"". There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point.",conclusion,['applicant have access']
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Belilos v. Switzerland judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 24, para. 49).",premise,[]

"(see, as the most recent authority, the Chorherr judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 20).",premise,[]

"Admittedly, it can be inferred from the wording of the ""declaration"" that Austria intended all proceedings that were not ""criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure"" to be excluded from the scope of Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4); the Government rightly drew attention to this.",premise,"['it infer wording', 'Austria intend government', 'proceeding exclude scope', 'government draw attention']"
"Nevertheless, with a description of this nature, which is not exhaustive, the ""declaration"" does not afford to a sufficient degree ""a guarantee ... that [it] does not go beyond the provisions expressly excluded"" by Austria",premise,"['declaration afford guarantee', 'declaration afford degree', 'it go provision']"
"Accordingly, the declaration does not satisfy the requirements of Article 64 para. 2 (art. 64-2).",conclusion,['declaration satisfy requirement']
"Like the Commission, the Court observes that the aim of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) is to prohibit the repetition of criminal proceedings that have been concluded by a final decision.",premise,['that clude decision']

"In the present case, inasmuch as the new proceedings reached their conclusion in a decision later in date than the entry into force of Protocol No. 7 (P7), namely the Administrative Court's judgment of 29 March 1989,",premise,"['proceeding reach company clusion', 'proceeding reach decision']"
the conditions for applicability ratione temporis are satisfied.,conclusion,[]
"The latter were different in nature and pursued different aims: whereas Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code punished homicide committed while under the influence of drink, section 5 of the Road Traffic Act punished the mere fact of driving a vehicle while intoxicated.",premise,"['of punish section', 'fact drive vehicle']"
"The former was designed to penalise acts that cause death and threaten public safety, the latter to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.",premise,"['former design act', 'that cause death', 'act threaten safety', 'latter ensure flow']"
the Government affirmed that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) did not preclude applying the two provisions in issue consecutively.,conclusion,['Article preclude provision']
"The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant.",premise,"['circumstance refer article para', 'number make regard']"
"On the other hand, the administrative authorities found, in order to bring the applicant's case within the ambit of section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, that that alcohol level had been attained.",premise,"['authority find order', 'order bring applicants case', 'order bring ambit']"
"The Court is fully aware that the provisions in question differ not only as regards the designation of the offences but also, more importantly, as regards their nature and purpose.",premise,[]
It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.,premise,"['offence provide section', 'offence represent aspect', 'offence punish article para']"
"Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct.",premise,['decision base company duct']
"Accordingly, there has been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4).",conclusion,[]
"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.",premise,"['procedure follow case', 'offence fall sphere', 'procedure fall sphere']"
This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.,premise,['this reflect terminology']
Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).,premise,"['law refer offence', 'law refer procedure']"
"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 16 above).",premise,"['fine impose applicant', 'fine accompany order', 'his default payment']"
"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention.",conclusion,['offence classify purpose']
