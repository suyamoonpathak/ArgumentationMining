"The Court notes that this particular complaint was not dealt with by the Commission in its report or admissibility decision and that, as pointed out by the Delegate of the Commission, it is uncertain whether it can be regarded as falling within the compass of the case before the Court as delimited by the Commission’s decision on admissibility",premise,"['<ORG> e it', 'number deal decision', 'case delimit <ORG>']"
"(see, inter alia, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 13, para. 29).",premise,[]
"In any event, given the fact that the applicant’s punitive period has now expired, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint.",premise,[]
"The scope of the case before the Court is therefore confined to the issues under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) raised in connection with the applicant’s current situation, that is post-tariff detention.",conclusion,['company fine issue']
"(see paragraph 26 above), which the Court examined in its Wynne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 July 1994 (Series A no. 294-A),",premise,[]
in that the former is not solely based on the gravity of the offence but takes into account the age of the offender.,premise,['number base gravity']
"In the applicant’s submission, a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure differed from the mandatory life sentence imposed on adults",conclusion,"['sentence differ life sentence', 'life sentence impose adult']"
"The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes.",premise,['crime company mitte person']
"In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive.",premise,[]
"In support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 27 and 29 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose.",premise,"['applicant refer origin', 'it have purpose']"
"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 29 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"").",premise,"['he refer wording', 'company victe murder', 'company sentence imprisonment', 'person see paragraph', 'formula use sentence', 'formula use <NAME>']"
"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence.",conclusion,"['applicant company clude indeterminacy', 'applicant company clude case']"
"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence.",premise,"['applicant company clude indeterminacy', 'applicant company clude case']"
"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76).",premise,[]
This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.,premise,[]
"It follows that at that phase in the execution of his sentence, the applicant was entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention and of any re-detention determined by a court at reasonable intervals.",conclusion,"['applicant entitle article para', 're detention determine interval']"
"The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness.",premise,['sentence have character']
This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,premise,"['this explain life sentence', 'this explain policy', 'release procedure govern life sentence', 'release procedure govern sentence', 'life sentence pass adult', 'policy apply paragraph']"
"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 38 above).",premise,"['view maintain company fidence', 'view maintain system']"
"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults.",premise,"['person sentence detention', 'person detain prison', 'person detain stage']"
"In these circumstances, the issues in the present case were practically identical to those in the Wynne case (cited above at paragraph 55) where the Court found that the original trial and appeal proceedings satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",conclusion,"['<NAME> cite paragraph', 'proceeding satisfy requirement']"
"It is true, as submitted by the Government, that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is mandatory: it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion.",premise,"['it fix law', 'person victe murder', 'trial judge have number discretion']"
It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,premise,"['Act treat sentence', 'Act treat manner']"
"On the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word ""life"" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence.",premise,"['expression have purpose', 'word life mention description']"
"Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",premise,"['lawfulness examine rt', 'rt satisfy requirement']"
It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.,premise,['applicant sentence Majestys pleasure']
"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence.",premise,"['company tain element', 'tariff set retribution']"
"However, an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public.",premise,"['term justify company sideration', 'need protect public']"
"These considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older.",premise,"['company sideration centre assessment', 'centre take development', 'centre take account']"
"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",premise,"['that occur maturation', 'person detain section', 'person treat liberty', 'situation give rise', 'situation give question']"
"Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence.",conclusion,[]
The Commission found that the Parole Board’s lack of decision-making power,premise,['<ORG> lack power']
meant that it could not be regarded as a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).,conclusion,"['company ld number regard body', 'body satisfy requirement']"
"As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",premise,"['person detain section', 'opportunity see material', 'person see paragraph', 'Court see number reason', 'number reason depart finding', 'number reason depart case', 'case cite pp']"
"Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government.",premise,"['<ORG> not order release', 'number test government']"
"However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",premise,['lack prevent it']
"As to the need for an oral hearing, the Delegate of the Commission added that judicial review ""is a very uncertain remedy given the fact that express provision is made for an oral hearing in the case of discretionary life prisoners, but not in the case of persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure"".",conclusion,"['Delegate add fact', 'provision make hearing', 'provision make case', 'fact number case', 'person detain Majestys pleasure']"
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow v. Austria judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-B, p. 45, para. 67).",premise,[]
"The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing",conclusion,"['Court recall company text', 'which involve assessment', 'which involve example']"
"The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing",premise,"['Court recall company text', 'which involve assessment', 'which involve example']"
"The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.",premise,"['characteristic pertain personality', 'characteristic pertain level', 'view decide dangerousness', 'view decide article para', 'procedure involve representation', 'procedure involve possibility', 'possibility call possibility', 'possibility question witness']"
It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.,premise,[]
"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about.",premise,"['necessity institute proceeding', 'necessity bring it']"
"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",premise,"['applicants possibility obtain hearing', 'applicants possibility obtain way']"
"In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that the applicant, after the expiry of his tariff, was unable to bring before a court with the powers and procedural guarantees satisfying that provision (art. 5-4) the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure or of his re-detention following the revocation of his licence.",conclusion,"['power satisfy provision art', 're detention follow revocation']"
"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994.",premise,['applicant join scheme']
"He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000.",premise,"['he quantify claim', 'company tinue detention']"
"On the basis of the evidence before it, however, it cannot speculate as to what the applicant’s conduct would have been and whether he would have been eventually released.",conclusion,['it not speculate he']
"He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000.",premise,"['he quantify claim', 'company tinue detention']"
"As to the moral damage allegedly suffered, the Court shares the Government’s view that, in the circumstances, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50).",conclusion,"['Court share governments view', 'finding stitute satisfaction', 'finding stitute purpose']"
"For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax.",premise,"['company t bring case', 'company t bring <ORG>', 'applicant claim sum']"
The Government found the sum claimed excessive.,premise,['sum claim excessive']
"In the light of the criteria emerging from its case-law, the Court holds that the applicant should be awarded the amount of £13,000 less 15,421 French francs already paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees and travel and subsistence expenses.",conclusion,"['criterion emerge case law', '<ORG> hold fee', 'applicant award amount', 'franc pay way']"
"in that theapplicant, after the expiry of his punitive period, wasunable to bring before a court the case of his continueddetention or of his re-detention following the revocationof his licence;",premise,['re detention follow revocationof']
"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention",conclusion,[]
"He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000.",premise,"['he quantify claim', 'company tinue detention']"
"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994.",premise,['applicant join scheme']
