"The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that ""[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred"" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression.",premise,"['clause introduce drafting stage', 'state party declare offence', 'idea base superiority', 'company ld give rise', 'company ld give difficulty']"
"In the applicant’s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers’ Deputies on 31 October 1968).",premise,"['they add statement', 'they add instrument']"

"The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia.",premise,"['it seek attention', 'it seek matter']"

Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast.,premise,['majority view news programme']
"Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme.",premise,"['they incur liability', 'applicant encourage <ORG>', 'applicant encourage statement']"

"No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints,",conclusion,"['weight company attach fact', 'programme give rise', 'programme give company plaint']"
The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences,premise,[]

He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions.,premise,"['he edit programme', 'he edit way', 'way include assertion']"

The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above).,premise,['number justify dissemination']
"However, in view of the principles stated in paragraph 31 above, the Court sees no cause to question the Sunday News Magazine staff members’ own appreciation of the news or information value of the impugned item, which formed the basis for their decisions to produce and broadcast it.",premise,"['principle state paragraph', '<ORG> see number cause', 'number cause question appreciation', 'which form basis', 'decision produce decision', 'decision broadcast it']"

"Admittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race.",premise,"['number recall immorality danger', 'number recall unlawfulness']"
"However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used,",premise,"['limitation spell element', 'limitation spell item']"
the Court does not consider the absence of such precautionary reminders to be relevant.,conclusion,[]
"Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of ""the protection of the reputation or rights of others"", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest.",premise,['bound set interest']

"Accordingly, the findings of the Danish courts cannot be considered as giving rise to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.",conclusion,['finding not sidere rise']
"A journalist’s good intentions are not enough in such a situation, especially in a case in which he has himself provoked the racist statements.",premise,['he provoke statement']

"The Danish courts fully recognised that protection of persons whose human dignity is attacked has to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression. They carefully considered the responsibility of the applicant, and the reasons for their conclusions were relevant.",premise,"['protection have right', 'they sidere responsibility']"
"The protection of racial minorities cannot have less weight than the right to impart information, and in the concrete circumstances of the present case it is in our opinion not for this Court to substitute its own balancing of the conflicting interests for that of the Danish Supreme Court.",premise,"['protection not have weight', 'right impart information', 'Court substitute balancing']"
We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area.,conclusion,"['company act margin', 'which leave area']"

"In this context, the Government pointed out that the former provision had been enacted in order to comply with the UN Convention.",premise,[]
"The Government’s argument, as the Court understands it, is that, whilst Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention is applicable, the Court, in applying paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), should consider that the relevant provisions of the Penal Code are to be interpreted and applied in an extensive manner, in accordance with the rationale of the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above).",premise,['court understand it']

"It is moreover undisputed that this interference was ""prescribed by law""",conclusion,['interference prescribe law']
