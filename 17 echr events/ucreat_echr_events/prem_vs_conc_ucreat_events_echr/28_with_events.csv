The applicant considered that the law of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to establish in advance whether in the eyes of a jury a particular publication would constitute an offence.,premise,['publication stitute offence']
"Moreover, it was practically impossible to know what predictions an administrative body - the British Board of Film Classification - would make as to the outcome of a hypothetical prosecution.",premise,[]
"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations.",conclusion,['applicant company ld number expect result']
"In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations.",premise,['applicant company ld number expect result']
"The requirement of foreseeability which flows from the expression ""prescribed by law"" was therefore not fulfilled.",conclusion,"['which flow expression', 'expression prescribe law']"
it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts.,premise,['tribunal reach company clusion']
This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable.,premise,[]
"Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing ""contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible"" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous.",premise,"['way publish matter', 'matter relate matter', 'law seek detail']"
The Government contested this claim:,conclusion,['<ORG> test claim']
"The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national ""law"", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail.",premise,"['which include statute', 'which include law', 'precision enable company', 'precision enable advice', 'precision enable degree', 'precision enable circumstance', 'precision foresee degree', 'precision foresee circumstance']"
"A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31).",premise,"['that fer discretion', 'scope indicate clarity', 'manner indicate clarity', 'aim give individual', 'aim give protection']"
"It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant’s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 24 above).",premise,"['it infringe provision', '<ORG> act power', '<ORG> act section']"
The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition.,premise,"['offence not lend itself', 'offence not lend definition']"
"National authorities must therefore be afforded a degree of flexibility in assessing whether the facts of a particular case fall within the accepted definition of the offence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky judgment cited above at paragraph 40, p. 73, para. 41).",conclusion,"['authority afford degree', 'fact fall definition', '<NAME> cite paragraph para']"
"In his submission, the expression ""rights of others"" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended.",premise,['expression right refer right number']
It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people’s viewing the video work without being shocked.,premise,"['right avoid disturbance', 'people view video work']"
"The applicant contested the Government’s assertion that his video work was refused a certificate for distribution in order to ""protect the right of citizens not to be offended in their religious feelings"".",conclusion,"['applicant company test <ORG>', 'video work refuse certificate', '<ORG> protect right', 'right offend feeling']"
"Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the ""necessity"" of the interference.",premise,"['there be need', 'matter assess necessity']"
It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith.,premise,['law extend faith']
"Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above).",premise,['anomaly recognise paragraph']
"However, it is not for the European Court to rule in abstracto as to the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention.",premise,[]
The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it,premise,['law protect belief']
The uncontested fact that the law of blasphemy does not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the United Kingdom does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim pursued in the present context.,premise,"['law treat religion', 'law treat footing', 'fact detract legitimacy', 'aim pursue company text']"
The refusal to grant a certificate for the distribution of Visions of Ecstasy consequently had a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).,conclusion,"['refusal grant certificate', 'refusal have aim', 'refusal have article para']"
The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it,premise,['law protect belief']
"(see, for example, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 18, para. 33).",conclusion,[]
The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.,premise,['company stitute one']
"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities.",premise,"['exercise carry duty', 'exercise carry responsibility']"
"Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49).",premise,"['duty avoid .', 'expression see <ORG>', '<ORG> cite paragraph pp']"
"No restriction on freedom of expression, whether in the context of religious beliefs or in any other, can be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) unless it satisfies, inter alia, the test of necessity as required by the second paragraph of that Article (art. 10-2).",conclusion,"['it satisfy test', 'test require paragraph']"
"indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed.",premise,[]
"Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice.",premise,['protection provide panoply']
"In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued.",premise,"['company taine number obscenity number pornography', 'company taine number element']"
"According to the applicant, there was no ""pressing social need"" to ban a video work on the uncertain assumption that it would breach the law of blasphemy;",conclusion,"['there be need', 'need ban video work', 'need ban assumption', 'it breach law']"
This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings.,premise,"['argument present applicant', 'argument present company']"
"Moreover, it was open to the applicant to challenge the decision of the Appeals Committee in proceedings for judicial review (see paragraph 30 above).",premise,[]
"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",conclusion,"['threshold embody definition', 'reason justify measure', 'reason sidere purpose']"
"Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive.",premise,[]
"It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46).",premise,"['it submit applicant', 'video work reach audience', 'feature film cite paragraph']"
The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.,conclusion,"['Christian view video', 'need impose restriction', 'need impose distribution']"
"Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above).",premise,"['risk company reduce distribution', 'ld reduce distribution']"
"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it.",premise,"['film dispense video box', 'which include description']"
"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities.",premise,[]
"In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence.",premise,"['authority bear development', 'authority bear mind', 'authority see paragraph', 'authority see company sider', '<ORG> reach public', 'it cause offence']"
The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above.,premise,"['box include warning', 'use see paragraph']"
"In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public.",premise,"['position make assessment', 'position take difficulty', 'position take account', 'difficulty protect public']"
It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution.,premise,"['measure take authority', 'measure amount ban']"
"However, this was an understandable consequence of the opinion of the competent authorities that the distribution of the video would infringe the criminal law and of the refusal of the applicant to amend or cut out the objectionable sequences (see paragraph 13 above).",premise,"['distribution infringe law', 'refusal amend refusal', 'refusal cut sequence', 'company sequence see paragraph']"
Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.,conclusion,['authority overstep margin']
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",premise,"['fact remain company ground', 'there be company ground', '<ORG> impose restriction', '<ORG> impose basis']"
In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.,premise,[]
It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.,premise,[]
"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",premise,"['threshold embody definition', 'reason justify measure', 'reason sidere purpose']"
The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.,premise,"['Christian view video', 'need impose restriction', 'need impose distribution']"
Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.,premise,['authority overstep margin']
Against this background the national authorities were entitled to consider that the impugned measure was justified as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Art. 10-2). There has therefore been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (Art. 10).,conclusion,[]
"Admittedly, it is regrettable that the protection afforded by this legislation does not apply to other religions, for such a limitation makes no sense in 1996 now that we have the United Nations and UNESCO instruments on tolerance.",premise,"['protection afford legislation', 'protection apply religion', 'limitation make number sense', 'limitation make number', 'we have <ORG>', 'we have <ORG>']"
"However, the European Convention on Human Rights does not, on the one hand, prohibit legislation of this type, which is found in a number of member States, and, on the other hand, it leaves scope for review under Article 14 (art. 14).",premise,"['European Convention number hand', 'European Convention number legislation', 'which find number', 'it leave scope', 'it leave article']"
In the present case no complaint had been made to the European Court under that Article (art. 14).,premise,['number company plaint make article art']
The Court had to decide the case under Article 10 (art. 10).,conclusion,"['Court have case', 'Court have article']"
"instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had been a video showing, for example, the anti-clerical Voltaire having sexual relations with some prince or king.",premise,"['video show example', '<NAME> have relation', '<NAME> have prince']"
The decision not to grant a certificate might possibly have been justifiable and justified if,conclusion,['decision number grant certificate']
"What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works.",premise,"['I write subject', 'I write judge', 'I write case', 'write apply number', 'write apply press', 'write apply form', 'form include video work']"
"Judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 46",premise,[]
"This was a pure case of prior restraint, a form of interference which is, in my view, unacceptable in the field of freedom of expression.",conclusion,[]
Section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984,premise,[]
"Of course, anything so decided by such authority needs reasonable justification and must not be arbitrary.",premise,['anything need justification']
"It must, if contested, be subject to judicial review, and it must not have the effect of preventing the courts from deciding, as the case may be, whether the work concerned deserves, or does not deserve, any sanction under existing law.",premise,"['it have effect', 'effect prevent company', 'company deserve work', 'work deserve sanction', 'work deserve law']"
"Under the system established by the Video Recordings Act 1984 the British Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee may determine that certain video works are not suitable for being classified in any of its three categories , and they can thus ban them absolutely ab initio.",conclusion,"['<ORG> determine they', 'number classify category', 'they ban they']"
This was indeed what actually happened in respect of the piece in issue in the present case.,premise,['what happen respect']
It certainly goes too far. 4.,premise,[]
"To the extent that the criminal law of blasphemy might have been infringed by the applicant, I would observe that the necessity of such laws is very much open to question.",premise,['law infringe applicant']
"I would rather join Mr Patten’s remark that for the faithful ""the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers"" .",conclusion,['I join <NAME>']
"I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society"".",premise,[]
The British Board of Film Classification and the five-member panel of the VAC took the view that the applicant would commit an offence of blasphemy if his video work Visions of Ecstasy were to be distributed (see paragraph 20 of the judgment).,premise,"['<ORG> take view', 'member panel take view']"
In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference.,premise,"['there be interference', 'member call interference']"
The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.,premise,"['interference base opinion', 'they understand feeling']"
The actual opinion of believers remains unknown.,premise,[]
"I think that this is why we cannot conclude that the interference corresponded to a ""pressing social need"".",conclusion,['interference company respond need']
"The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment).",premise,['law protect religion']
The aim of the interference was therefore to protect the Christian faith alone and not other beliefs.,conclusion,[]
"As the Court has consistently held, the guarantees enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) apply not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that shock or disturb.",premise,"['<ORG> hold guarantee', 'guarantee enshrine article', 'that receive information']"
Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity.,premise,"['impression veye image', 'impression veye situation', 'which shock image', 'image disturb feeling']"
"In my view, the makers of the film in issue did not exceed the reasonable limit beyond which it can be said that objects of religious veneration have been reviled or ridiculed.",conclusion,"['maker exceed limit', 'number exceed limit', 'it say limit', 'object revile limit']"
"since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith.",premise,"['it base law', 'law limit protection']"
In any event - the applicant further submitted - the restriction on the film’s distribution could not pursue a legitimate aim,conclusion,['restriction pursue aim']
"The Government contended that the applicant’s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive.",premise,"['<ORG> tend it', 'it amount attack']"
"In those circumstances, in refusing to grant a classification certificate for the applicant’s video work, the national authorities only acted within their margin of appreciation.",conclusion,['authority act margin']
"The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above).",premise,"['refusal grant Visions', 'refusal grant distribution certificate', 'refusal intend right']"
The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context.,premise,"['applicant make reference', 'law see paragraph', 'which pursue aim']"
"As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries.",premise,"['observation file intervenother', 'observation see paragraph']"
It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.,premise,"['application become States', 'States repeal they']"
In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above).,premise,"['prosecution cerne blasphemy', 'prosecution bring year']"
"Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above).",premise,"['argument advance example', 'law discriminate faith']"
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",conclusion,"['fact remain company ground', 'there be company ground', '<ORG> impose restriction', '<ORG> impose basis']"
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49).",premise,['Otto Preminger Institut judgment cite paragraph para']
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",conclusion,"['fact remain company ground', 'there be company ground', '<ORG> impose restriction', '<ORG> impose basis']"
"Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ""the protection of the rights of others"" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions.",premise,['there be company ception']
"What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations.",premise,"['be vary time', 'be vary place', 'be vary era', 'era characterise array']"
"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35).",premise,"['position give opinion', 'restriction intend those', 'restriction intend material', 'restriction protect those', 'restriction protect material']"
This does not of course exclude final European supervision.,premise,"['this exclude supervision', 'number exclude supervision']"
Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material,premise,['action take material']
In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.,conclusion,[]
"Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60).",premise,"['case involve restraint', 'fact call scrutiny', 'call see mutatis mutandis']"
The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).,premise,"['reason rely authority', 'reason justify measure', 'measure interfere applicants freedom']"
"As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion.",premise,['law prohibit expression']
Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit.,premise,['opinion fall ambit']
"As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control.",premise,['company indicate paragraph']
"The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness.",premise,['use depict material']
"The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness.",premise,['degree stitute safeguard']
It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.,conclusion,[]
