"It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"". The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"". The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.",premise,"['issue summarise paragraph', 'issue relate definition', 'company send to', 'removal flict definition', 'it prevent word', '<ORG> examine strand', 'strand include argument', 'term exclude intercourse', 'term exclude definition']"
"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37). It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word ""unlawful"" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from ""removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive"" and from declaring that ""a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim"" (see paragraph 14 above).",premise,"['it see number reason', 'number reason disagree company clusion', 'number inhibit they', 'number inhibit law fiction', 'number inhibit paragraph', 'which become law fiction', 'rapist remain rapist']"
"The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 14 and 20-25 above).",premise,"['case law development dismantle immunity', 'number see paragraph']"
"Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape.",premise,"['there be evolution', 'evolution treat company duct']"
"The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 32 above).",premise,"['applicant company victe rape', 'result not say object', 'number subject prosecution company viction']"
"What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom.",premise,[]
"Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to enquire into whether the facts in the applicant’s case were covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already made by the English courts before 12 November 1989. 44. In short, the Court, like the Government and the Commission, finds that the national courts’ decisions that the applicant could not invoke immunity",conclusion,"['fact ere exception', 'immunity rule make company', 'company rt decision', 'applicant company ld number invoke immunity']"
"(see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).",premise,[]
"In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law",conclusion,[]
"The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency.",premise,"['guarantee enshrine article art', 'be occupy place']"
"It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment.",premise,['way provide safeguard']
"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy.",premise,"['Court hold Kokkinakis Greece judgment', 'it embody principle', 'it embody principle', 'law define crime', 'principle prescribe penalty', 'law strue detriment', 'law strue instance', 'law strue analogy']"
From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.,conclusion,['offence define law']
"(see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37)",premise,[]
"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability",conclusion,"['art speak law', 'Convention refer company cept', 'company cept use term', 'company prise law', 'law write law', 'company cept imply requirement', 'requirement number accessibility']"
"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition",premise,"['system include law', 'there be element']"
There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances.,conclusion,[]
From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.,premise,['offence define law']
"In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.",premise,"['Court add act', 'Court add omission', 'individual know wording']"
"The Court thus indicated that when speaking of ""law"" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability",premise,"['art speak law', 'Convention refer company cept', 'company cept use term', 'company prise law', 'law write law', 'company cept imply requirement', 'requirement number accessibility']"
"However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances.",premise,"['system include law', 'there be element']"
"Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen. B. Application of the foregoing principles",conclusion,[]
"The issue was never resolved by the national courts, as the sole ground on which the applicant’s conviction rested was in fact the removal of the common law fiction by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.",premise,['issue never resolve removal']
"Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied.",premise,[]
"Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law.",premise,"['<ORG> create offence', 'they extend offence', 'they extend company duct', 'which exclude company mon law']"
They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes.,premise,"['company ld number say law', 'company ld number say kind']"
"To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent.",premise,[]
"Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred. In November 1989, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary.",premise,[]
"The applicant further argued that in examining his complaint under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention, the Court should not consider his conduct in relation to any of the exceptions to the immunity rule.",conclusion,"['Court number company sider', 'Court number relation']"
The Government and the Commission were of the view that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape.,premise,['there be doubt']
This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable.,premise,['there be indication']
"In particular, given the recognition of women’s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant.",premise,[]
He was not convicted of conduct which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was committed.,conclusion,[]
"In addition, the Government pointed out, on the basis of agreed facts Mr Justice Owen had found that there was an implied agreement between the applicant and his wife to separation and to withdrawal of the consent to intercourse.",premise,"['Government point applicant', 'Government point agreement', '<NAME> find applicant', '<NAME> find agreement', 'there be agreement', 'withdrawal send intercourse']"
The circumstances in his case were thus covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already stated by the English courts.,conclusion,"['circumstance ere exception', 'immunity rule state company']"
"A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity.",premise,['succession affirm principle']
"It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 12 November 1989 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted.",premise,[]
"The removal of the immunity by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991 and the House of Lords on 23 October 1991 occurred by way of direct reversal, not clarification, of the law. When the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 17 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed. On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon. In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created.",premise,"['removal occur way', '<ORG> debate Bill', 'advice await report', 'that abolish immunity', '<ORG> recommend exception', 'immunity maintain exception']"
"In 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word ""unlawful"" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 17 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect. On 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above).",premise,"['<ORG> have opportunity', 'opportunity take word', 'opportunity introduce provision']"
"However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal’s and the House of Lords’ rulings in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).",premise,['debate empte paragraph']
"The applicant maintained that the general common law principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife, albeit subject to certain limitations, was still effective on 12 November 1989, when he committed the acts which gave rise to the charge of attempted rape paragraph 10 above).",conclusion,"['husband company ld number find guilty', 'he mitte act', 'which give rise', 'which give paragraph']"
"Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7)",premise,['Court hold Kokkinakis Greece judgment']
"is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy.",conclusion,"['it embody principle', 'it embody principle', 'law define crime', 'principle prescribe penalty', 'law strue detriment', 'law strue instance', 'law strue analogy']"
