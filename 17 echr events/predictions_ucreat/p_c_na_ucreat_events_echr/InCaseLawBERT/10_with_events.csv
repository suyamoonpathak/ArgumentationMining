"It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: ""unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it"". The question was whether ""removal"" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word ""unlawful"". The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term ""unlawful"" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.",premise,"['issue summarise paragraph', 'issue relate definition', 'company send to', 'removal flict definition', 'it prevent word', '<ORG> examine strand', 'strand include argument', 'term exclude intercourse', 'term exclude definition']",1,0.3516672,0.63939947,0.008933352,Premise
