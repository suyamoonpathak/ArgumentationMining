Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies one of the most important changes was that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband,non-argumentative,['marriage regard partnership'],0,0.5700732,0.42992672,Non-Argumentative
Hale's proposition involved that by marriage a wife gave her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happened to be feeling at the time,non-argumentative,"['wife give she', 'wife give company', 'wife give circumstance', 'wife give state', 'company send intercourse', 'she happen time', 'state feel time']",0,0.572157,0.42784303,Non-Argumentative
In modern times any reasonable person had to regard that conception as quite unacceptable.,non-argumentative,['person have company ception'],0,0.54196674,0.4580332,Non-Argumentative
The position was that part of Hale's proposition had been departed from in a series of decided cases.,non-argumentative,['part depart series'],0,0.6170372,0.38296288,Non-Argumentative
On the ground of principle there was no good reason why the whole proposition of 'marital exemption' to rape should not be held inapplicable in modern times.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'proposition hold inapplicable', 'proposition hold time']",0,0.55700266,0.4429973,Non-Argumentative
The only question was whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presented an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course.,non-argumentative,['section present obstacle'],0,0.5623713,0.43762872,Non-Argumentative
The argument was that 'unlawful' in that subsection meant outside the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,['that mean bond'],0,0.56354195,0.436458,Non-Argumentative
That was not the most natural meaning of the word which normally described something which was contrary to some law or enactment or was done without lawful justification or excuse.,non-argumentative,"['which describe something', 'word do justification']",0,0.54328895,0.45671105,Non-Argumentative
Certainly in modern times sexual intercourse outside marriage would not ordinarily be described as unlawful.,non-argumentative,[],0,0.63918924,0.36081073,Non-Argumentative
If the subsection proceeded on the basis that a woman on marriage gave a general consent to sexual intercourse there could be no question of intercourse with her by her husband being without consent.,non-argumentative,"['subsection proceed basis', 'woman give company', 'company send intercourse']",0,0.5622415,0.43775848,Non-Argumentative
There would thus be no point in enacting that only intercourse without consent outside marriage was to constitute rape.,non-argumentative,['company send marriage'],0,0.5802768,0.41972324,Non-Argumentative
"There was another important context to section 1 (1), namely the existence of the exceptions to the marital exemption established by cases decided before the Act was passed.",non-argumentative,"['there be company text', 'exception establish case']",0,0.55576,0.44423997,Non-Argumentative
Sexual intercourse in any of the cases covered by the exceptions still took place within the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,"['case ere exception', 'intercourse take place', 'intercourse take bond']",0,0.5745865,0.4254135,Non-Argumentative
So if 'unlawful' in the subsection meant 'outside the bond of marriage' it followed that sexual intercourse in a case which fell within the exceptions was not covered by the definition of rape not- withstanding that it was not consented to by the wife.,non-argumentative,"['unlawful mean bond', 'which fall exception', 'number company ere definition', 'number company sente to', 'number company sente wife']",0,0.559868,0.44013202,Non-Argumentative
That involved that the exceptions had been impliedly abolished.,non-argumentative,[],0,0.63918924,0.36081073,Non-Argumentative
If the intention of Parliament was to abolish the exceptions it would have been expected to do so expressly and it was in fact inconceivable Parliament should have had such an intention.,non-argumentative,"['it expect it', '<ORG> have intention']",0,0.5592202,0.44077983,Non-Argumentative
In order that the exceptions might be preserved it would be necessary to construe 'unlawfully' so as to give it a meaning unique to that particular subsection and if the mind of the draughtsman has been directed to the existence of the exceptions he would surely have dealt with them specifically and not in such an oblique fashion.,non-argumentative,['mind direct existence'],0,0.5646202,0.4353798,Non-Argumentative
The fact was it was clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent and that the use of the word in the subsection added nothing.,non-argumentative,['use add number hing'],0,0.55096954,0.44903043,Non-Argumentative
There were no rational grounds for putting the suggested gloss on the word and it should be treated as mere surplusage in the enactment.,non-argumentative,"['there be ground', 'ground put gloss', 'ground put word', 'it treat surplusage']",0,0.5662259,0.43377417,Non-Argumentative
