"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 29 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"").",premise,"['he refer wording', 'company victe murder', 'company sentence imprisonment', 'person see paragraph', 'formula use sentence', 'formula use <NAME>']",1,0.077337995,0.922662,Premise

"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76).",premise,[],1,0.18063541,0.8193646,Premise
This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.,premise,[],1,0.18063541,0.8193646,Premise
"It follows that at that phase in the execution of his sentence, the applicant was entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention and of any re-detention determined by a court at reasonable intervals.",conclusion,"['applicant entitle article para', 're detention determine interval']",1,0.07404304,0.92595696,Premise

This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,premise,"['this explain life sentence', 'this explain policy', 'release procedure govern life sentence', 'release procedure govern sentence', 'life sentence pass adult', 'policy apply paragraph']",1,0.07694464,0.92305535,Premise

"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults.",premise,"['person sentence detention', 'person detain prison', 'person detain stage']",1,0.07384507,0.926155,Premise
"In these circumstances, the issues in the present case were practically identical to those in the Wynne case (cited above at paragraph 55) where the Court found that the original trial and appeal proceedings satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",conclusion,"['<NAME> cite paragraph', 'proceeding satisfy requirement']",1,0.078300714,0.9216993,Premise

"Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",premise,"['lawfulness examine rt', 'rt satisfy requirement']",1,0.0762707,0.92372936,Premise

"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",premise,"['that occur maturation', 'person detain section', 'person treat liberty', 'situation give rise', 'situation give question']",1,0.07345731,0.9265427,Premise
