The argument was that 'unlawful' in that subsection meant outside the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,['that mean bond'],0,0.6972552,0.30274487,Non-Argumentative

So if 'unlawful' in the subsection meant 'outside the bond of marriage' it followed that sexual intercourse in a case which fell within the exceptions was not covered by the definition of rape not- withstanding that it was not consented to by the wife.,non-argumentative,"['unlawful mean bond', 'it follow ', 'which fall exception', ' ere definition', ' sente wife']",1,0.38127714,0.61872286,Argumentative
