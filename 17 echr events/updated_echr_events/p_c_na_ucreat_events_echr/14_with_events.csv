"The first is that for the applicant and his wife the choice in question was not only between renouncing their son or renouncing the position which they had acquired in Switzerland, but also between renouncing their son Ersin or their little daughter Nursal who was being educated in a home in Switzerland and whose interests almost certainly would have required that she should be left behind.",premise,"[' renounce son', ' renounce position', 'they have acquire switzerland', ' renounce son', 'who be be educate home', 'interest would have require ', 'she should be leave ']"

"The fourth is that the applicant and his wife deserve compassion: whilst his wife had been suffering from epilepsy since 1982 and had a terrible accident in 1987, the applicant himself became disabled in 1990.",premise,"['applicant deserve passion', 'wife have be suffer epilepsy', 'wife have be suffer 1982', 'wife have accident', 'wife have 1987', 'applicant become 1990']"
Under these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey.,conclusion,"['it be require applicant', 'number be require applicant', ' to be reunite ersin', 'they should leave switzerland', 'they return turkey']"

"It follows that a proper balance was not achieved between the interests involved, that the refusal of the Swiss authorities is disproportionate and, as such, not necessary in a democratic society. I thus conclude that there was a violation of Article 8 (art. 8).",conclusion,"['it follow ', 'i clude ', 'there be violation']"
On 19 September 1990 there certainly was a family life relationship between the applicant and Ersin.,premise,[]
"Since Ersin was born from the legitimate marriage between the applicant and his wife,",premise,['ersin be bear marriage']

"As a matter of well-established international law and subject to its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory (see, among other authorities, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, para. 67).",premise,"['state have right', ' to trol entry', ' see judgment', ' see authority']"
"Moreover, where immigration is concerned, Article 8 (art. 8) cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.",premise,"['immigration be cerne ', ' to impose obligation', ' to impose state', ' to respect choice', ' to authorise reunion']"
"In order to establish the scope of the State’s obligations, the facts of the case must be considered (see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 68, and the Cruz Varas and Others v.

"It follows that the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland amounts to a violation of Article 8 (art. 8), unless it is deemed justified under paragraph 2 of that Article (art. 8-2) or under similar principles to those enshrined therein.",conclusion,"['it follow ', ' to grant authorisation', ' to reside switzerland', 'refusal amount violation', 'it be deem justify', 'it be deem paragraph']"

"In a decision of 19 September 1990 the Aliens Police rejected Mr Gül’s request, on the ground that the conditions for family reunion had not been satisfied (Article 39 of the OLNA - see paragraph 21 below).",non-argumentative,"['police reject request', 'police reject ground', 'dition have be satisfy article', ' see paragraph']"
"Firstly, the Gül family’s flat did not conform to the standards laid down and, secondly, the applicant did not have sufficient means to provide for his family.",non-argumentative,"['flat do form', 'flat do standard', 'applicant do have mean', ' to provide family']"
"In any event, Tuncay was already eighteen and was therefore ineligible for a residence permit under the rules governing family reunion.",non-argumentative,[' govern reunion']
On 1 October 1990 the applicant appealed against this decision to the Basle Rural cantonal government (Regierungsrat).,non-argumentative,"['applicant appeal decision', 'applicant appeal government']"
"He argued that the residence permit issued to him and his wife under Article 13 (f) of the OLNA should have been extended to include his two sons, as his personal circumstances made it an extremely serious case.",non-argumentative,"['he argue ', ' issue f', 'permit should have be extend ', ' to include son', 'circumstance make ']"
"Since it was impossible to return to Turkey because of his wife’s precarious state of health and the length of time he had lived abroad, the family could be brought back together only in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"[' to return turkey', 'he have live ', 'company be bring switzerland']"
"Both Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing the right to respect for family life, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child gave the two boys the right to join their parents in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"[' guarantee right', ' to respect life', 'convention give right', ' to join parent', ' to join switzerland']"
"If the cantonal government were nevertheless to rely on the provisions of Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) on family reunion, the younger son, Ersin, could and should be permitted to exercise that right.",non-argumentative,"[' to rely provision', ' see paragraph', ' see reunion', 'son should be permit ', ' to exercise right']"
There was enough room for him in the family’s flat and Mr Gül’s financial resources were sufficient to provide for his family.,non-argumentative,"['there be room', 'there be flat', ' to provide family']"
On 30 July 1991 the Basle Rural cantonal government dismissed the applicant’s appeal.,non-argumentative,['government dismiss appeal']
"It pointed out that under section 4 of the Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act (""the RSAA"" - see paragraph 20 below) the question whether to grant a residence permit (Aufenthaltsbewilligung) or settlement permit (Niederlassungsbewilligung) was determined by the competent cantonal authorities with unfettered discretion (nach freiem Ermessen), having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and international agreements.",non-argumentative,"['it point ', ' see paragraph', ' to grant permit', 'question be determine authority', 'question be determine ermessen', ' have regard']"
"In that connection, the authorities had to take account of the country’s moral and economic interests, and of the degree of immigrant penetration (Überfremdung).",non-argumentative,"['authority have ', ' to take account', ' to take interest']"
"The cantonal government then considered whether Mr Gül’s two sons could rely on a right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland (Anwesenheitsbewilligung) on the basis of the statutory provisions, as the agreement on settlement concluded by Turkey and Switzerland on 13 December 1990 did not confer such a right.",non-argumentative,"['government sidere ', 'ld rely right', 'ld rely basis', ' to obtain permission', ' to reside switzerland', ' clude turkey', ' clude december']"
Under section 17 (2) of the RSAA (see paragraph 20 below) a minor did not have such a right unless his parent was in possession of a settlement permit.,non-argumentative,"[' see paragraph', 'minor do have right']"
"As Mr and Mrs Gül only had a residence permit, they could not rely on that provision in order to assert a right to family reunion.",non-argumentative,"['gl have permit', 'number rely provision', ' to assert right']"
"As for the guarantees set forth in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, only Swiss nationals or persons in possession of a settlement permit could rely on these; Mr and Mrs Gül fell into neither of those categories.",non-argumentative,"[' set art', ' fall neither']"
Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) did not confer a right but merely set out the minimum conditions to be satisfied before family reunion could be authorised.,non-argumentative,"[' see paragraph', 'company set dition', 'ld be authorise ']"
"The cantonal authorities had the final say on the matter, and in reaching their decision they had unfettered discretion.",non-argumentative,"['authority have say', ' reach decision', 'they have discretion']"
"It being established that the provisions concerned could only apply, if at all, to the minor son, Ersin, the cantonal government listed the minimum conditions which Article 39 para. 1 of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) required to be satisfied by a foreigner living in Switzerland before family reunion could be authorised, namely:",non-argumentative,"['it be establish ', 'provision apply son', 'government list dition', '1 see paragraph', ' to be satisfy foreigner', ' live switzerland', 'ld be authorise ']"

"The cantonal government did not determine points (a) and (b), but carefully considered points (c) and (d), on which it gave the following decision:",non-argumentative,"['government do give decision', 'it do give decision']"
"The calculations made by the Aliens Police and the cantonal government’s legal service, which investigated the case, show that Mr Gül has not satisfied the condition laid down in Article 39 para. 1 (c) of the OLNA.",non-argumentative,"[' make police', 'which investigate case', 'calculation show ', 'number have satisfy dition', ' lay para']"
He does not have sufficient means to support his family during their residence in Switzerland.,non-argumentative,"['he do have mean', ' to support family', ' to support residence']"
"According to the reference calculation, Mr Gül should have a monthly net income of at least 2,710 Swiss francs (CHF) if he is not to fall below the minimum standard of living.",non-argumentative,"[' accord calculation', 'gl should have income', ' to fall standard']"
"That figure is derived from the base rates used by the cantonal social security office for assessing the likelihood of reliance on social security, which are on the whole identical with the base rates adopted by the Swiss Conference on Public Assistance for the calculation of financial support.",non-argumentative,"['figure be derive rate', ' use office', ' assess likelihood', ' adopt conference', ' adopt calculation']"
"These base rates are used to establish the monthly living expenses of the foreigner concerned and the members of his family seeking to join him, which have to be covered by his income.",non-argumentative,"['rate be use ', ' to establish expense', ' to join he', 'which have ', ' to be ere income']"
This must be sufficient to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also a minimum standard of living.,non-argumentative,[' to provide number']
In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account.,non-argumentative,"[' prevent family', ' become burden', 'interest be take account']"
"Mr Gül’s net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which falls CHF 650 short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services.",non-argumentative,"['which fall ', ' require standard', ' calculate service']"
"The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home has not been taken into account, as it is not known who pays for this.",non-argumentative,"[' keep child', ' keep home', 'number have be take account', 'who pay this']"
"The calculation of income is based on pay-slips from 1989, the latest available.",non-argumentative,['calculation be base slip']
On 23 October 1990 the Liestal Cantonal Hospital sent the Basle Rural Aliens Police a medical certificate stating that Mr Gül was 100% unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine.,non-argumentative,"['hospital send certificate', 'gl would remain period']"
"On enquiry being made, it was confirmed in a medical certificate dated 19 April 1991 that Mr Gül had suffered from 100% incapacity since April 1990 and would remain unfit for work for the foreseeable future.",non-argumentative,"['enquiry be make ', 'it be firm certificate', 'gl have suffer incapacity', 'gl have suffer april', 'gl would remain unfit', 'gl would remain future']"
The Pratteln municipal social security services stated in a letter of 11 June 1991 that Mr Gül would have to have several operations and that for the time being he was waiting to be awarded an invalidity pension.,non-argumentative,"['service state letter', 'gl would have ', ' to have operation', 'he be wait ', ' to be award pension']"
"For the first three months of this year alone the social security services have paid the Gül family CHF 8,731.75, and the family will remain dependent on social security payments.",non-argumentative,"['service have pay 8,731.75', 'family will remain ']"
In June 1991 Mr Gül stated during a personal interview with the subordinate authority (Vorinstanz) that his family was at that time entirely dependent on social security payments.,non-argumentative,['gl state interview']
He therefore has no other source of income.,non-argumentative,['he have source']
"At present the social security services are paying the Gül family the amount needed by a three-person family, but no more.",non-argumentative,"['service be pay amount', ' need family']"
The social security services cannot be expected to provide for children arriving from abroad when it is known in advance that they will have to support them.,non-argumentative,"['service can be not expect ', ' to provide child', 'it be know advance', 'they will have ', ' to support they']"
Nor can Mr Gül support his other children from his own resources. For that reason alone the application for family reunion must be refused.,non-argumentative,"['gl can support child', 'gl can support resource', 'application must be refuse ']"
Article 39 para. 1 (d) also requires firm arrangements to be made for the care of children.,non-argumentative,['arrangement to be make ']
"But Mrs Gül, for reasons connected with her illness, is not mentally or physically capable of keeping her daughter Nursal with her and looking after her.",non-argumentative,"['company necte ', ' keep daughter', ' keep she', ' look she']"
"That is why Nursal has been brought up in the ""Auf Berg"" children’s home in Seltisberg, where she is to remain.",non-argumentative,['nursal have be bring home']
"It follows that if Mr and Mrs Gül’s eight-year-old son Ersin joined the family, it is not at all certain that firm arrangements could be made for his care.",non-argumentative,"['it follow ', 'son join family', ' be make care']"
"He too would presumably have to be brought up in a children’s home, which is not the aim of family reunion.",non-argumentative,"['he would have ', ' to be bring children', ' to be bring home']"
A medical certificate dated 18 April 1991 states that Mrs Gül is suffering from a serious illness which makes it necessary for her to have constant medical supervision and treatment.,non-argumentative,"['certificate state ', 'gl be suffer illness', 'which make ', 'she to have supervision']"
The cantonal government went on to say that residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds under Article 13 (f) of the OLNA could not in addition confer on the recipients a right to family reunion.,non-argumentative,"['government go ', ' to say permit', ' issue ground', ' issue f']"
"In order to ensure equal treatment for all aliens not having the right to reside in Switzerland, such reunion could take place only under Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA.",non-argumentative,"[' to ensure treatment', ' have right', ' to reside switzerland', 'ld take place', 'ld take article', 'ld take .']"
"Lastly, the cantonal government considered the situation of the younger boy from the standpoint of Article 36 of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below), announcing its decision in the following terms:",non-argumentative,"['company sidere situation', 'company sidere standpoint', ' see paragraph', ' announce decision', ' announce term']"
Ersin Gül is only eight.,non-argumentative,[]
"It must be determined whether his entry into Switzerland would be in accordance with Article 36 of the OLNA, which requires an `important reason’ that is lacking in this case.",non-argumentative,"['it must be determine ', 'which require reason', 'that be lack case']"
There is no special reason for treating Ersin Gül differently from other children wishing to rejoin their families in respect of whom the conditions laid down in Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA have not been satisfied.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', ' treat gl', ' to rejoin family', 'dition lay seq', 'dition lay .']"
Another reason for refusing to admit him to Switzerland is the fact that Ersin and Tuncay Gül would be separated.,non-argumentative,"[' to admit he', ' to admit switzerland', 'ersin would be separate ']"
Ersin has lived with Tuncay since birth.,non-argumentative,"['ersin have live tuncay', 'ersin have live birth']"
"On the other hand, he has been separated from his father and mother for eight years and three and a half years respectively.",non-argumentative,"['he have be separate father', 'he have be separate year']"
"Having regard to the child’s welfare, which plays an important role in family reunion cases, the question arises, at the very least, whether it is reasonable to separate him from his brother and the environment he is used to in order to bring him to live with his mother, who is seriously ill and unable to keep him with her or look after him, and his father, who went away to Switzerland three month’s after Ersin’s birth, which means that he hardly knows him.",non-argumentative,"[' have regard', 'which play role', 'which play case', 'question arise least', ' to separate he', ' to separate brother', ' to separate order', 'he be use ', ' to bring he', ' to live mother', ' to keep he', ' to keep she', ' look he', 'who go birth', 'which mean ', 'he know he']"
"In view of all the circumstances, and having regard to the child’s welfare, the cantonal government considers that Ersin Gül should not be authorised to join his parents in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"[' have regard', 'company sider ', 'gl should number be authorise ', ' to join parent', ' to join switzerland']"
"In any case, there is no important reason within the meaning of Article 36 of the OLNA which requires him to be admitted to Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'which require he', ' to be admit switzerland']"
The cantonal government concluded that Mr Gül had not satisfied the conditions laid down for family reunion and that his children could not rely on Article 13 (f) or Article 36 of the OLNA either in order to come to Switzerland to join him.,non-argumentative,"['company clude ', 'gl have ', 'number satisfy dition', ' lay reunion', 'number rely f', 'number rely e', ' to join he']"
On 2 September 1991 the applicant lodged an administrative-law appeal with the Swiss Federal Court.,non-argumentative,"['applicant lodge appeal', 'applicant lodge court']"
"He repeated his previous arguments (see paragraph 15 above) and added that, because of the ""special circumstances"", Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention gave his sons the right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['he repeat argument', ' see paragraph', 'he add ', '8) give right', ' to obtain permission', ' to reside switzerland']"
"The earlier issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds to himself, his wife and his daughter had been based on the finding that a return to Turkey was impossible, as it would put the health of his wife and daughter seriously at risk.",non-argumentative,"['issue have be base finding', 'it would put health', 'it would put risk']"
"Mr Gül argued that the same considerations which had prevailed in the decision to grant that residence permit should prevent any withdrawal thereof, which would be tantamount to subjecting Mrs Gül, whose state of health was still causing concern, to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",non-argumentative,"['gl argue ', 'which have prevail decision', ' to grant permit', 'sideration should prevent withdrawal', ' subject gl', ' subject treatment', 'state be cause cern']"
"The residence permit issued to Mr and Mrs Gül on humanitarian grounds was therefore the equivalent of a settlement permit, and it followed that they had the right to family reunion, which could only take place in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"[' issue ground', 'it follow ', 'they have right', 'which ld take place', 'which ld take switzerland', 'company ld take place', 'company ld take switzerland']"
In a judgment of 2 July 1993 the Federal Court declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible.,non-argumentative,['court declare ']
"It pointed out that, pursuant to section 100 (b) (3) of the Federal Administration of Justice Act, an administrative-law appeal in an immigration-control case was inadmissible if it concerned the issue or refusal of permits to which federal legislation conferred no entitlement.",non-argumentative,"['it point ', 'company cerne issue', 'company ferre number', 'company ferre entitlement']"
"Like the cantonal government, the Federal Court found that neither section 17 (2) of the RSAA nor Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention conferred such a right on an alien resident outside Switzerland whose parent living in Switzerland had only a residence permit, as Mr Gül did.",non-argumentative,"['court find art', ' ferre right', ' ferre resident', ' live switzerland', 'parent have permit', 'gl do ']"
"In particular, Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention could be relied on only by a person who had the right of abode in Switzerland either by virtue of his Swiss nationality or by virtue of a settlement permit.",non-argumentative,"[' be rely person', 'who have right', 'who have virtue']"
The court gave this ruling in the following terms:,non-argumentative,"['company give ruling', 'company give term']"
Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for family life.,non-argumentative,"['8) guarantee right', ' to respect life']"
"In certain circumstances the right to be issued with a residence permit can be deduced from this (see ATF [Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 118 Ib 152 at 4, 157 at c; 116 Ib 355 at 1b; 109 Ib 185 at 2), so that Article 8 (art. 8) may be breached where an alien whose family lives in Switzerland is refused leave to enter the country.",non-argumentative,"[' to be issue permit', 'right can be deduce this', ' see judgments', '8) may be breach ', 'family live switzerland', 'alien be refuse leave', ' to enter ntry']"
"According to the Federal Court’s established case-law, however, a breach can occur only where the family members living in Switzerland themselves possess a well-established right of abode (Anwesenheitsrecht).",non-argumentative,"[' accord law', 'breach can occur ', ' live switzerland', 'member possess right']"
"For that purpose, it is in principle necessary to have Swiss nationality or possess a settlement permit (see ATF 116 Ib 355 at 1b; 115 Ib 4 at 1d).",non-argumentative,"[' to have nationality', ' possess permit', ' see atf']"
"A mere residence permit is at any rate not sufficient unless it is based on a firmly established right (see ATF 111 Ib 163/4 at 1a), as the Federal Court has held in many unpublished judgments (most recently in the judgment of 6 April 1993 in the case of K., at 1b) ...",non-argumentative,"['it be base right', ' see atf', 'court have hold judgment', 'court have hold judgment']"
"That is, moreover, consistent with the new provisions on the legal status of aliens having family members in Switzerland (sections 7 and 17 (2) of the RSAA, as amended on 23 March 1990, which came into force on 1 January 1992).",non-argumentative,"[' have member', ' amend march', 'which come force', 'which come january']"
"Under the Act the right to family reunion presupposes a firmly established right of abode, as pointed out above (at 1b).",non-argumentative,"['right presuppose right', ' point 1b', ' point )']"
"Given that the legislature’s intention in adopting the amendment in question was precisely to take account of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights (see Bbl [Federal Gazette] 1987 III, pp. 293 et seq., particularly pp. 321 and 322), there is no reason, when that provision (art. 8) of the Convention is invoked with regard to recognition of legal rights in the matter of residence permits, to go beyond what the Act itself expressly provides (see the Federal Court’s unpublished judgment of 6 April 1993 in the case of K., at 1b).",non-argumentative,"[' adopt amendment', ' to take account', ' to take art', ' see gazette', 'there be reason', 'provision art ', '8) be invoke regard', 'act provide ', '8) see judgment']"
"The Federal Court also emphasised the differences between settlement permits and residence permits, stating:",non-argumentative,['court emphasise difference']
"Unlike settlement permits, which are issued for an indefinite period (section 6 (1) of the Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act - hereinafter the RSAA), residence permits are always subject to a time-limit (section 5 (1) of the RSAA).",non-argumentative,"['which be issue period', 'which be issue section']"
"Whatever the reason for granting the first residence permit, an alien must therefore allow for the possibility that his permit will not be renewed.",non-argumentative,"[' grant permit', 'alien must allow possibility', 'permit will be renew ']"
"There could be many reasons for this, including, for example, police, economic or demographic considerations.",non-argumentative,"[' include police', ' include example']"
"Although the alien’s personal circumstances have to be taken into account in the inquiry into the proportionality of the decision not to renew, that does not mean that the alien is on that account entitled to have his residence permit renewed.",non-argumentative,"['circumstance have ', ' to be take account', ' to be take inquiry', 'that do mean ', 'alien be entitle ', 'permit renew ']"
The above statement of the law also applies to residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds.,non-argumentative,"['statement apply permit', ' issue ground']"
"In addition, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the particular circumstances which justified the issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds will subsequently cease to exist, or lose their significance to such an extent that not only will there no longer be any reason to exclude the person concerned from the quotas, but even renewal of the residence permit will no longer be justified.",non-argumentative,"['possibility can be not rule ', 'which justify issue', 'circumstance will cease ', 'circumstance lose significance', 'circumstance lose extent', ' to exclude person', ' to exclude quota', 'renewal be justify ']"
"Moreover, it is apparent from the rule established in Article 12 para. 2 of the OLNA that the conditions required for a finding that the case is an extremely serious one may subsequently cease to exist (see the unpublished judgment of 3 July 1992 in the case of P., at 6).",non-argumentative,"[' establish para', 'company dition ', ' require finding', '2 may cease ', ' see judgment']"
The question whether the case is of this type is therefore entirely separate from the question whether the person concerned has the right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland by virtue of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights (see ATF 115 Ib 8).,non-argumentative,"[' to obtain permission', ' to obtain virtue', ' to reside switzerland', ' see ib']"
"Furthermore, in the instant case the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out that in the future the medical or other reasons which led the authorities to grant the residence permit will lose their significance, or that new grounds justifying a refusal to renew the permit will become apparent.",non-argumentative,"['possibility can be not rule ', 'which lead authority', ' to grant permit', 'reason will lose significance', ' justify refusal', ' to renew permit', 'ground will become ']"
The appellant can therefore not deduce from the fact that he is authorised to reside in Switzerland any right to the issue of a residence permit for his sons.,non-argumentative,"['appellant can number deduce right', 'appellant can number deduce fact', 'he be authorise ', ' to reside switzerland']"
"The Federal Court went on to say that the question how the OLNA should be applied to the issue of permits was not one it had to examine in connection with the administrative-law appeal, as the cantonal government had already looked into the question whether the Güls’ younger son could be issued with a residence permit under Article 36 of the OLNA.",non-argumentative,"['court go ', 'olna should be apply issue', 'it have ', ' to examine nection', ' to examine appeal', 'government have look question', 'company be issue permit', 'company be issue article']"

Owing to his grandfather’s limited financial resources and the distance between the homes of some of these families and the school it was not possible for the boy to attend school on a regular basis.,non-argumentative,"[' owe resource', 'boy to attend school', 'boy to attend basis']"

"Mr Gül submitted that the result in practice of the authorities’ persistent refusal to allow Ersin to join him in Switzerland had been to separate the family and make it impossible, owing to lack of sufficient financial resources, for the parents to maintain regular contacts with their son, whereas, according to the Court’s case-law, contacts between parents and child were of capital importance.",non-argumentative,"['gl submit ', 'ersin to join he', 'ersin to join switzerland', ' to separate family', ' owe lack', 'parent to maintain tact', 'parent to maintain son', ' accord law']"

"Lastly, the Swiss authorities were not under any obligation to ensure that the applicant led an optimal family life in Switzerland.",non-argumentative,"['applicant lead life', 'applicant lead switzerland']"

What is at stake in this case is whether the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland with his parents violated Switzerland’s obligation under Article 8 (art. 8) to respect the applicant’s family life.,non-argumentative,"[' to grant authorisation', ' to reside switzerland', ' to reside parent', 'refusal violate obligation', ' to respect life']"

One more preliminary remark with regard to the facts.,non-argumentative,[]
"The Court has repeatedly stressed that it is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it (see, inter alia, the Cruz Varas and Others v.

"The Government have contended - without basing their contention on specific facts - that in 1983 the applicant left Turkey ""of his own free will, preferring to seek employment in Switzerland"" thereby suggesting that the applicant’s assertion that he came to Switzerland as a refugee was a falsehood.",non-argumentative,"['government have tend ', ' base tention', ' base fact', 'applicant leave turkey', 'applicant leave will', ' to seek employment', 'he come switzerland', 'he come refugee']"
"However, although the applicant sought asylum on 26 April 1983, his application was only dismissed on 9 February 1989 together with that of his wife (which dated from 8 February 1988).",non-argumentative,"['applicant seek asylum', 'applicant seek april', 'application be dismiss february', 'application be dismiss that', 'which date february']"
The applicant appealed.,non-argumentative,['applicant appeal ']
"This appeal was never decided because the applicant withdrew his application, since - as his counsel put it without being contradicted - pursuing the application for asylum was incompatible with accepting the residence permit on humanitarian grounds that had been offered to him and his wife.",non-argumentative,"['appeal be never decide ', 'applicant withdraw application', 'nsel put it', ' pursue application', ' accept permit', ' accept ground', 'that have be offer ']"
"Under these circumstances it is not for us to simply base ourselves on the refusal at first instance or to speculate, thirteen years hence, on the truth and relevance of the assertions underlying the applicant’s asylum request.",non-argumentative,"['we to base ourselves', 'we to base refusal', 'we to speculate truth', ' underlie request']"
"True, it is common ground that in the summer of 1995 the applicant visited Ersin in Turkey and, although attracting notice by a press interview, has apparently not experienced any disagreeableness from the Turkish authorities.",non-argumentative,"['applicant visit ersin', ' attract ice', ' attract interview', 'applicant have experience disagreeableness']"

"In its Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, the Court adopted the established doctrine of the Commission that although, certainly, the right of aliens to enter or to remain in a country is not as such guaranteed by the Convention, immigration controls have to be exercised consistently with Convention obligations and that, accordingly, the exclusion of a person from a State where members of his family are living may raise an issue under Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 59 and 60 of the judgment).",non-argumentative,"['court adopt doctrine', ' to remain ntry', ' guarantee convention', 'trol have ', ' to be exercise obligation', 'member be live ', 'exclusion may raise issue', 'exclusion may raise art', ' see paragraph']"
"Since this judgment there has been a considerable evolution in the Court’s general doctrine on Article 8 (art. 8), but not on this point.",non-argumentative,[' number point']
"On the contrary, its subsequent case-law has solidly confirmed the principle that, although Contracting States have, as a matter of well-established international law, the right to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens, that right is subject to their obligations under the Convention, notably those under Article 8 (art. 8) (see the Berrehab v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 138, pp. 15-16, paras. 28-29; the Moustaquim v.

In this context it is immaterial whether the applicant left his wife and Ersin under fear from political prosecution or purely for economic reasons.,non-argumentative,"['applicant leave wife', 'applicant leave fear']"
"Before it is possible to assess whether the refusal was justified, it is - alas - necessary to give some consideration to the question whether or not Switzerland’s obligation under Article 8 (art. 8) is a positive or a negative one.",non-argumentative,"['refusal be justify ', ' to give sideration']"
The Court’s case-law distinguishes between positive and negative obligations.,non-argumentative,['law distinguish obligation']
"Negative obligations require member States to refrain from action, positive to take action.",non-argumentative,"['obligation require states', ' to refrain action', ' to take action']"
"The Court has repeatedly stressed that the boundaries between the two types ""do not lend themselves to precise definition"" (see, for instance, the Keegan v.

"The present case well illustrates the truth of this proposition since the question whether the Swiss decision violated a positive or a negative obligation, if either, seems hardly more than one of semantics: the refusal of the Swiss authorities to let Ersin and his parents be reunited may be considered as an action from which they should have refrained, whereas it could arguably also be viewed as failing to take an action which they were required to take, namely making a reunion possible by granting the authorisation.",non-argumentative,"['case illustrate truth', 'decision violate positive', 'question seem more', 'ersin be reunite ', 'refusal may be sidere action', 'they should have refrain ', 'ld be view ', ' to take action', 'they be require ', ' grant authorisation']"
"If one takes the view that, if there is a violation at all, it must be of a positive obligation - a view that finds support in the aforementioned Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment (see paragraph 4 above) - then one has to put up with the rather awkward systematic inconsistency that exclusion of a person from a state where his family lives does not fall into the same category of breaches as expulsion of a person from a state where his family lives: the former decision may be in breach of a positive obligation under Article 8 (art. 8), whereas the latter may be in breach of a negative obligation.",non-argumentative,"['one take view', 'there be violation', 'that find support', 'that find judgment', ' see paragraph', 'one have ', ' to put inconsistency', 'family live ', ' fall category', 'family live ']"
These and other difficulties in distinguishing between cases where positive and cases where negative obligations are at stake would be immaterial if both kinds of obligation were treated alike.,non-argumentative,"[' distinguish case', 'kind be treat ']"
"There was a time, however, when the Court’s case-law did treat them differently.",non-argumentative,"['there be time', 'law do treat they']"
"The Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment is a striking instance: see paragraph 67 of that judgment.",non-argumentative,[' see paragraph']
"Under the pretext of the vagueness of the notion ""respect"" in Article 8 (art. 8) the Court held that its requirements will vary from case to case, thus creating for itself the possibility of taking into account, when establishing whether or not there is a positive obligation, whether or not there is a consensus between member States and, moreover, a wide margin of appreciation for the State concerned.",non-argumentative,"['court hold ', 'requirement will vary case', ' create possibility', ' create itself', ' take account', 'there be obligation', 'there be sensus']"
This approach has been rightly criticised both outside and inside the Court.,non-argumentative,['approach have be criticise ']
"One of the main objections was that under this doctrine, in the context of positive obligations, the margin of appreciation might already come into play at the stage of determining the existence of the obligation, whilst in the context of negative obligations it only plays a role, if at all, at the stage of determining whether a breach of the obligation is justified.",non-argumentative,"['margin might company ', ' e play', ' e stage', ' determine existence', 'it play role', 'it play stage', 'breach be justify ']"
"The Court’s doctrine on this point has, however, evolved considerably since the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment.",non-argumentative,['doctrine have evolve judgment']
The aforementioned difference in treatment between positive and negative obligations has gradually dwindled away.,non-argumentative,['difference have dwindle ']
"I agree with the Commission that the requirements of ""in accordance with the law"" and ""legitimate aim"" are fulfilled.",non-argumentative,"['i agree commission', 'requirement be fulfil ']"
"The applicant’s argument that the refusal was not ""in accordance with the law"" did not convince me.",non-argumentative,[]
"On the other hand I cannot help saying that I consider the Government’s attempt to embellish the harsh, political objectives of their decision by pleading that in the first place it was designed to serve Ersin’s interests rather hypocritical.",non-argumentative,"['i can not help ', ' to embellish objective', 'it be design ', ' to serve interest']"
"The stress laid on financial considerations makes it clear that the legitimate aim pursued was, if not only then mainly, ""the interests of the economic well-being of the country"".",non-argumentative,"[' lay sideration', 'stress make ']"
It follows that in any event the decisive question is whether the refusal of authorisation to reside in Switzerland was proportionate.,non-argumentative,"['it follow ', ' to reside switzerland']"
"Was it ""necessary in a democratic society"" to refuse the applicant’s seven-year-old son Ersin authorisation to come and live in Switzerland with his parents? In other words, did that decision of the Swiss authorities strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the applicant, his wife and their son on the one hand and those of the community as a whole on the other?",non-argumentative,"[' to refuse authorisation', ' live switzerland', ' live parent', 'decision do strike balance']"
In explaining the interests of the community the Government have stressed that Switzerland has a very high percentage of foreigners living within its borders.,non-argumentative,"[' explain interest', 'government have stress ', 'switzerland have percentage', ' live border']"
"Hence, as counsel for the Government put it at our hearing, ""in Switzerland immigration is a particularly sensitive subject"".",non-argumentative,"['nsel put it', 'nsel put hearing']"
"Against this background the Government are, understandably, afraid of creating a precedent and therefore emphasise - rightly - that what is at stake is their right to control the entry of non-nationals into their territory and that, accordingly, we should leave them a wide margin of appreciation.",non-argumentative,"[' create precedent', 'government emphasise ', ' to trol entry', 'we should leave margin']"
"In this context they stress that they have only granted the applicant and his wife a temporary residence permit on humanitarian grounds, that as a consequence of that generosity they have already to bear the costs of subsistence of the applicant, his wife and their daughter Nursal and that it is therefore asking too much to expect them to do the same for Ersin.",non-argumentative,"['they stress ', 'they have grant permit', 'they have grant ground', 'they have ', ' to bear t', 'it be ask much', 'they to do same', 'they to do ersin']"
So much for the one scale of the balance.,non-argumentative,[]

"There is a dispute as to Ersin’s living conditions, but I need not go deeply into that.",non-argumentative,"['there be dispute', 'i need ', 'number go that']"
"It suffices to note that the Government have not convincingly established that those conditions were satisfactory, let alone that, at the decisive moment, it was more in the interest of Ersin to remain in Turkey than to be reunited with his father and mother.",non-argumentative,"['it suffice number', 'government have establish ', ' to remain turkey', ' to be reunite father']"
The Government do not argue that these are not weighty interests.,non-argumentative,['government do argue ']
"But they seek to diminish their relevance by contending that the applicant - on whom, they add, is the burden - has not shown that there are obstacles to re-establishing the family - father, mother and Ersin - in Turkey.",non-argumentative,"['they seek ', ' to diminish relevance', ' to diminish company', 'they add ', 'applicant have show ', 'there be obstacle', 'there be turkey', ' establish family']"
"It is clear that the Government are thus relying on paragraph 68 of the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment.",non-argumentative,['government be rely paragraph']
"However, they choose to ignore the fact that the Court, in the first sentence of that paragraph, explicitly distinguishes ""the present proceedings"" - i.e. the cases of the three wives that were before the Court - from the case of ""immigrants who already had a family which they left behind in another country until they had achieved settled status in the United Kingdom"" (= the country of settlement).",non-argumentative,"['they choose ', ' to ignore fact', 'court distinguish proceeding', 'who have family', 'they leave ntry', 'they have achieve status', 'they have achieve kingdom']"
"That is an important proviso, for it strongly suggests that in a case of ""immigrants who already had a family which they left behind"" - such as the present applicant - different norms should be applied.",non-argumentative,"['it suggest ', 'who have family', 'they leave ', 'm should be apply ']"
Which norms?,non-argumentative,['number m ']
"The Court does not answer that question, but it is natural to infer that it intended to make it clear that in respect of such cases it might possibly hold that, in the context of the issue of family reunion, the State of settlement should respect the choice of the immigrants who have achieved settled status there and, accordingly, must accept members of their family which they had left behind for settlement.",non-argumentative,"['court do answer question', 'it intend ', 'it might hold ', 'state should respect choice', 'who have achieve status', 'state must accept member', 'they have leave settlement']"
"In other words, contrary to the Government’s suggestion, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment is no authority for their allegation that Switzerland may refuse Ersin entry - although he is a member of the family which the applicant and his wife left behind - on the mere ground that if the applicant and his wife want family reunion they should go back to Turkey, there being a violation of Switzerland’s obligations under Article 8 (art. 8) only if the applicant proves that there are obstacles to doing so or other special reasons why that could not be expected of him.",non-argumentative,"['switzerland may refuse entry', 'switzerland may refuse ground', 'applicant leave ', 'applicant want reunion', 'they should go ', 'applicant prove ', 'there be obstacle', 'number be expect he']"
"On the contrary, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment supports the proposition that in cases where a father and mother have achieved settled status in a country and want to be reunited with their child which for the time being they have left behind in their country of origin, it is per se unreasonable, if not inhumane to give them the choice between giving up the position which they have acquired in the country of settlement or to renounce the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company which constitutes a fundamental element of family life.",non-argumentative,"['judgment support proposition', 'father have achieve status', 'father have achieve ntry', 'father want ', ' to be reunite child', 'they have leave ntry', ' to give choice', ' give position', ' give settlement', 'they have acquire ntry', ' to renounce enjoyment', ' stitute element']"
"It remains, of course, to be considered whether the latter principle applies in the present case, where the applicant has not ""achieved settled status"" in Switzerland, in so far as he and his wife have not been granted a ""settlement permit"", but have to base their right of residence on a permit which has, in principle, a temporary character and, consequently, a lower legal status than a settlement permit.",non-argumentative,"['it remain rse', 'principle apply case', 'applicant have achieve status', 'applicant have achieve switzerland', 'he have be grant permit', 'he have ', ' to base right', ' to base permit', 'which have character', 'which have principle']"

"However, the European Court of Human Rights has to ensure, in particular, that State interests do not crush those of an individual, especially in situations where political pressure - such as the growing dislike of immigrants in most member States - may inspire State authorities to harsh decisions.",non-argumentative,"['court have ', 'interest do crush those', 'interest do crush situation', 'pressure may inspire authority', 'pressure may inspire decision']"
"As we stressed in paragraph 29 of our aforementioned Berrehab judgment (see paragraph 4 above), the Court must examine cases like this not only from the point of view of immigration and residence, but also with regard to the mutual interests of the applicant, his wife and Ersin.",non-argumentative,"['we stress paragraph', ' see paragraph', 'court must examine case', 'court must examine point']"
