"In respect of the sentencing regime, the Government submit that the question of whether the accused is tried by the civilian or military authorities is a decision for the civilian authorities, though by agreement the military authorities do not have to report certain matters to the civilian authorities.",premise,"['government submit ', 'accuse be try authority', 'authority do have ', ' to report matter', ' to report authority']"
A wider sentencing regime is not possible due to the lack of facilities in the armed forces and to the fact that some sentences would be inappropriate to pass upon a serving member of the armed forces and inconsistent with his duties.,premise,[' to pass member']
"The Government further submit that the decision of the court-martial was reasonable in view of, inter alia, the importance of discipline in army life, the context in which the offences were committed and the seriousness of the charges.",premise,"['government submit ', 'offence be mitte ']"
