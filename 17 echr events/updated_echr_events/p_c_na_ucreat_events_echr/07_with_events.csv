"It should have scrutinised the lower courts' judgments in the light of Article 10 (art. 10), that is: should have critically examined whether their findings of fact and their reasoning were sufficiently solid to justify convincingly the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression.",premise,"['it should have scrutinise judgment', 'it should have scrutinise light', ' to justify interference']"

I have not been satisfied that this question may be answered in the affirmative.,non-argumentative,['question may be answer affirmative']
"The picture which arises both from some of the statements of the witnesses for the prosecution and from the comments in the Government's memorial - which, incidentally, go much further than those statements - is one of a long-standing tension between majority and minority, a tension for which presumably both sides, but certainly also the Greek authorities bear responsibility.",non-argumentative,"['which arise some', 'which go ', 'side bear responsibility']"
"It has not even been made plausible, let alone convincingly established that this tension exclusively or mainly resulted from the mere use of the impugned designation",non-argumentative,"['it have be make plausible', 'it establish ', 'tension result use']"
"Against this background the decisive question is whether the Government have convincingly established, firstly, that the mere fact that the leader of a minority, in a political pamphlet which was evidently exclusively meant for that minority, repeatedly designated that minority as ""Turkish"" was indeed provocative of discord between majority and minority and of acts of violence between the two groups, and, secondly, that this use of the impugned designation was attributable to seditious intention.",non-argumentative,"['government have establish ', 'which be mean minority', 'leader designate minority']"
There is all the more reason for extreme vigilance because the criticism concerned the Government's attitude towards the minority in question and more especially their policy of denying that the minority is not only a religious but also an ethnic one.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'company cerne attitude']"
In such cases there is no room for relying on the judgments of the national courts nor for a margin of appreciation.,non-argumentative,"['there be room', ' rely judgment', ' rely margin']"
"When criminal provisions purporting to prevent disturbance of public peace are relied on against a politician who is not only an opponent and a critic of the Government but also a member of a minority, the European Court of Human Rights should apply its highest standards of scrutiny in order to ascertain whether these provisions have been abused, as they easily may be and often are.",non-argumentative,"[' to prevent disturbance', 'provision be rely politician', 'court should apply standard', 'provision have be abuse ']"

The Greek courts held that the applicant had deliberately used such speech in a pamphlet of October 1989 and therefore convicted him .,non-argumentative,"['company hold ', 'applicant have use speech', 'applicant have use pamphlet', 'company victe he']"
"It is of importance to note that this conviction was exclusively based on the applicant's repeatedly referring to the Muslim minority in Western Thrace as ""Turkish"": the remainder of the contents of the pamphlet was not taken into consideration.",non-argumentative,"['viction be base ', 'applicant refer minority', 'applicant refer turkish', 'remainder be take sideration']"
"Thus, what is in issue is only whether, in the relevant circumstances of the case, the mere fact of repeatedly referring to the Muslim minority as ""Turkish"" justified the applicant's conviction and sentence.",non-argumentative,"[' refer minority', ' refer turkish', 'fact justify viction']"
It is a significant feature of the present case that the impugned terminology was used in the context of a political debate by a politician campaigning for election.,non-argumentative,"['terminology be use text', ' campaign election']"
"Moreover, and above all, it was used by a politician belonging to a specific minority who sought to win votes by stressing his leadership of that minority and by proclaiming his conviction that this minority was to be characterised not only by its religion but also by its ethnic origin, that is by its being Turkish.",non-argumentative,"['it be use politician', ' belong minority', 'who seek ', ' to win vote', ' stress leadership', ' proclaim viction', ' to be characterise religion']"
"It is obvious that the applicant's conviction and sentence constituted an interference with his rights under Article 10 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 10-1) and that this interference was justified under paragraph 2 (art. 10 2) to the extent that it met the requirement implied in the words ""prescribed by law"" as well as that of serving a legitimate aim within the meaning of this paragraph (art. 10-2).",non-argumentative,"['company stitute interference', 'interference be justify art', 'it meet requirement', ' imply word', ' prescribe law', ' serve aim', ' serve meaning']"

The Greek Government's exception therefore fails.,non-argumentative,['exception fail ']

"It follows from the above that in assessing whether these grievances justified quashing the Court of Appeal's judgment the Supreme Court should not have restricted itself to merely examining the arguments, mainly based on domestic law and practice, put forward by the applicant's lawyer in support of those grievances, but should have examined moreover whether these grievances might justify quashing when based on the argument that taking into account the applicant's rights under Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) the prosecution case should have been dismissed or the Patras Court of Appeal should have given better reasons for its decision.",non-argumentative,"['it follow above', 'grievance justify ', ' quash judgment', 'court should have restrict itself', ' examine argument', ' base law', ' put lawyer', ' put support', 'court should have examine ', 'grievance might justify ', ' base argument', ' take account', 'case should have be dismiss ', 'court should have give reason']"

"In my opinion the distribution of proof is such that it is for the applicant to satisfy the Court that, in principle, the domestic courts were in a position to apply the Convention ex officio, whilst -once this burden of proof has been discharged - it is incumbent on the Government which nevertheless maintain their objection to establish that, due to the special circumstances obtaining in the concrete case, the domestic courts were not in a position to base their judgment on such ex officio application of the Convention.",non-argumentative,"['applicant to satisfy court', ' to apply convention', 'burden have be discharge ', 'which maintain objection', ' obtain case', ' to base judgment', ' to base application']"

This salutary evolution has greatly enhanced the protection of human rights in Europe.,non-argumentative,['evolution have enhance protection']
Against this background I find it open to doubt whether the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies still quite fits into the system because the rule thwarts the Court's power to do justice in those cases of violation of human rights where the victim has not enjoyed proper legal assistance in the domestic sphere.,non-argumentative,"['i find ', 'rule fit system', 'rule thwart power', 'victim have enjoy assistance', 'victim have enjoy sphere']"
