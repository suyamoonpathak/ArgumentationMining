"Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court’s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas.",premise,"[' bear obligation', ' bear mind', ' to take measure', ' to eliminate form', ' to prevent doctrine', ' see paragraph', 'company sidere whole', 'item appear point', ' to have have propagation', ' to have have purpose']"

The Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above).,premise,"['court hold ', ' to justify dissemination', ' see paragraph']"

"The applicant maintained that his conviction and sentence for having aided and abetted the dissemination of racist remarks violated his right to freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which reads:",non-argumentative,"['applicant maintain ', ' abet dissemination', 'viction violate right', 'which read ']"
Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.,non-argumentative,['everyone have right']
This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.,non-argumentative,"['right shall include freedom', ' to hold opinion', ' impart information', ' impart interference']"
"This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.",non-argumentative,"['article shall prevent state', ' require licensing']"
"The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.",non-argumentative,"['it carry duty', 'it carry it', ' be prescribe law', ' prevent disclosure', ' receive fidence', ' maintain authority']"
The Government contested this contention whereas the Commission upheld it.,non-argumentative,"['company test company', 'commission uphold it']"
It is common ground that the measures giving rise to the applicant’s case constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression.,non-argumentative,"[' give rise', 'measure stitute interference']"
"The only point in dispute is whether the measures were ""necessary in a democratic society"".",non-argumentative,[]
"The applicant and the Commission were of the view that, notwithstanding Denmark’s obligations as a Party to the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above), a fair balance had to be struck between the ""protection of the reputation or rights of others"" and the applicant’s right to impart information.",non-argumentative,"[' withstand obligation', ' see paragraph', ' to be strike protection', ' to impart information']"
"This undermined the Government’s argument that his conviction was required by the UN Convention and ""necessary"" within the meaning of Article 10 (art. 10).",non-argumentative,"['this undermine argument', 'viction be require convention']"
The Government moreover disputed that the matter would have been dealt with differently had the 1991 Media Liability Act been in force at the material time.,non-argumentative,"['government dispute ', 'matter would have be deal ']"
The rule that only the author of a punishable statement may incur liability was subject to exceptions (see paragraph 20 above); how the applicant’s case would have been considered under the 1991 Act was purely a matter of speculation,non-argumentative,"['author may incur liability', ' see paragraph', 'case would have be sidere act']"
"The Government stressed that at all three levels the Danish courts, which were in principle better placed than the European Court to evaluate the effects of the programme, had carried out a careful balancing exercise of all the interests involved.",non-argumentative,"['government stress ', 'rt place court', 'be place court', ' to evaluate effect', 'at have carry exercise']"
The review effected by those courts had been similar to that carried out under Article 10 (art. 10); their decisions fell within the margin of appreciation to be left to the national authorities and corresponded to a pressing social need.,non-argumentative,"[' effect rt', ' carry art', 'decision fall margin', ' to be leave authority', 'company respond need']"
The Court would emphasise at the outset that it is particularly conscious of the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations.,non-argumentative,"['court would emphasise outset', 'company bate discrimination']"
"In the second place, Denmark’s obligations under Article 10 (art. 10) must be interpreted, to the extent possible, so as to be reconcilable with its obligations under the UN Convention.",non-argumentative,[' must be interpret extent']
"In this respect it is not for the Court to interpret the ""due regard"" clause in Article 4 of the UN Convention, which is open to various constructions.",non-argumentative,['court to interpret clause']
The Court is however of the opinion that its interpretation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention in the present case is compatible with Denmark’s obligations under the UN Convention.,non-argumentative,[]
A significant feature of the present case is that the applicant did not make the objectionable statements himself but assisted in their dissemination in his capacity of television journalist responsible for a news programme of Danmarks Radio (see paragraphs 9 to 11 above).,non-argumentative,"['applicant do make statement', 'applicant assist dissemination', 'applicant assist capacity', ' see paragraph']"
"In assessing whether his conviction and sentence were ""necessary"", the Court will therefore have regard to the principles established in its case-law relating to the role of the press (as summarised in for instance the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",non-argumentative,"['court will have regard', ' establish law', ' relate role', ' summarise judgment']"
"Although formulated primarily with regard to the print media, these principles doubtless apply also to the audiovisual media.",non-argumentative,"[' formulate regard', 'principle apply medium']"
"In considering the ""duties and responsibilities"" of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor and it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, Commission’s admissibility decision of 16 April 1991, application no. 15404/89, Decisions and Reports (DR) 70, p. 262).",non-argumentative,"['it be acknowledge ', 'medium have effect', 'medium see purcell']"
The audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart.,non-argumentative,"['medium have mean', 'company veye meaning']"
"At the same time, the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question.",non-argumentative,"['method may vary ', ' depend thing']"
"It is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists.",non-argumentative,"[' to substitute view', ' to substitute those', 'technique should be adopt journalist']"
"The Court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",non-argumentative,"['court will look interference', 'court will look light', 'company plain ', 'court determine ', ' adduce authority', ' to justify it', ' see judgment']"
"In doing so the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for instance, the Schwabe v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, pp. 32-33, para. 29).",non-argumentative,"['court have ', ' to satisfy itself', 'authority do apply standard', ' embody art', 'they base themselves', 'they base assessment', ' see judgment', ' see instance']"
"The Court’s assessment will have regard to the manner in which the Greenjackets feature was prepared, its contents, the context in which it was broadcast and the purpose of the programme.",non-argumentative,"['assessment will have regard', 'feature be prepare ', 'it be broadcast ']"
"News reporting based on interviews, whether edited or not, constitutes one of the most important means whereby the press is able to play its vital role of ""public watchdog"" (see, for instance, the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59).",non-argumentative,"[' base interview', 'reporting stitute one', 'reporting stitute pp', ' to play role', ' see judgment', ' see instance']"
The punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so.,non-argumentative,"[' assist dissemination', ' make person', ' make interview', 'punishment would hamper tribution', 'punishment should be envisage ', 'there be reason']"
In this regard the Court does not accept the Government’s argument that the limited nature of the fine is relevant; what matters is that the journalist was convicted.,non-argumentative,"['court do accept argument', 'what matter ', 'journalist be victe ']"
"There can be no doubt that the remarks in respect of which the Greenjackets were convicted (see paragraph 14 above) were more than insulting to members of the targeted groups and did not enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) (see, for instance, the Commission’s admissibility decisions in Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands, applications nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, DR 18, p. 187; and Künen v. Germany, application no. 12194/86, DR 56, p. 205).",non-argumentative,"['greenjackets be victe ', ' see paragraph', ' insult member', 'number do enjoy protection', ' see decision', ' see instance']"
"However, even having regard to the manner in which the applicant prepared the Greenjackets item (see paragraph 32 above), it has not been shown that, considered as a whole, the feature was such as to justify also his conviction of, and punishment for, a criminal offence under the Penal Code.",non-argumentative,"[' have regard', 'applicant prepare item', ' see paragraph', 'it have be show ', 'number have be show ', ' sidere whole', ' to justify viction']"
"Having regard to the foregoing, the reasons adduced in support of the applicant’s conviction and sentence were not sufficient to establish convincingly that the interference thereby occasioned with the enjoyment of his right to freedom of expression was ""necessary in a democratic society""; in particular the means employed were disproportionate to the aim of protecting ""the reputation or rights of others"".",non-argumentative,"[' have regard', ' adduce support', ' occasion enjoyment', ' protect reputation']"
Accordingly the measures gave rise to a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.,non-argumentative,"['measure give rise', 'measure give breach']"
"Mr Jersild sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, according to which:",non-argumentative,"['jersild seek satisfaction', 'jersild seek art', ' accord which']"
"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.""",non-argumentative,"['court find ', ' take authority', ' arise convention', 'law allow ', 'reparation to be make ', 'decision shall afford satisfaction']"

"The Court observes that the applicant still works with the Sunday News Magazine at Danmarks Radio and that his employer has supported him throughout the proceedings, inter alia by paying the fine (see paragraphs 9 and 40 above) and legal fees (see paragraph 44 below).",non-argumentative,"['court observe ', 'applicant work magazine', 'employer have support he', 'employer have support proceeding', ' pay fine', ' see paragraph', 'fee see paragraph']"
It agrees with the Government that the finding of a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) constitutes in itself adequate just satisfaction in this respect.,non-argumentative,['it agree government']
The applicant claimed in respect of costs and expenses:,non-argumentative,['applicant claim respect']
"45,000 kroner for work done in the domestic proceedings by his lawyer, Mr J. Stockholm;",non-argumentative,"[' do proceeding', ' do lawyer']"

"Holds by seventeen votes to two that Denmark is to pay the applicant, within three months, 1,000 (one thousand) Danish kroner in compensation for pecuniary damage; and, for costs and expenses, the sums resulting from the calculations to be made in accordance with paragraph 45 of the judgment;",non-argumentative,"[' hold vote', ' to pay kroner', ' to pay month', ' result calculation', ' to be make accordance']"

"This is the first time that the Court has been concerned with a case of dissemination of racist remarks which deny to a large group of persons the quality of ""human beings"".",non-argumentative,"['court have be cerne ', 'which deny quality', 'which deny group']"
"In earlier decisions the Court has - in our view, rightly - underlined the great importance of the freedom of the press and the media in general for a democratic society, but it has never had to consider a situation in which ""the reputation or rights of others"" (Article 10 para. 2) (art. 10-2) were endangered to such an extent as here.",non-argumentative,"['court have underline importance', 'it have never have sider', 'it have never have situation', '10 be endanger extent']"
"We agree with the majority (paragraph 35 of the judgment) that the Greenjackets themselves ""did not enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10)"".",non-argumentative,"['we agree paragraph', 'greenjackets do enjoy protection']"
The same must be true of journalists who disseminate such remarks with supporting comments or with their approval.,non-argumentative,"['who disseminate remark', 'who disseminate ment']"
This can clearly not be said of the applicant.,non-argumentative,['this can be say applicant']
Therefore it is admittedly difficult to strike the right balance between the freedom of the press and the protection of others.,non-argumentative,[' to strike balance']
But the majority attributes much more weight to the freedom of the journalist than to the protection of those who have to suffer from racist hatred.,non-argumentative,"['majority attribute weight', 'majority attribute freedom', 'who have ', ' to suffer hatred']"
Neither the written text of the interview (paragraph 11 of the judgment) nor the video film we have seen makes it clear that the remarks of the Greenjackets are intolerable in a society based on respect for human rights.,non-argumentative,"['we have see ', 'text make ', ' base respect']"
"The applicant has cut the entire interview down to a few minutes, probably with the consequence or even the intention of retaining the most crude remarks.",non-argumentative,"['applicant have cut interview', 'applicant have cut minute', 'applicant have cut sequence', ' retain remark']"
"That being so, it was absolutely necessary to add at least a clear statement of disapproval.",non-argumentative,[' to add statement']
"The majority of the Court sees such disapproval in the context of the interview, but this is an interpretation of cryptic remarks.",non-argumentative,"['majority see disapproval', 'majority see text']"
Nobody can exclude that certain parts of the public found in the television spot support for their racist prejudices.,non-argumentative,"['nobody can exclude ', 'part find support', 'part find spot']"
"And what must be the feelings of those whose human dignity has been attacked, or even denied, by the Greenjackets?",non-argumentative,"['dignity have be attack ', 'dignity deny greenjackets']"

We cannot share the opinion of the majority of the Court in the Jersild case.,non-argumentative,['we can not share opinion']
"There are indeed two major principles at issue in this case, one being that of freedom of expression, embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, the other the prohibition on defending racial hatred, which is obviously one of the restrictions authorised by paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and, moreover, is the subject of basic human rights documents adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, in particular the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.",non-argumentative,"['there be principle', ' embody art', ' defend hatred', ' authorise paragraph', ' adopt assembly']"
That Convention manifestly cannot be ignored when the European Convention is being implemented.,non-argumentative,"['convention can be not ignore ', 'convention be be implement ']"

"It must also guide the European Court of Human Rights in its decisions, in particular as regards the scope it confers on the terms of the European Convention and on the exceptions which the Convention lays down in general terms.",non-argumentative,"['it must guide court', 'it must guide decision', ' regard scope', 'it fer term', 'convention lay term']"
"In the Jersild case the statements made and willingly reproduced in the relevant broadcast on Danish television, without any significant reaction on the part of the commentator, did indeed amount to incitement to contempt not only of foreigners in general but more particularly of black people, described as belonging to an inferior, subhuman race (""the niggers ... are not human beings ... Just take a picture of a gorilla ... and then look at a nigger, it’s the same body structure ...",non-argumentative,"[' reproduce broadcast', 'statement do amount incitement', ' belong race', ' take picture', ' look nigger']"
"A nigger is not a human being, it’s an animal, that goes for all the other foreign workers as well, Turks, Yugoslavs and whatever they are called."").",non-argumentative,"['that go worker', 'they be call ']"
"While appreciating that some judges attach particular importance to freedom of expression, the more so as their countries have largely been deprived of it in quite recent times, we cannot accept that this freedom should extend to encouraging racial hatred, contempt for races other than the one to which we belong, and defending violence against those who belong to the races in question.",non-argumentative,"['judge attach importance', 'judge attach freedom', 'ntrie have be deprive it', 'ntrie have be deprive time', 'we can not accept ', 'freedom should extend ', ' encourage hatred', 'we belong ', ' defend violence', 'who belong race']"
It has been sought to defend the broadcast on the ground that it would provoke a healthy reaction of rejection among the viewers.,non-argumentative,"['it have be seek ', ' to defend broadcast', ' to defend ground', 'it would provoke reaction']"
"That is to display an optimism, which to say the least, is belied by experience.",non-argumentative,"[' to display optimism', ' to say least', 'which be belie experience']"
"Large numbers of young people today, and even of the population at large, finding themselves overwhelmed by the difficulties of life, unemployment and poverty, are only too willing to seek scapegoats who are held up to them without any real word of caution; for - and this is an important point - the journalist responsible for the broadcast in question made no real attempt to challenge the points of view he was presenting, which was necessary if their impact was to be counterbalanced, at least for the viewers.",non-argumentative,"['themselves overwhelm difficulty', ' to seek scapegoat', 'who be hold they', 'who be hold word', 'journalist make attempt', ' to challenge point', 'he be present ']"
"That being so, we consider that by taking criminal measures - which were, moreover, moderate ones - the Danish judicial institutions in no way infringed Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.",non-argumentative,"['we sider ', ' take measure', 'institution infringe art']"
We have voted against point 2 of the operative provisions of the judgment because we are so firmly convinced that the applicant was wrong not to react against the defence of racism that we consider it wholly unjustified to award him any compensation whatever.,non-argumentative,"['we have vote point', ' to react defence', 'we sider ', ' to award pensation']"
"As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).",non-argumentative,"[' act registrar', ' sulte agent']"
