If it appears to the court that the information was obtained legitimately this will enhance the importance of protecting the source.,non-argumentative,"['it appear company', 'it appear rt', 'information be obtain ', 'this will enhance importance', ' protect source']"

"This threat, accurately described by Lord Donaldson of Lymington M.R. [1990] 2 W.L.R. 421, 439, as 'ticking away beneath them like a time bomb' can only be defused if they can identify the source either as himself the thief of the stolen copy of the plan or as a means to lead to the identification of the thief and thus put themselves in a position to institute proceedings for the recovery of the missing document.",non-argumentative,"[' describe donaldson', ' tick they', ' tick bomb', 'they can identify source', 'they can identify himself', ' to lead identification', 'they put themselves', 'they put position', ' to institute proceeding']"

The requirements of foreseeability were not satisfied in these circumstances.,non-argumentative,[]

"The restraint was also not proportionate to the aim, since it has cast a disproportionate chilling effect on the free flow of information generally.",non-argumentative,"['it have cast effect', 'it have cast flow']"
