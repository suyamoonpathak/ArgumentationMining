"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 17 above).",premise,"['it matter respect', 'which be apply case', 'section have be enact ', 'reservation have be deposit ', 'provision clarify substance', ' lay section', ' see paragraph']"

"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).",premise,"['court point ', 'it hold ']"

"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.",premise,"['these include power', ' to quash decision', ' to quash respect', ' to quash question']"

"the Court considers that the ""declaration"" is to be regarded as a reservation within the meaning of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention",premise,"['company sider ', 'declaration be to be regard reservation']"

"The Court notes at the outset that there is no ""brief statement"" of the law which is said not to conform to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4).",premise,"['there be statement', 'which be say number']"
"Admittedly, it can be inferred from the wording of the ""declaration"" that Austria intended all proceedings that were not ""criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure"" to be excluded from the scope of Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4); the Government rightly drew attention to this.",premise,"['it can be infer wording', 'austria intend ', 'proceeding to be exclude scope', 'government draw attention', 'government draw this']"
"Nevertheless, with a description of this nature, which is not exhaustive, the ""declaration"" does not afford to a sufficient degree ""a guarantee ... that [it] does not go beyond the provisions expressly excluded"" by Austria",premise,"['declaration do afford guarantee', 'declaration do afford degree', 'it do go provision', ' exclude austria']"

That provision (P7-4) does not therefore apply before new proceedings have been opened.,premise,['proceeding have be open ']

"The former was designed to penalise acts that cause death and threaten public safety, the latter to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.",premise,"['former be design ', ' to penalise act', 'that cause death', 'that threaten safety', 'latter to ensure flow']"
the Government affirmed that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) did not preclude applying the two provisions in issue consecutively.,conclusion,"['government affirm ', 'article do preclude ', ' apply provision']"
"The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant.",premise,"['number e circumstance', ' accord court', ' refer para', '2 be make regard']"

"The Court is fully aware that the provisions in question differ not only as regards the designation of the offences but also, more importantly, as regards their nature and purpose.",premise,"['provision differ ', ' regard designation', ' regard nature']"
It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.,premise,"['it observe ', ' provide section', 'offence represent aspect', ' punish para']"
"Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct.",premise,['decision be base duct']
"Accordingly, there has been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4).",conclusion,[]
"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.",premise,"['number e ', ' follow case', 'offence fall sphere']"
This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.,premise,['this be reflect terminology']
Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).,premise,['law refer offence']
"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 16 above).",premise,"[' impose applicant', 'fine be accompany order', 'his default payment', ' see paragraph']"
