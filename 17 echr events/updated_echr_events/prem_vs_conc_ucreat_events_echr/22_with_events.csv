"They also pointed to a number of other facts capable of supporting, albeit indirectly, the reasonableness of the suspicion, including notably the findings made by the domestic courts in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, the very recent conviction of her brothers in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her own visits to the USA and her contacts with her brothers there (see especially paragraphs 10, 19, 24, 25, 28 and 29 above).",premise,"['they point number', ' support reasonableness', ' support finding', ' include finding', ' make rts', ' make proceeding', ' make offence', ' bring murray', ' necte purchase', 'visit see paragraph']"

"Any other conclusion by the Court would, they feared, prohibit arresting authorities from effecting an arrest of a person suspected of being a terrorist based primarily on reliable but secret information and would inhibit the arresting authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism.",premise,"['they fear ', 'clusion would prohibit authority', ' effect arrest', ' base information', 'clusion would inhibit authority', ' take measure', ' take nter']"

"As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention.",premise,"['explanation do meet standard', ' set para', ' judge reasonableness']"
She did not accept that the reason advanced for non-disclosure was a genuine or valid one.,premise,['she do accept ']
She in her turn pointed to circumstances said to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the suspicion.,premise,"['she point circumstance', ' to cast doubt', ' to cast reasonableness']"
"In reply to the Government the first applicant contended that the issue which the domestic courts inquired into was not the objective reasonableness of any suspicion but the subjective state of mind of the arresting officer, Corporal D. 54. For the Commission, the Government’s explanation in the present case was not materially distinguishable from that provided in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley.",premise,"['company tend ', ' provide case']"
It took the view that no objective evidence to corroborate the unrevealed information had been adduced in support of the suspicion that the first applicant had been involved in collecting money for Provisional IRA arms purchases other than her kinship with her convicted brothers.,premise,"['it take view', ' to roborate information', 'evidence have be adduce support', 'applicant have be involve money']"
"The first applicant, on the other hand, considered that the Government had failed to discharge the onus of disclosing sufficient facts to enable the Convention institutions to conclude that the suspicion grounding her arrest was reasonable or anything more than the ""honest"" suspicion required under Northern Ireland law.",conclusion,"['applicant sidere ', 'company sidere ', 'government have fail ', ' to discharge onus', ' disclose fact', ' to enable institution', ' ground arrest', ' require law']"
"With regard to the level of ""suspicion"", the Court would note firstly that, as was observed in its judgment in the case of Brogan and Others, ""sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) does not presuppose that the [investigating authorities] should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while [the arrested person is] in custody.",premise,"['court would number e', ' be observe judgment', '5 presuppose ', 'c presuppose ', 'number presuppose ', 'authority should have obtain evidence', ' to bring charge', ' to bring point']"
"Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others"" (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 53).",premise,"[' to produce rt', ' endanger life']"
The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest.,premise,"[' to further investigation', ' to further way', 'company firm ', 'company dispel suspicion', ' ground arrest']"
"Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation.",conclusion,"['which raise suspicion', ' to justify viction', 'company e stage']"

"With particular regard to the ""reasonableness"" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts.",premise,"[' state judgment', ' to be apply case', ' point judgment', 'existence depend fact']"

"(see also the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 48).",premise,[' see judgment']
"This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 (art. 5) to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts or by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (ibid., p. 23, para. 49).",premise,"['this do mean ', 'authority have blanche', 'authority have art', ' to arrest suspect', ' to arrest para', ' to arrest questioning', 'they choose ', 'terrorism be involve ']"
"As to the present case, the terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland, the carnage it has caused over the years and the active engagement of the Provisional IRA in that campaign are established beyond doubt.",premise,"['it have cause year', 'campaign be establish doubt']"
The Court also accepts that the power of arrest granted to the Army by section 14 of the 1978 Act represented a bona fide attempt by a democratically elected parliament to deal with terrorist crime under the rule of law.,premise,"['court accept ', ' grant section', 'power represent attempt', ' to deal crime', ' to deal rule']"
"That finding is not altered by the fact that the terms of the applicable legislation were amended in 1987 as a result of the Baker Report so as to include a requirement that the arrest should be based on reasonable, rather than merely honest, suspicion (see paragraph 37 above).",premise,"['finding be alter fact', 'term be amend 1987', 'term be amend result', ' to include requirement', 'arrest should be base suspicion', ' see paragraph']"
The Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.,conclusion,"['court be prepare ', ' to attach credence', ' to attach company', ' cerne existence', ' ground suspicion']"

"Nevertheless, in the words of the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, the respondent Government must in addition ""furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (see paragraph 51 above).",premise,"['government must furnish fact', ' satisfy court', 'person be suspect ', ' having mitte offence', 'government see paragraph']"
"In this connection, unlike in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Convention institutions have had the benefit of the review that the national courts conducted of the facts and of Mrs Murray’s allegations in the civil proceedings brought by her.",premise,"['institution have have benefit', 'company rt ducte', ' bring she']"
"It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was ""reasonable"" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.",premise,"['it can be not exclude ', ' adduce company', ' adduce rt', 'murray be arrest ']"
At the very least the honesty and bona fides of a suspicion constitute one indispensable element of its reasonableness.,premise,['honesty stitute element']
"In the action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts, the High Court judge, after having heard the witnesses and assessed their credibility, found that she had genuinely been suspected of having been involved in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms in the USA for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 24 above).",premise,"[' bring murray', ' bring ministry', ' bring imprisonment', ' having hear witness', ' assess credibility', 'judge find ', 'she have be suspect ', ' having be involve lection', ' see paragraph']"
"The judge believed the evidence of the arresting officer, Corporal D, who was described as a ""transparently honest witness"", as to what she had been told at her briefing before the arrest (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above).",premise,"['judge believe evidence', 'who be describe witness', 'she have be tell briefing', ' see paragraph']"
"Likewise as found by the judge, although the interview at the Army centre was later in time than the arrest, the line of questioning pursued by the interviewer also tends to support the conclusion that Mrs Murray herself was suspected of the commission of a specific criminal offence (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above).",premise,"[' find judge', ' pursue interviewer', 'line tend ', ' to support clusion', 'murray be suspect mission', ' see paragraph']"
Some weeks before her arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had been convicted in the USA of offences connected with purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).,premise,"['two have be victe usa', 'two have be victe offence', ' see paragraph']"
"As she disclosed in her evidence to the High Court, she had visited the USA and had contacts with her brothers there (see paragraph 19 above).",premise,"['she disclose evidence', 'she have visit usa', 'she have tact', ' see paragraph']"
"The offences of which her brothers were convicted were ones that implied collaboration with ""trustworthy"" persons residing in Northern Ireland.",premise,"['brother be victe ', 'that imply laboration', ' reside number', ' reside ireland']"
"Having regard to the level of factual justification required at the stage of suspicion and to the special exigencies of investigating terrorist crime, the Court finds, in the light of all the above considerations, that there did exist sufficient facts or information which would provide a plausible and objective basis for a suspicion that Mrs Murray may have committed the offence of involvement in the collection of funds for the Provisional IRA.",conclusion,"[' have regard', ' require stage', ' investigate crime', 'court find light', 'there do exist fact', 'which would provide basis', 'murray may have mitte offence']"

"On the particular facts of the present case, therefore, the Court is satisfied that, notwithstanding the lower standard of suspicion under domestic law, Mrs Murray can be said to have been arrested and detained on ""reasonable suspicion"" of the commission of a criminal offence, within the meaning of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c).",conclusion,"[' withstand standard', 'murray can be say ', ' detain suspicion']"
"She referred to the entries made in her regard on the standard record form completed at the Army centre (see paragraph 15 above), to the failure of the Army to involve the police in her questioning and to the short (one-hour) period of her questioning (see paragraph 14 above).",premise,"['she refer entry', ' make regard', ' make form', 'company plete centre', ' see paragraph', ' to involve police', ' to involve questioning', ' see paragraph']"

"However, in this context it is not normally within the province of the Court to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the domestic courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence adduced before them",premise,"[' to substitute finding', ' to substitute that', 'which be place ', ' to assess evidence', ' adduce they']"
"(see, among other authorities, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 19-20, para. 43, in relation to Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e); and the Klaas v.

In the present case no cogent elements have been produced by the first applicant in the proceedings before the Convention institutions which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact made by the Northern Ireland courts.,premise,"['element have be produce applicant', 'element have be produce proceeding', 'ld lead court', ' to depart finding', ' make rts']"
Mrs Murray was neither charged nor brought before a court but was released after an interview lasting a little longer than one hour (see paragraph 14 above).,premise,"['murray be charge ', ' bring rt', 'murray be release interview', ' see paragraph']"
"This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since ""the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement"" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53).",premise,"['this do mean ', 'existence must be sidere ', ' see judgment']"
"As the domestic courts pointed out (see paragraphs 25 in fine, 29 in fine and 34 in fine above), in view of her persistent refusal to answer any questions at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 19 above) it is not surprising that the authorities were not able to make any headway in pursuing the suspicions against her.",premise,"['company point ', ' see paragraph', ' to answer question', ' to answer centre', ' see paragraph', ' to make headway', ' pursue suspicion']"
"It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority.",conclusion,"['it can be assume ', 'suspicion have be firm ', 'charge would have be lay ', 'she would have be bring authority']"

What counts for the purpose of compliance with Convention obligations is the substance rather than the form.,premise,['company nt purpose']
"Provided that the purpose of the arrest and detention is genuinely to bring the person before the competent legal authority, the mechanics of how this is to be achieved will not be decisive.",premise,"[' to bring person', ' to bring authority']"
The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).,conclusion,"['arrest must be take ', ' to have be effect purpose', ' specify art']"

"""Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.""",premise,"['who be arrest ', 'everyone shall be inform language', 'everyone shall be inform reason', 'he understand ']"
"Although she had realised that the Army was interested in her brothers’ activities, she had not, she claimed, understood from the interview at the Army centre that she herself was suspected of involvement in fund-raising for the Provisional IRA.",premise,"['she have realise ', 'she claim ', ' have understand interview', 'she be suspect involvement']"
The only direct information she was given was the formal formula of arrest pronounced by Corporal D. 74. The Commission similarly took the view that it was impossible to draw any conclusions from what it described as the vague indications given by Corporal D. in evidence before the High Court as to whether the first applicant had been able to understand from the interview why she had been arrested.,premise,"['she be give ', ' pronounce corporal', 'commission take view', ' to draw clusion', 'it describe indication', ' give corporal', ' give evidence', ' to understand interview', 'she have be arrest ']"
The first applicant maintained that at no time during her arrest or detention had she been given any or sufficient information as to the grounds of her arrest.,conclusion,"['applicant maintain ', 'she have be give information']"
"According to the Government, on the other hand, it was apparent from the trial evidence",premise,[' accord government']
that in the interview it was made clear to Mrs Murray that she was suspected of the offence of collecting money for the Provisional IRA.,conclusion,"['it be make clear', 'she be suspect offence']"
"since she had been released rapidly, before any determination of the lawfulness of her detention could have taken place.",premise,"['she have be release ', 'determination have take place']"
"In the alternative, even if insufficient information had been given to her to avail herself of her right under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention to take legal proceedings to test the lawfulness of her detention, she had suffered no prejudice thereby which would give rise to a breach of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2)",conclusion,"['information have be give ', ' to avail herself', ' to avail right', ' to take proceeding', ' to test lawfulness', 'she have suffer prejudice', 'which would give rise', 'which would give breach']"
"It is common ground that, apart from repeating the formal words of arrest required by law, the arresting officer, Corporal D., also told Mrs Murray the section of the 1978 Act under which the arrest was being carried out (see paragraphs 12 and 36 above).",premise,"[' repeat word', ' require law', 'officer tell section', 'arrest be be carry ', ' see paragraph']"
"This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41).",premise,"[' take own', ' see judgment']"
"During the trial of Mrs Murray’s action against the Ministry of Defence, evidence as to the interview at the Army centre was given by Mrs Murray and Corporal D., but not by the soldier who had conducted the interview (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 21 above).",premise,"['evidence be give murray', 'who have ducte interview', 'number see paragraph']"
Mrs Murray testified that she had been questioned about her brothers in the USA and about her contacts with them but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence (see paragraph 19 above).,premise,"['murray testify ', 'she have be question brother', ' see paragraph']"
Corporal D. did not have a precise recollection as to the content of the questions put to Mrs Murray.,premise,"['corporal do have recollection', 'number do have recollection']"
"This is not perhaps surprising since the trial took place over three years after the events - Mrs Murray having waited eighteen months before bringing her action - and Corporal D., although present, had not taken an active part in the interview (see paragraphs 14, 16, 17 and 21 above).",premise,"['trial take place', 'trial take event', 'murray having wait ', ' bring action', 'd. have take part', 'd. have take interview', ' see paragraph']"
"Corporal D. did however remember that questions had been asked about money and about America and the trial judge found her to be a ""transparently honest witness"" (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above).",premise,"['corporal do remember ', 'question have be ask money', 'judge find ', 'corporal see paragraph']"
"Shortly before the arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had, presumably to the knowledge of all concerned in the interview, been convicted in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).",premise,"[' cerne interview', ' be victe usa', ' be victe offence', ' necte purchase', 'two see paragraph']"
They considered it established that Mrs Murray had been given sufficient information as to the grounds of her arrest.,conclusion,"['they establish ', 'it establish ', 'murray have be give information']"
"In the Court’s view, it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA.",premise,['she be be question involvement']
"Admittedly, ""there was never any probing examination of her collecting money"" - to use the words of the trial judge - but, as the national courts noted, this was because of Mrs Murray’s declining to answer any questions at all beyond giving her name (see paragraphs 14, 23, 25, 29 and 34 in fine above).",premise,"['there be examination', ' to use word', 'company rt ', 'murrays decline ', ' to answer question', ' give name', ' see paragraph']"
The Court therefore finds that the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview.,conclusion,"['court find ', 'reason be bring attention', 'reason be bring interview']"
Mrs Murray was arrested at her home at 7 a.m. and interviewed at the Army centre between 8.20 a.m. and 9.35 a.m. on the same day (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above).,premise,"['murray be arrest home', 'murray be arrest a.m.', ' interview centre', ' interview a.m.', ' see paragraph']"
In the context of the present case this interval cannot be regarded as falling outside the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness in Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).,conclusion,"['interval can be not regard ', ' fall straint', ' impose ion', ' impose para']"

"On the other hand, the applicants did not concede that the resultant interferences had been ""in accordance with the law""",conclusion,['applicant do cede ']
Entry into and search of a home by Army personnel such as occurred in the present case were explicitly permitted by section 14 (3) of the 1978 Act for the purpose of effecting arrests under that section (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) above).,premise,"[' occur case', 'entry be permit section', 'entry be permit purpose', 'entry be permit section', ' effect arrest', ' see paragraph']"
The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).,premise,"['court uphold legality', 'court uphold case', ' see paragraph']"
The short period of restraint endured by the other members of Mrs Murray’s family when they were asked to assemble in one room was held by the House of Lords to be a necessary and proper part of the procedure of arrest of Mrs Murray (see paragraph 33 above).,premise,"[' endure member', 'they be ask ', ' to assemble room', 'period be hold house', ' see paragraph']"
"The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords also confirmed that the Army’s implied lawful authority under section 14 extended to interrogating a detained person and to recording personal details of the kind contained in the standard record form (see paragraph 41 above and also paragraphs 15, 30 and 34).",premise,"['armys imply authority', ' interrogate person', ' record detail', 'company taine form', ' see paragraph']"
It is implicit in the judgments of the national courts that the retention of such details was covered by the same lawful authority derived from section 14 (see paragraph 41 in fine above).,premise,"[' derive section', ' see paragraph']"
"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above).",conclusion,"['taking have basis', ' explain judge', ' see paragraph']"
"The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above).",premise,"['taking have basis', ' explain judge', ' see paragraph']"

"It remains to be determined whether they were necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.",premise,['it remain ']
In this connection it is not for the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities its own assessment of what might be the best policy in the field of investigation of terrorist crime,premise,"['court to substitute assessment', 'court to substitute assessment']"
A certain margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take both in general and in particular cases should be left to the national authorities.,premise,['margin should be leave authority']
"The present judgment has already adverted to the responsibility of an elected government in a democratic society to protect its citizens and its institutions against the threats posed by organised terrorism and to the special problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences (see paragraphs 47, 51 and 58 above).",premise,"['judgment have advert responsibility', ' to protect citizen', ' to protect threat', ' pose terrorism', ' involve arrest', ' suspect offence', 'judgment see paragraph']"
These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes,premise,"['factor affect balance', ' to be strike exercise', ' guarantee paragraph', 'state to take measure']"
The domestic courts held that Mrs Murray was genuinely and honestly suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above).,premise,"['company hold ', 'murray be suspect mission', ' see paragraph']"
"The European Court, for its part, has found on the evidence before it that this suspicion could be regarded as reasonable for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 63 above).",premise,"['court have find evidence', 'company be regard purpose', 'ld be regard purpose', ' see paragraph']"

"The Court notes the analysis of Lord Griffiths, when he said (see paragraph 33 above): ""The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I ... regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. ...

These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes,conclusion,"['factor affect balance', ' to be strike exercise', ' guarantee paragraph', 'state to take measure']"

"In this connection it is not for the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities its own assessment of what might be the best policy in the field of investigation of terrorist crime (see the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 23, para. 49).",conclusion,"['court to substitute assessment', 'court to substitute assessment', ' see judgment']"
Neither can it be regarded as falling outside the legitimate bounds of the process of investigation of terrorist crime for the competent authorities to record and retain basic personal details concerning the arrested person or even other persons present at the time and place of arrest.,premise,"['it can be neither regard ', ' fall bound', 'authority to record ', 'authority retain detail', ' cerne person']"
None of the personal details taken during the search of the family home or during Mrs Murray’s stay at the Army centre would appear to have been irrelevant to the procedures of arrest and interrogation (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above).,premise,"[' take search', 'none would appear ', ' see paragraph']"

"The Court sees no cause, either on the facts or in law, to examine whether the less strict requirements of Article 13 (art. 13) were complied with in the present case.",conclusion,"['court see cause', 'court see fact', ' be ply case']"
since such domestic proceedings as might have been taken in relation to entry and search would have failed because domestic law provided lawful excuse for those actions.,premise,"[' might have be take relation', 'proceeding would have fail ', 'law provide excuse']"
The first applicant argued that effective remedies for her claims under Article 8 (art. 8) regarding the Army’s actions in entering and searching her house were lacking,conclusion,"['applicant argue ', ' regard action', ' search house']"
Article 13 (art. 13) guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order.,premise,"[' guarantee availability', ' to enforce substance', 'they may happen ', ' to be secure order']"
"Its effect is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent ""national authority"" both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief in meritorious cases (see, inter alia, the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 39, para. 122, and the authorities cited there).",premise,"[' to require provision', ' to require .', 'authority to deal substance', 'authority to grant relief', 'authority to grant case', ' see judgment', 'authority cite ']"

Whether the relevant domestic law as applied to Mrs Murray ensured her a sufficient level of protection of her right to respect for her private life is a substantive issue under Article 8 (art. 8).,premise,"[' apply murray', 'law ensure level']"
The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above).,premise,"['matter plain murray', 'matter plain art', ' have be find judgment', ' see paragraph']"
Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority,premise,"['number do go ', ' to guarantee remedy', 'she to have challenge tent', 'she to have challenge authority']"
The facts of the present case do not therefore disclose a violation of Article 13 (art. 13) in respect of the first applicant.,conclusion,"['fact do number ', ' disclose violation']"
"(see the James and Others judgment, loc. cit.).",premise,[' see judgment']
Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority,conclusion,"['number do go ', ' to guarantee remedy', 'she to have challenge tent', 'she to have challenge authority']"
"Family ties cannot imply a criminal relationship between the author of the offence and his or her relatives; nor can the ""co-operative"" nature of the crime be considered a valid basis for a reasonable suspicion of complicity on the part of members of the family or friends of the criminal.",premise,"['tie can not imply relationship', 'nature can be sidere basis']"
These circumstances may give rise only to a bona fide suspicion of such complicity.,premise,"['circumstance may give rise', 'circumstance may give suspicion']"
"They do not give rise to a ""reasonable"" suspicion such as to justify the serious measures taken against the applicants unless they are connected with other facts in direct relation to the offence.",premise,"['they do give rise', 'they do give suspicion', ' to justify measure', ' take applicant', 'they be necte fact', 'they be necte relation']"
"No facts of this kind have however been furnished by the respondent Government, although, in our opinion, they could have been supplied without jeopardising the confidentiality of the source of information which is necessary to protect the life and personal safety of that source (paragraph 52 of the judgment).",premise,"['fact have be furnish government', 'they have be supply ', ' jeopardise fidentiality', ' to protect life']"

"Regarding the alleged violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, in our view the evidence as to Mrs Murray’s questioning at the military screening centre (paragraphs 16 to 27 of the judgment), the vague indications and the questions put to her lack the necessary precision to justify a conclusion that she was informed of the reasons for her arrest.",premise,"[' regard violation', 'murrays question centre', ' put she', 'evidence lack precision', ' to justify clusion', 'she be inform reason']"
"From the recorded questions about her brothers or ""about money and about America"", it is not possible for us to conclude that it was apparent to her ""that she was questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"".",premise,['she be question involvement']
"In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that ""[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty.",premise,"['court declare ', 'company tain safeguard', 'person should know ', 'he be be deprive liberty']"

"The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case.",premise,"[' state paragraph', ' to determine dition', ' lay c', '5 have be fulfil circumstance', 'c have be fulfil circumstance']"
"With due respect to the review that the national courts have conducted of the facts of the case (paragraph 60 of the judgment) and to their findings and conclusions in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, it falls to our Court, pursuant to Article 19 (art. 19) of the Convention, to ensure the observance of the engagement undertaken by the States Parties under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure everyone within their jurisdiction, inter alia, the right to liberty and the right to respect for private life.",premise,"[' have ducte fact', ' have ducte paragraph', ' bring murray', 'it fall court', ' to ensure observance', ' undertake party', ' undertake art', ' to secure everyone', ' to secure jurisdiction', ' to respect life']"
In the exercise of this power of review the Court must ascertain whether the essence of the safeguard afforded by this provision of the Convention has been secured.,premise,"['court must ascertain ', ' afford provision', 'essence have be secure ']"
"""Consequently, the respondent Government have to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence"" (Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 18, para. 34).",conclusion,"['government have ', ' to furnish fact', ' satisfy court', 'person be suspect offence']"
"As to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention, since Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention were in breach of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), she was entitled to an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with this provision.",premise,"['she be entitle right', 'she be entitle accordance']"
"We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5).",premise,"['we would recall ', 'court find violation']"
The alleged violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is directly linked with the issues under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention.,premise,['8) be link issue']
"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).",conclusion,"['breach having be find ', ' to have occur circumstance', ' take army', ' interfere life', 'measure can be not regard accordance']"
"Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2).",premise,"['breach having be find ', ' to have occur circumstance', ' take army', ' interfere life', 'measure can be not regard accordance']"
We therefore also find a violation of this provision of the Convention.,conclusion,['we find violation']
"because of the short duration of the detention,",premise,[]
"In the concrete circumstances of the case, I am prepared to allow that promptness can be waived",conclusion,['promptness can be waive ']
"once the first applicant was arrested (and not merely asked to go voluntarily to a place designated for interrogation) she was entitled to be told why she was being arrested - which in effect means ""that she was suspected of having committed a given offence"".",premise,"['applicant be arrest ', 'number ask ', ' to go place', ' designate interrogation', 'she be be arrest ', 'which mean ', 'she be suspect ', ' having mitte offence']"
"Once that is done, the further information that she was being charged with a given offence can, within a reasonable time, follow.",premise,"['that be do ', 'she be be charge offence', 'information can follow ']"
"This, however, must be preceded by the first phase, wherein the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for the arrest.",premise,"['this must be precede phase', 'person must be inform reason']"
"This phase cannot be skipped, ignored or disregarded, especially when, as in this case, the person arrested is not charged with an offence.",premise,"['phase can be not skip ', 'phase ignore ', ' be charge offence']"
"In the view of the majority (paragraph 77 of the judgment) this guarantee was satisfied because ""it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA"", which induces the Court to come to the conclusion that ""the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview"".",premise,"['she be be question involvement', 'which induce court', 'which induce to', 'reason be bring attention', 'reason be bring interview']"
And therefore there was no violation.,conclusion,['there be violation']
"In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future.",premise,"['decision reduce meaning', 'it be adhere form', 'it can have application', 'it can have future']"
"In fact what is being held here is that through the contents of an interrogation an accused person can, by inference or deduction, arrive, on his own, to understand ""the reasons for his arrest and ... any charge against him"".",premise,"['what be be hold ', 'person can arrive own', ' to understand reason']"
"Since the Convention obliges the investigating officer ""to inform"" the arrested person, I cannot agree that the duty imposed on the investigating officer can be satisfied by the obligation of the arrested person to carry out a logical exercise so that he will thereby know of the charge against him - surmising both, from the contents of the interrogation.",conclusion,"['convention oblige officer', ' to inform person', 'i can not agree ', ' impose officer', 'duty can be satisfy obligation', ' to carry exercise', 'he will know charge', ' surmise both', ' surmise tent']"
It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).,premise,[' to sustain interpretation']
"If it is sustained, then it would mean that the guarantee therein contemplated will only come into play in situations such as that which is described in Franz Kafka’s masterpiece The Trial, where the Inspector, who is supposed to interrogate K (the accused person), tells K , ""I can’t even confirm that you are charged with an offence, or rather I don’t know whether you are.",premise,"['it be sustain ', 'it would mean play', 'it would mean situation', 'guarantee will company ', 'which be describe masterpiece', 'who be suppose ', ' to interrogate k', 'inspector tell k', 'you be charge offence', 'i do not know ']"
"You are under arrest certainly, more than that I do not know.""",premise,['i do know ']
"English translation by W. and E. Muir from the German original Der Prozess – Penguin reprint 1953, p. 18.",premise,[]
"Therefore, the interpretation arrived at is a substantial limitation of the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2), to which I cannot subscribe, and I find that there was a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).",conclusion,"['i can not subscribe ', 'i find ', 'there be violation']"
"In the examination of the matter of ""reasonable suspicion"", the key issue seems to me to be whether ""at least some facts or information"" were furnished by the Government, which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence.",premise,"['issue seem i', 'fact be furnish government', 'which would satisfy observer', 'person may have mitte offence']"
In my opinion this condition of reasonableness was not fulfilled.,premise,['dition be fulfil ']
"It was suggested by the representative of the Government that ""primary facts"", obtained from a reliable confidential source, which cannot be disclosed must be differentiated from ""something other than the primary facts or information"".",premise,"['it be suggest representative', ' obtain source', 'which can be not disclose ', 'fact must be differentiate something']"
"Elements of the latter kind, he claimed, had been provided which should be capable of so satisfying an objective observer.",premise,"['he claim ', 'element have be provide ', ' satisfy observer']"
"He cited: (a) the honest belief of the arresting officer, (b) the briefing by a superior officer, and (c) circumstances preventing disclosure of information.",premise,"['he cite belief', ' prevent disclosure']"
"In my view all three are capable of satisfying the condition of an honest or genuine suspicion, but do not constitute ""at least some facts or information"" on which a reasonable suspicion could be based.",premise,"[' satisfy dition', 'company do stitute fact', 'company ld be base ']"
"Neither honesty of an arresting officer, nor honesty of superior officer, nor the circumstances of a suspected terrorist crime fall into this category.",premise,['honesty fall category']
"At the hearing the Government’s representative also identified three other kinds of more specific ""objective evidence"", namely the conviction of the first applicant’s brothers, her contacts with them and her visits to America.",premise,['representative identify kind']
"The problem with these facts, as I see it, is that none of them per se may be held against the first applicant to incriminate her.",premise,"['i see it', 'e may be hold applicant', ' to incriminate she']"
"They rather resemble the incrimination of a person’s status, in this case the first applicant’s kinship relationship.",premise,['they resemble incrimination']
"I am therefore led to conclude that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in respect of the first applicant, following the reasoning in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment (judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182).",conclusion,"['i be lead clude', ' follow reasoning']"
"A usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be.",premise,"['rt will be call ', 'officer entertain suspicion', ' mitte detainee', ' to enable person', ' to assess lawfulness', ' take step', ' to challenge it']"
This difference may justify differential treatment of evidence supporting such reasons in terms of their confidentiality.,conclusion,"['difference may justify treatment', ' support reason']"
because I do not see a necessary link between the breach of the requirements of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the interference in the private and family life of Mrs Murray (and her family).,premise,['i do see link']
I voted for non-violation of Article 8 (art. 8),conclusion,['i vote -violation']
