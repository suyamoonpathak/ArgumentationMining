The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition.,premise,"['court recognise ', 'offence can not lend itself', 'offence can not lend definition']"
"National authorities must therefore be afforded a degree of flexibility in assessing whether the facts of a particular case fall within the accepted definition of the offence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky judgment cited above at paragraph 40, p. 73, para. 41).",conclusion,"['authority must be afford degree', 'fact fall definition', ' cite .']"

The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society.,premise,"['court recall ', 'company stitute one']"
"As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities.",premise,"['10 recognise ', 'exercise carry duty', 'exercise carry it']"
"Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49).",premise,"[' see judgment', ' cite paragraph', ' cite .']"
"No restriction on freedom of expression, whether in the context of religious beliefs or in any other, can be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) unless it satisfies, inter alia, the test of necessity as required by the second paragraph of that Article (art. 10-2).",conclusion,"['it satisfy test', ' require paragraph']"

The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution.,conclusion,"['christian would view video', 'risk be reduce ', ' to impose restriction', ' to impose distribution']"
"Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above).",premise,"['ld have be reduce ', ' restrict distribution', ' see paragraph']"
"Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it.",premise,"['film would have be dispense box', 'which would have include description', 'adult would have be front it']"
"The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities.",premise,"['number e ', 'they become ', 'they can be ie ', 'they lend ', ' view home', ' escape form']"

Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.,conclusion,"[' having reach clusion', 'they do ', 'it can be not say ', 'authority overstep margin']"
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",premise,"['fact remain ', 'there be ground', 'state can impose restriction', 'state can impose basis']"
In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.,premise,[]
It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.,premise,['10 must be sidere ']
"Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).",premise,"[' bear safeguard', ' bear mind', ' embody definition', ' see paragraph', ' to justify measure', 'reason can be sidere purpose']"

Against this background the national authorities were entitled to consider that the impugned measure was justified as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Art. 10-2). There has therefore been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (Art. 10).,conclusion,"['authority be entitle ', 'measure be justify ']"

In the present case no complaint had been made to the European Court under that Article (art. 14).,premise,"['plaint have be make court', 'plaint have be make art']"

In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference.,premise,"['there be interference', 'they seek ', 'member have call interference']"
The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.,premise,"['interference be base opinion', 'they understand feeling', 'they claim ']"
The actual opinion of believers remains unknown.,premise,['opinion remain ']
"I think that this is why we cannot conclude that the interference corresponded to a ""pressing social need"".",conclusion,"['i think ', 'we can not clude ', 'company respond need']"
"The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment).",premise,"['law protect religion', ' see paragraph']"
The aim of the interference was therefore to protect the Christian faith alone and not other beliefs.,conclusion,[' to protect faith']

Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity.,premise,"['impression be veye image', 'which may shock ', 'which disturb feeling']"
"In my view, the makers of the film in issue did not exceed the reasonable limit beyond which it can be said that objects of religious veneration have been reviled or ridiculed.",conclusion,"['maker do exceed limit', 'it can be say ', 'object have be revile ', 'object ridicule ']"
"since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith.",premise,"['it be base law', ' limit protection']"
In any event - the applicant further submitted - the restriction on the film’s distribution could not pursue a legitimate aim,conclusion,"['applicant submit ', 'restriction pursue aim']"
"The Government contended that the applicant’s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive.",premise,"['company tend ', ' to cause offence', 'it amount attack']"
"In those circumstances, in refusing to grant a classification certificate for the applicant’s video work, the national authorities only acted within their margin of appreciation.",conclusion,"[' to grant certificate', 'authority act margin']"
"The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect ""the rights of others"", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above).",premise,"['court observe ', ' to grant certificate', 'refusal be intend ', ' to protect right', ' to provide protection', ' regard christians', ' see paragraph']"
The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context.,premise,"['applicant make reference', 'law see paragraph', 'which pursue aim']"
"As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries.",premise,"[' file intervenor', 'observation see paragraph']"
It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether.,premise,"['application have become ', 'states have repeal they']"
In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above).,premise,"[' cerne blasphemy', 'prosecution have be bring year', ' see paragraph']"
"Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above).",premise,"['argument have be advance example', 'law may discriminate faith', ' put applicant', ' to deal matter', ' recognise minister', ' see paragraph']"
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",conclusion,"['fact remain ', 'there be ground', 'state can impose restriction', 'state can impose basis']"
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49).",premise,[' cite paragraph']
"However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention",conclusion,"['fact remain ', 'there be ground', 'state can impose restriction', 'state can impose basis']"
"Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ""the protection of the rights of others"" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions.",premise,['there be ception']
"What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations.",premise,"[' to cause offence', ' to cause person', 'be will vary time', 'be will vary era', ' characterise array']"
"By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the ""necessity"" of a ""restriction"" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35).",premise,"[' to give opinion', ' to protect those', ' to protect material', 'feeling would be offend ', ' see judgment']"
This does not of course exclude final European supervision.,premise,"['this do exclude supervision', 'number do exclude supervision']"
Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material,premise,"[' give breadth', ' take material']"
In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important.,conclusion,[]
"Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60).",premise,"['case involve restraint', 'fact call scrutiny', ' see observer']"
The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).,premise,"[' rely authority', ' to justify measure', ' interfere freedom']"
"As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion.",premise,"[' regard tent', 'court observe ', 'law do prohibit expression']"
Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit.,premise,"['it can be say ', 'opinion fall ambit']"
"As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control.",premise,"['rt have indicate ', ' see paragraph', 'view be advocate ', 'law seek ']"
"The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives ""contemptuous"", ""reviling"", ""scurrilous"", ""ludicrous"" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness.",premise,[' to depict material']
"The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness.",premise,"['that must be attain ', 'degree stitute safeguard', 'degree stitute itself', 'company stitute safeguard', 'company stitute itself']"
It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.,conclusion,['10 must be sidere ']
