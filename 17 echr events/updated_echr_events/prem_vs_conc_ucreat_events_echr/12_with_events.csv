"The Court recalls that the scope of its jurisdiction is determined by the Commission’s decision on admissibility and that it has no power to entertain new and separate complaints which were not raised before the Commission (see, inter alia, the Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 293, para. 44).",premise,"['court recall ', 'scope be determine decision', 'it have power', ' to entertain plaint', 'which be raise ', 'commission see judgment']"
"However, while Mr Findlay in his application to the Commission may not expressly have invoked his rights under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) to a ""public hearing"" and a ""tribunal established by law"", he does appear to have raised in substance most of the matters which form the basis of his complaints in relation to these two provisions.",premise,"['findlay may have invoke right', 'findlay may have invoke .', ' establish law', 'he do appear ', ' to have raise most', ' to have raise substance', 'which form basis', 'which form relation']"
"Thus, in the Commission’s decision on admissibility, he is reported as referring in particular to the facts that the members of the court martial were appointed ad hoc, that the judge advocate’s advice on sentencing was not disclosed, that no reasons were given for the decisions taken by the court-martial board and the confirming and reviewing officers, and that the post-hearing reviews were essentially administrative in nature and conducted in private (see the Commission’s decision on admissibility, application no. 22107/93, pp. 32 35).",premise,"['he be report ', ' refer fact', 'member be appoint ', 'advice be disclose ', 'reason be give ', ' take board', ' review officer', ' see decision']"
"It follows that these are not new and separate complaints, and that the Court has jurisdiction to consider these matters (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, p. 46, para. 80).",conclusion,"['it follow ', 'court have jurisdiction', 'matter see judgment']"
"since they involved the determination of Mr Findlay’s sentence following his plea of guilty to criminal charges; indeed, this point was not disputed before it",premise,"['they involve determination', ' follow plea', 'point be dispute it']"
"(see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 18 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 33-36, paras. 80-85, and the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 34-35, paras. 76-77).",premise,[' see judgment']
"In the view of the Court, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is clearly applicable to the court-martial proceedings,",conclusion,[]
"because, inter alia, all the officers appointed to it were directly subordinate to the convening officer who also performed the role of prosecuting authority",premise,"[' appoint it', 'who perform role']"
The lack of legal qualification or experience in the officers making the decisions either at the court martial or review stages made it impossible for them to act in an independent or impartial manner.,premise,"['officer make decision', 'officer make stage', 'lack make ', 'they to act manner']"
"The applicant complained that the court martial was not an ""independent and impartial tribunal"" as required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6 1),",conclusion,"['company plain ', ' require para']"
"because the statutory framework according to which it proceeded was too vague and imprecise; for example, it was silent on the question of how the convening officer, confirming officer and reviewing authorities were to be appointed.",premise,['it proceed ']
"Finally, he claimed that his court martial was not a tribunal ""established by law"",",conclusion,"['he claim ', ' establish law']"
"The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay’s case.",premise,"['court observe ', 'officer play role', 'officer play hearing']"
He decided which charges should be brought and which type of court martial was most appropriate.,premise,"['he decide ', 'charge should be bring ']"
He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).,premise,"['company vene ', 'company appoint member', ' see paragraph']"
"Under the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible.",premise,"['he have task', ' send abstract', ' send officer', ' indicate passage']"
"He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those ""reasonably requested"" by the defence.",premise,"['he procure attendance', ' request defence']"
His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).,premise,"['officer accept plea', 'agreement be seek ', 'charge be withdraw ', ' see paragraph']"
"For these reasons the Court, like the Commission, considers that the convening officer was central to Mr Findlay’s prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities.",conclusion,"['court sider ', 'company sider ', ' link authority']"
The question therefore arises whether the members of the court martial were sufficiently independent of the convening officer and whether the organisation of the trial offered adequate guarantees of impartiality.,premise,"['question arise ', 'organisation offer guarantee']"
"It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above).",premise,"[' appoint officer', ' include president', 'mand see paragraph']"
"Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above).",premise,"['officer have power', 'officer have circumstance', ' to dissolve company', ' see paragraph']"
"Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified",conclusion,"['which decide case', 'member fall chain', 'doubt be justify ']"
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Sramek v. Austria judgment of 22 October 1984, Series A no. 84, p. 20, para. 42).",premise,[]
"Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified",conclusion,"['which decide case', 'member fall chain', 'doubt be justify ']"
". Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified",premise,"['which decide case', 'member fall chain', 'doubt be justify ']"
"In addition, the Court finds it significant that the convening officer also acted as ""confirming officer"".",premise,"['court find ', 'officer act officer']"
"Thus, the decision of the court martial was not effective until ratified by him, and he had the power to vary the sentence imposed as he saw fit (see paragraph 48 above). This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of ""tribunal"" and can also be seen as a component of the ""independence"" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45).",conclusion,"[' ratify he', 'he have power', ' to vary sentence', 'he see ', ' see paragraph', ' to give decision', 'which may be alter authority', 'power can be see ponent', ' require para']"
"The Court further agrees with the Commission that these fundamental flaws in the court-martial system were not remedied by the presence of safeguards, such as the involvement of the judge advocate, who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public (see paragraphs 45-46 above), or the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board (see paragraph 35 above).",premise,"['court agree commission', 'flaw be remedie presence', 'advice be make public', ' see paragraph', ' take member', ' see paragraph']"
Nor could the defects referred to above (in paragraphs 75 and 77) be corrected by any subsequent review proceedings.,premise,"[' refer paragraph', 'defect be recte proceeding']"
"Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as ""criminal"" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para.",conclusion,"[' cerne charge', ' classify law', 'hearing be entitle tribunal', 'he be entitle tribunal', 'which meet requirement']"
"(see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, pp. 16-18, paras. 31-32).",premise,[' see judgment']
"Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as ""criminal"" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para.",conclusion,"[' cerne charge', ' classify law', 'hearing be entitle tribunal', 'he be entitle tribunal', 'which meet requirement']"
"First, there were no grounds for believing that the applicant would not have been convicted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment and dismissed from the army following his trial (at which he pleaded guilty), even if the court martial had been differently organised.",premise,"['there be ground', 'applicant would have be victe ', 'applicant sentence term', ' dismiss army', ' dismiss trial', ' follow trial', 'he plead ', 'applicant be organise ']"
"Secondly, it was in any case unlikely that he would have enjoyed a long career in the army, in view of the post traumatic stress disorder and back injury from which he suffered (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 30 above); he had already received GBP 100,000 in settlement of his civil claim against the Ministry of Defence, a large part of which related to loss of earning capacity.",premise,"['he would have enjoy career', 'he suffer ', ' see paragraph', 'he have receive 100,000', 'he have receive settlement', 'part relate loss']"
"The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient satisfaction, or, in the alternative, that only a very modest amount should be awarded.",conclusion,"['government submit ', 'finding would stitute satisfaction', 'amount should be award ']"
"At the hearing, the Commission’s Delegate observed that no causal link had been established between the breach of the Convention complained of by the applicant and the alleged pecuniary damage, and submitted that it was not possible to speculate as to whether the proceedings would have led to a different outcome had they fulfilled the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",premise,"['delegate observe ', 'link have be establish breach', ' plain applicant', 'delegate submit ', 'proceeding would have lead outcome', 'they have fulfil requirement']"
"The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient satisfaction, or, in the alternative, that only a very modest amount should be awarded.",conclusion,"['government submit ', 'finding would stitute satisfaction', 'amount should be award ']"
"(see, for example, the Schmautzer v. Austria judgment of 23 October 1995, Series A no. 328-A, p. 16, para. 44).",premise,"[' see judgment', ' see example']"
The Court agrees; it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the court-martial proceedings might have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred,conclusion,"['court agree ', 'it can not speculate ', 'violation have occur ']"
"The complaint concerning Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement 64. In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. The Judge Advocate General, Judge Rant, had commented: ""These are extremely serious allegations ..."". In a later letter, Judge Rant wrote: ""I wish to make it clear that, at this stage and without prejudice to any action which might have to be taken in the future, I am making no formal complaint about the passage [from the applicant’s submission to the Commission] quoted in that letter. The reason for this is that the case of Findlay is to be argued before the European Court of Human Rights in September 1996 and therefore it is only proper for me to defer action until the end of those proceedings.""",premise,"[' cerne article', ' see paragraph', 'applicant assert ', ' cerne matter', 'general have plain ', 'solicitor have make allegation', 'solicitor have make advice', ' cerne lack', ' give office', 'general have mente ', 'rant write ', 'i wish ', 'which might have ', ' to be take future', 'i be make plaint', ' quote letter', ' to be argue court', ' to be argue september', 'i to defer action', 'i to defer end']"

The applicant alleged that his solicitor felt constrained in presenting his arguments to the Court in the knowledge that they might subsequently form the basis of disciplinary proceedings and he invoked his rights under Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement relating to Persons Participating in Proceedings before the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.,conclusion,"['applicant allege ', 'solicitor feel ', ' present argument', ' present court', ' present knowledge', 'they might form basis', 'he invoke right', ' relate persons', ' participate proceeding']"
