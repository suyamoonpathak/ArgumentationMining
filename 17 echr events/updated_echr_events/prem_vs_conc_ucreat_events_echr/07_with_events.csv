"It should have scrutinised the lower courts' judgments in the light of Article 10 (art. 10), that is: should have critically examined whether their findings of fact and their reasoning were sufficiently solid to justify convincingly the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression.",premise,"['it should have scrutinise judgment', 'it should have scrutinise light', ' to justify interference']"
