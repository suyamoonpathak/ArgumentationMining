"Indeed, when preparing their reports, the experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health of the years 1988-1990.",argumentative,"[' prepare report', 'expert rely report']"
It has therefore not sufficiently been made out that the applicant's ailments arose as the direct consequence of his detention,argumentative,"['it have be make ', 'ailment arise sequence']"

The grounds given could in fact serve for any arrest.,non-argumentative,['ground serve arrest']
"Furthermore, according to Section 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it did not suffice if the detention was justified on the ground that the applicant risked a sentence of more than ten years' imprisonment, since para. 2 of Section 152 required as grounds for detention a danger of absconding or of committing a further crime.",non-argumentative,"[' accord section', 'detention be justify ground', 'applicant risk sentence', '2 require danger', '2 require ground', 'company mitte crime']"

(This provision) contains two cumulative prerequisites - misappropriation must have occurred on a large scale and must have been particularly serious.,non-argumentative,"['provision tain prerequisite', 'company tain prerequisite', 'misappropriation must have occur scale']"
The particularly large scale derives from the nominal value of the public property involved.,non-argumentative,['scale derive value']

The argument that the hypothesis of Section 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies in this case is groundless.,non-argumentative,['2 apply case']

"The logical and systematic interpretation of the aforesaid provision imposes the conclusion that the measure of restriction, 'detention', in the context of the Penal Code is determined by the high level of public danger of the act and by the special status of the person who has committed it and is the subject of the crime, a member of the National Assembly.",non-argumentative,"['interpretation impose clusion', 'measure be determine level', 'who have mitte it']"
"For this reason the legislator envisaged a qualified measure of restriction, detention, in similar cases.",non-argumentative,['legislator envisage measure']
