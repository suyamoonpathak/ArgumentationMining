"The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes.",argumentative,"[' mitte person', 'crime should be punish ']"
"In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive.",argumentative,[]
"In support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 21 and 23 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose.",argumentative,"['applicant refer origin', ' see paragraph', 'it have purpose']"
"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 23 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"").",argumentative,"['he refer wording', 'person shall number ', ' victe murder', ' be sentence imprisonment', ' see paragraph', ' use sentence', ' use pleasure']"
"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence.",argumentative,"['company clude ', ' examine court', ' examine case']"
"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence",argumentative,"['company clude ', ' examine court', ' examine case']"
"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76).",argumentative,['tariff have expire ']
This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.,argumentative,[]
"It follows that at that phase in the execution of his sentence, the applicant was entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention determined by a court at reasonable intervals.",argumentative,"['it follow ', 'applicant be entitle para', 'lawfulness determine rt', 'lawfulness determine interval']"
"The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness.",argumentative,"['government tend ', 'company tend ', 'sentence have character', 'sentence be impose murderer', 'sentence be impose strength']"
This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).,argumentative,"['this explain ', 'procedure govern sentence', ' pass adult', 'policy be apply both', 'this see paragraph']"
"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 32 above).",argumentative,"['period have elapse ', 'dangerousness must be sidere ', ' maintain fidence', ' maintain system', ' see paragraph']"
"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults.",argumentative,"['it be tend ', ' sentence detention', 'person would be detain prison', 'person would be detain stage']"
"In these circumstances, the issues in the present case were practically identical to those in the Wynne case (cited above at paragraph 47) where the Court found that the original trial and appeal proceedings satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",argumentative,"[' cite paragraph', 'court find ', 'trial satisfy requirement']"
"Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",argumentative,"[' to require lawfulness', 'detention to be examine rt', ' satisfy requirement']"
It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.,argumentative,"['it be recall ', 'applicant be sentence age', ' to be detain pleasure']"
"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence.",argumentative,"['company tain element', 'tariff be set ', ' to reflect requirement']"
"However an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public.",argumentative,"['term can be justify sideration', ' base need', ' to protect public']"
"These considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older.",argumentative,"[' centre assessment', 'sideration must take development', 'sideration must take account', 'he grow ']"
"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",argumentative,"['that occur maturation', 'failure would mean ', ' detain section', 'person would be treat ', ' having forfeit liberty', ' having forfeit rest', 'applicant point ', 'which might give rise', 'which might give question']"
"Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence.",argumentative,['company clude ']
"The Court notes at the outset that, as has been commonly accepted, the central issue in the present case is whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment.",argumentative,"['number e outset', ' give nature', 'detention should be assimilate law', 'detention should be assimilate sentence']"
"In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 34) or to that in the more recent case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom (cited at paragraph 47).",argumentative,"[' deal issue', 'court must decide ', 'substance be relate that', ' cite paragraph', ' cite paragraph']"
"This was, albeit in a different context, the view expressed by the Divisional Court in its judgment of 20 April 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh - see paragraph 24 above).",argumentative,"[' express court', ' express judgment', ' see paragraph']"
"The decisive ground for the applicant’s continued detention was and continues to be his dangerousness to society, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time.",argumentative,['company tinue ']

"Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence.",argumentative,['company clude ']
"Accordingly, new issues of lawfulness may arise in the course of detention and the applicant is entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to take proceedings to have these issues decided by a court at reasonable intervals",argumentative,"['issue may arise rse', 'applicant be entitle para', ' to take proceeding', 'issue decide rt', 'issue decide interval']"

"The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing",argumentative,"['court recall text', 'question arise ', 'which involve assessment', 'which involve example', 'it have hold ']"

Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.,argumentative,"[' require hearing', ' involve representation', ' question witness']"
It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.,argumentative,"[' to obtain hearing', ' institute proceeding']"
"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about.",argumentative,"[' presuppose existence', ' presuppose necessity', ' institute proceeding', ' to bring it']"
"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",argumentative,"[' obtain hearing', ' obtain way', ' satisfy requirement']"
"In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that the applicant, after the expiry of his tariff, was unable to bring the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure before a court with the powers and procedural guarantees satisfying that provision (art. 5-4).",argumentative,"['court find ', ' to bring case', ' to bring company', ' satisfy art']"
