"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).",argumentative,"['court point ', 'it hold ']"
They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.,argumentative,"['they differ respect', 'they differ those']"
"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.",argumentative,"['it remain ', 'provision apply art', ' be ere reservation']"
"The Court notes that Mr Pramstaller based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.",argumentative,"['number e ', 'pramstaller base plaint', 'pramstaller base art', ' invoke government', 'wording mention art', ' make reference']"
"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.",argumentative,"['company e play', ' indicate it', 'provision have be apply ']"
"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Tyrol Building Regulations Act 1978, were applied.",argumentative,['provision be apply ']
These considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.,argumentative,['reservation do apply case']
"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.",argumentative,['review be fine issue']

"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"".",argumentative,"['it follow that', 'regard must be have ', ' raise company', ' raise rt', ' raise applicant', 'that have jurisdiction']"

"In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.",argumentative,"['it reach clusion', 'court be sit proceeding']"
"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one.",argumentative,"['one can not infer ', ' afford tribunal', ' to review decision', 'safeguard differ those', ' require case']"

"On 17 March 1987 Nußdorf-Debant municipal council granted Mr Pramstaller planning permission for the construction of new commercial premises, subject to various detailed conditions: two groceries should be built, each with appropriate commercial and sanitary amenities and separate entrances; and a dividing wall was to be erected between the two shops.",non-argumentative,"['ncil grant permission', 'grocery should be build ', ' to be erect shop']"

"An inspection of the site had shown that, contrary to the terms of the planning permission, only one larger shop was being built instead of the two smaller ones.",non-argumentative,"['inspection have show ', 'shop be be build one']"
The applicant had thus disregarded several conditions of the planning permission.,non-argumentative,['applicant have disregard dition']

"An appeal by him to the Tyrol regional government (Amt der Landesregierung) was dismissed on 22 March 1988 on the ground, among others, that the works carried out by the applicant not only failed to comply with the permission granted but were in part illegal.",non-argumentative,"['appeal be dismiss march', 'appeal be dismiss ground', ' carry number', 'work fail permission']"
"Mr Pramstaller then applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), alleging, inter alia, a violation of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention in that he had not been able to bring his case, or have an oral hearing held, before a tribunal which conformed with that provision (art. 6).",non-argumentative,"['pramstaller apply court', ' allege violation', ' to bring case', ' have tribunal', 'hearing hold ', 'company form art']"
"On 16 September 1988 the Constitutional Court declined to accept the case for adjudication under Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes- Verfassungsgesetz - see paragraph 18 below) as raising questions concerning the application of ordinary law (einfaches Gesetz); in so far as the complaint did raise issues of constitutional law, the Constitutional Court found that the application did not have sufficient prospects of success.",non-argumentative,"['court decline ', ' to accept case', ' to accept .', ' see paragraph', ' raise question', ' raise gesetz', ' cerne application', 'plaint do raise issue', 'court find ', 'application do have prospect']"
"The applicant then requested to have his case transferred to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof), with which grounds of appeal against the administrative authorities' decision were subsequently lodged.",non-argumentative,"['applicant request ', 'case transfer court', 'ground be lodge ']"
On 14 September 1989 the applicant's appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Court pursuant to section 42(1) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz - see paragraph 22 below).,non-argumentative,"['appeal be dismiss court', ' see paragraph']"

Only in special circumstances was a hearing to be held.,non-argumentative,['hearing be to be hold ']
The Administrative Court then dealt with the remaining complaints as follows:,non-argumentative,['court deal plaint']
"The applicant further submitted that the impugned decision dealt only with the obligation, noted in the decision at first instance, to obtain permission not to erect the dividing wall, and not with the obligation to obtain permission for the other - in his view minimal - failures to comply with the plan.",non-argumentative,"['applicant submit ', 'decision deal obligation', ' e decision', ' e instance', ' to obtain number', ' to erect wall', ' to obtain permission', ' ply plan']"
"But as, he maintained, the question whether these other failures to comply with the plan might lead to the applicant's being punished was of importance if the failure to erect the wall was not punishable, the reasoning was inadequate.",non-argumentative,"['he maintain ', ' to ply plan', 'failure might lead ', 'applicant be punish ', ' to erect wall']"
"This submission is inaccurate, because the respondent authority did in fact, as it was entitled to do, take it for granted that planning permission was necessary for all the measures mentioned in the original decision.",non-argumentative,"['authority do be entitle ', 'it do be entitle ', ' take it', ' mention decision']"
"The major building works undertaken by the applicant were, as the file shows, not covered by permission from the planning authorities.",non-argumentative,"[' undertake applicant', 'file show ', ' ere permission']"
There was also clearly a consistent intention to go ahead and build in disregard of the planning regulations.,non-argumentative,"['there be intention', ' build disregard']"
"The applicant further overlooks that, quite apart from the principle that planning permission was necessary for such a building project, permission could never have been given for a shopping centre such as was built in the instant case, having regard to the provision in section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act, which was declared constitutional by the Constitutional Court in a decision (B 816/86) of 2 March 1988.",non-argumentative,"['applicant overlook ', 'permission have be never give regard', ' be build case', ' have regard', 'which be declare stitutional', 'which be declare court', 'which be declare decision']"
During the planning-application proceedings Mr Pramstaller acted as the applicant for planning permission and as the owner of the land and the building on it.,non-argumentative,['pramstaller act applicant']
The [Z.] firm put itself forward as the future user of the building.,non-argumentative,"['firm put itself', 'firm put user']"
The applicant never disputed during the administrative criminal proceedings that he was the person for whom the building was being constructed and that he was thus liable in administrative criminal law.,non-argumentative,"['applicant never dispute proceeding', 'building be be structe ']"
His submission that the dividing wall was not built not on his orders but on those of the [Z.] firm that was using the commercial premises can therefore not exonerate him as he bore the responsibility for accepting and carrying out the orders of the future occupier.,non-argumentative,"['that be use premise', 'submission can exonerate he', 'he bear responsibility', ' carry order']"
The suggestion set out for the first time in the statement of facts in the supplementary application that the building was being constructed for another firm is a new submission that is inadmissible in administrative proceedings by virtue of section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act.,non-argumentative,"[' set time', ' set statement', ' set application', 'building be be structe firm']"
"It was further submitted that the suspension of the building works that had been ordered had made it impossible to erect the dividing wall, although this could have been done without substantial expenditure even after the building work had stopped, so that there had been no negligence.",non-argumentative,"['it be submit ', 'that have be order ', 'suspension have make ', ' to erect wall', 'company ld have be do expenditure', 'work have stop ']"
This submission likewise cannot assist the applicant.,non-argumentative,['submission can not assist applicant']
"As the evidence and the applicant's submission clearly show, there had been no intention to build the dividing wall even before building work was suspended; on the contrary, the applicant deliberately refrained from doing so in order to secure a review of section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act by the Constitutional Court.",non-argumentative,"['evidence show ', ' to build wall', 'work be suspend trary', 'applicant refrain ', ' to secure review']"
"Furthermore, at the time when the building works were suspended, there were other important failures to comply with the planning permission for which approval would have been needed (see in the statement of facts the details of the findings made by the authority on 6 July 1987 during an inspection of the works).",non-argumentative,"['work be suspend ', 'there be failure', ' to ply permission', 'approval would have be need ', ' see detail', ' see statement', ' make authority', ' make july', ' make inspection']"
The subsequent suspension of building work is accordingly of no legal significance in the present context.,non-argumentative,[]
The respondent authority also rightly noted that the very fact of the repeatedly expressed intention not to erect the dividing wall and to maintain the building in issue in a state that did not comply with the planning permission and for which no approval had been given showed that there had been culpable intent.,non-argumentative,"['authority e ', ' to erect wall', ' to maintain building', ' to maintain issue', ' to maintain state', 'that do number ply', 'that do number permission', 'approval have be give ', 'fact show ']"
"Similarly, as the respondent authority rightly recognised, the theoretical possibility that the Constitutional Court might declare section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act unconstitutional cannot be prayed in aid as a mitigating circumstance.",non-argumentative,"['authority recognise ', 'court might declare ', 'possibility can be not pray aid', 'possibility can be not pray circumstance']"
"Contrary to the applicant's submissions, this purpose could have been achieved other than through failing to comply with the planning permission by not erecting the dividing wall and carrying out unauthorised works.",non-argumentative,"['purpose have be achieve ', ' to ply permission', ' to ply number', ' erect wall', ' carry work']"
"It was open to the applicant at the outset to make an application for planning permission to build large-scale commercial premises, a shopping centre, and in this way challenge section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act in the Constitutional Court.",non-argumentative,"[' to make application', ' to build premise', ' challenge section', ' challenge court']"
"The submission on this point therefore fails. As to the submission that, contrary to what was stated in the impugned decision, the authority (municipal council) had agreed to the dividing wall not being built after a report had been made by a fire-safety expert, the applicant is referred to the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council and to the note for the file made by him on the day of the meeting, from which it is quite clear that there was disagreement between the participants over the question whether authorisation was needed not to build the dividing wall and that the applicant was expressly warned by the municipal council that under section 31 of the Tyrol Building Regulations Act read together with section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act, a building scheme that was altered in this way could not be authorised.",non-argumentative,"['submission fail ', 'what be state decision', 'ncil have agree ', 'number be build ', 'report have be make expert', 'applicant be refer evidence', ' give chairman', ' make he', ' make day', 'there be disagreement', 'authorisation be need ', ' to build wall', 'applicant be warn ncil', ' read section', 'that be alter way', 'scheme be authorise ', 'number be authorise ']"
"The applicant is mistaken in suggesting that the statement made by the legal representative of the [Z.] firm, who was also present at the meeting, constitutes a ground for excluding his guilt.",non-argumentative,"[' make representative', 'statement stitute ground', ' exclude guilt']"
From the observations filed by counsel for the applicant on the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council it appears that the whole question of suspending the building works and the issue of the constitutionality of section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act were discussed and the possibility of challenging that provision in the Constitutional Court envisaged.,non-argumentative,"[' file nsel', ' file applicant', ' file evidence', ' give chairman', 'it appear ', ' suspend work', 'question be discuss ', ' challenge provision', ' challenge court', 'possibility envisage ']"
