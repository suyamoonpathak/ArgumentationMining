"He claims that he was at no time afforded a proper determination of his civil rights and obligations with particular reference to the conjugal rights of both parties to a marriage and, moreover, that he was denied a fair trial of the charge against him by reason of the failure of the courts to observe, and give proper effect to, the statutory definition of rape (as `unlawful sexual intercourse') in section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976.""",argumentative,"['he claim ', 'he be afford determination', 'he be deny trial', 'he be deny reason', ' give effect', ' give definition', ' give section']"

There was case-law indicating that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife where a court had issued a decree nisi of divorce or a non-molestation order; where the husband had given an undertaking in lieu of an injunction not to molest his wife; where there was an agreement express or implied between the parties which made it clear that the implied consent of the wife was revoked; and where there had been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.,argumentative,"['there be law', ' rape wife', 'rt have issue decree', 'husband have give undertaking', 'husband have give lieu', ' to molest wife', 'there be agreement', 'which make ', ' send wife', 'company be revoke ', ' accompany indication', 'company have be terminate ']"

The Government contend that in the present case the facts indicated that the applicant's wife had revoked her consent by mutual agreement with the applicant.,argumentative,"[' accompany indication', ' send intercourse', 'company have be terminate ', 'company tend ', 'fact indicate ', 'wife have revoke company', ' send agreement']"
The Government submit that the applicant's conviction for the attempted rape of his wife was in conformity with Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.,argumentative,['government submit ']
"Even if the decisions of the courts were based rather on the fact that a wife was able unilaterally to withdraw her consent, this was a reasonable interpretation of the existing law in the light of changing social circumstances and clarified the existing elements of the offence.",argumentative,"['decision be base fact', 'this clarify element']"

(The applicant) married his wife on 11 August 1984.,non-argumentative,"['applicant marry wife', 'applicant marry august']"
"They had one son, who was born in 1985.",non-argumentative,"['they have son', 'who be bear 1985']"
On 11 November 1987 the parties separated for a period of about two weeks before becoming reconciled.,non-argumentative,['party separate period']
"On 21 October 1989, as a result of further matrimonial difficulties, the wife left the matrimonial home with their son, who was then aged four, and returned to live with her parents.",non-argumentative,"['wife leave home', 'wife leave son', 'who be age ', 'wife return ', ' to live parent']"
She had by this time already consulted solicitors regarding her matrimonial affairs and indeed had left a letter for (the applicant) in which she informed him that she intended to petition for divorce.,non-argumentative,"['she have sulte solicitor', ' regard affair', 'she have leave letter', 'she inform he', 'she intend ', ' to petition divorce']"
However no legal proceedings had been taken by her before the incident took place which gave rise to these criminal proceedings.,non-argumentative,"['proceeding have be take she', 'incident take place', 'which give rise', 'which give proceeding']"
It seems that (the applicant) had on 23 October spoken to his wife by telephone indicating that it was his intention also to 'see about a divorce'.,non-argumentative,"['it seem ', 'applicant have speak wife', 'applicant have speak telephone', ' to see divorce']"
"Shortly before 9 o'clock on the evening of 12 November 1989, that is to say some 22 days after the wife had returned to live with her parents, and while the parents were out, (the applicant) forced his way into the parents' house and attempted to have sexual intercourse with the wife against her will.",non-argumentative,"['wife have return ', ' to live parent', 'applicant force way', 'applicant force house', 'applicant attempt ', ' to have intercourse', ' to have wife', ' to have will']"
"In the course of that attempt he assaulted her, in particular by squeezing her neck with both hands.",non-argumentative,"['he assault she', ' squeeze neck', ' squeeze hand']"
The applicant was charged with rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.,non-argumentative,"['applicant be charge rape', ' occasion harm']"
At his trial before the Leicester Crown Court on 30 July 1990 it was submitted that the charge of rape was one which was not known to the law by reason of the fact that the applicant was the husband of the alleged victim.,non-argumentative,"['it be submit ', ' know law', ' know reason']"
"The submission was based on the pronouncement of the common law made by Sir Matthew Hale in his ""History of the Pleas of the Crown"", p. 629, published in 1736:",non-argumentative,"['submission be base pronouncement', ' make hale', ' make history', ' publish 1736']"
"But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.",non-argumentative,"[' mitte himself', ' mitte wife', 'wife hath give herself', 'wife hath give kind', 'wife hath give husband', 'she can not retract ']"
"The trial judge, Owen J., ruled that the charge could go to the jury.",non-argumentative,"['judge rule ', ' go jury']"
"He found, inter alia, that there was sufficient evidence to indicate an implied agreement to a separation and a withdrawal of consent.",non-argumentative,"['he find ', 'there be evidence', ' to indicate agreement']"
"He also considered that the common law recognised an exception to the concept of marital immunity where there has been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, and that there was again sufficient evidence to indicate that this exception applied.",non-argumentative,"['he sidere ', 'law recognise exception', ' accompany indication', ' send intercourse', 'company have be terminate ', 'there be evidence', 'exception apply ']"
"The applicant then pleaded guilty to attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.",non-argumentative,"['applicant plead ', ' occasion harm', 'applicant be sentence imprisonment']"
He appealed.,non-argumentative,['he appeal ']
The Court of Appeal held on 14 March 1991 as follows:,non-argumentative,['court hold march']
"Since the rule that a husband could not be guilty of raping his wife if he forced her to have sexual intercourse against her will was an anachronistic and offensive common law fiction which no longer represented the position of a wife in present-day society, it should no longer be applied.",non-argumentative,"[' rape wife', 'he force she', ' to have intercourse', ' to have will', 'which represent position', 'it should be apply ']"
"Instead, the principle to be applied was that a rapist remained a rapist subject to the criminal law irrespective of his relationship with his victim.",non-argumentative,['rapist remain subject']
The charge of rape had therefore properly been left to the jury.,non-argumentative,['charge have be leave jury']
The appeal would accordingly be dismissed.,non-argumentative,['appeal would be dismiss ']
The Court of Appeal's decision was unanimously upheld by the House of Lords on 23 October 1991.,non-argumentative,"['decision be uphold house', 'decision be uphold october']"
It considered that Sir Matthew Hale's common law proposition could not preclude the application of section 1 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 concerning the offence of rape.,non-argumentative,"['it sidere ', 'number preclude application', ' cerne offence']"
The House of Lords' judgment was summarised by a Times Law Report as follows:,non-argumentative,['judgment be summarise report']
For over 150 years after the publication of Hale's work there appeared to have been no reported case in which judicial consideration was given to this proposition.,non-argumentative,"['there appear ', 'sideration be give ']"
It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded as an accurate statement of the common law of England.,non-argumentative,"['it may be take ', 'proposition be regard statement']"
"The common law was however capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments.",non-argumentative,[' evolve light']
Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in those respects at the time it was enunciated.,non-argumentative,"['proposition reflect state', 'it be enunciate ']"
Since then the status of women and particularly of married women had changed out of all recognition.,non-argumentative,['status have change ']
Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies one of the most important changes was that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband,non-argumentative,['marriage be regard partnership']
Hale's proposition involved that by marriage a wife gave her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happened to be feeling at the time,non-argumentative,"['proposition involve ', 'wife give company', 'wife give circumstance', ' send intercourse', 'she happen ', ' to be feel time']"
In modern times any reasonable person had to regard that conception as quite unacceptable.,non-argumentative,"['person have ', ' to regard ception']"
The position was that part of Hale's proposition had been departed from in a series of decided cases.,non-argumentative,['part have be depart series']
On the ground of principle there was no good reason why the whole proposition of 'marital exemption' to rape should not be held inapplicable in modern times.,non-argumentative,"['there be reason', 'proposition should be hold inapplicable', 'proposition should be hold time']"
The only question was whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presented an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course.,non-argumentative,['section present obstacle']
The argument was that 'unlawful' in that subsection meant outside the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,['that mean bond']
That was not the most natural meaning of the word which normally described something which was contrary to some law or enactment or was done without lawful justification or excuse.,non-argumentative,"['which describe something', 'which be do justification']"
Certainly in modern times sexual intercourse outside marriage would not ordinarily be described as unlawful.,non-argumentative,['intercourse be describe ']
If the subsection proceeded on the basis that a woman on marriage gave a general consent to sexual intercourse there could be no question of intercourse with her by her husband being without consent.,non-argumentative,"['subsection proceed basis', 'woman give company', ' send intercourse', 'company send ']"
There would thus be no point in enacting that only intercourse without consent outside marriage was to constitute rape.,non-argumentative,[' send marriage']
"There was another important context to section 1 (1), namely the existence of the exceptions to the marital exemption established by cases decided before the Act was passed.",non-argumentative,"['there be text', ' establish case', 'act be pass ']"
Sexual intercourse in any of the cases covered by the exceptions still took place within the bond of marriage.,non-argumentative,"[' ere exception', 'intercourse take place', 'intercourse take bond']"
So if 'unlawful' in the subsection meant 'outside the bond of marriage' it followed that sexual intercourse in a case which fell within the exceptions was not covered by the definition of rape not- withstanding that it was not consented to by the wife.,non-argumentative,"['unlawful mean bond', 'it follow ', 'which fall exception', ' ere definition', ' sente wife']"
That involved that the exceptions had been impliedly abolished.,non-argumentative,"['that involve ', 'exception have be abolish ']"
If the intention of Parliament was to abolish the exceptions it would have been expected to do so expressly and it was in fact inconceivable Parliament should have had such an intention.,non-argumentative,"[' to abolish exception', 'it would have be expect ', 'parliament should have have intention']"
In order that the exceptions might be preserved it would be necessary to construe 'unlawfully' so as to give it a meaning unique to that particular subsection and if the mind of the draughtsman has been directed to the existence of the exceptions he would surely have dealt with them specifically and not in such an oblique fashion.,non-argumentative,"['exception might be preserve ', ' to give meaning', 'mind have be direct existence', 'he would have deal they']"
The fact was it was clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent and that the use of the word in the subsection added nothing.,non-argumentative,"[' to have intercourse', ' to have woman', 'company send ', 'use add hing']"
There were no rational grounds for putting the suggested gloss on the word and it should be treated as mere surplusage in the enactment.,non-argumentative,"['there be ground', ' put gloss', ' put word', 'it should be treat surplusage']"
Section 1 (1) of 1976 Act presented no obstacle to the House declaring that in modern times the supposed marital exemption in rape formed no part of the law of England.,non-argumentative,"['section present obstacle', 'section present house', 'exemption form part']"
"Until the applicant's case the English courts, on the few occasions that they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly, had always recognised at least some form of immunity as attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage.",non-argumentative,"['they be front issue', ' have recognise form', ' attach husband', ' attach charge', ' attach reason', ' to have be give wife', ' to have be give marriage']"
"The eighteenth century proposition of Sir Matthew Hale quoted above has been upheld until recently, for example in the case of R. Kowalski (1987, 86, Cr. App. R 339), which concerned the question of whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault.",non-argumentative,"['proposition have be uphold example', 'proposition have be uphold case', 'company cerne question', 'wife have sente act', ' perform company', 'which would amount assault']"
"Ian Kennedy J. giving the judgment of the court stated, obiter dicta,",non-argumentative,"[' give judgment', 'kennedy state ']"
"""It is clear, well-settled and ancient law that a man cannot, as actor, be guilty of rape upon his wife"" and he went on to say that that principle was ""dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi, by a separation order or, in certain circumstances, by a separation agreement""",non-argumentative,"['he go ', ' send intercourse', 'which arise state', 'company be put nisi']"
"In another example, Lord Justice O'Connor in the R. v. Roberts case (1986 CLR 188) stated:",non-argumentative,['oconnor state ']
"""The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she cannot unilaterally withdraw it.""",non-argumentative,"['status involve ', 'woman have give company', ' have intercourse', ' have subsistence', 'she can not withdraw it']"
Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976,non-argumentative,[]
"Section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides, in so far as it is material, as follows:",non-argumentative,['section provide ']
"""For the purposes of section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which relates to rape) a man commits rape if",non-argumentative,"['which relate rape', 'company mit rape']"
"he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it...""",non-argumentative,"['he have intercourse', 'he have woman', 'who do send it']"
"The applicant complains that he is a victim of a violation of Article 7 of the Convention, as well as Article 6.",non-argumentative,['company plain ']
The application was introduced on 31 March 1992 and registered on 19 June 1992.,non-argumentative,"['application be introduce march', 'application register june']"
On 12 October 1992 the Commission decided to communicate the application to the Government and to ask for written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.,non-argumentative,"['commission decide ', ' to municate application', ' to municate government', ' to ask observation']"
"The Government's observations were submitted on 29 January 1993 after one extension in the time-limit fixed for that purpose, and the applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 24 March 1993.",non-argumentative,"['observation be submit january', 'observation be submit extension', ' fix purpose', 'observation be submit march']"
"On 8 April 1993, the Commission granted the applicant legal aid.",non-argumentative,['commission grant aid']
"On 28 June 1993, the Commission decided to hold an oral hearing, consecutive to a hearing in the case of W. v. the United Kingdom (No. 20166/92).",non-argumentative,"['commission decide ', ' to hold hearing']"
"The European Commission of Human Rights sitting in private on 14 January 1994, the following members being present:",non-argumentative,['commission sit january']
The applicant complains that he has been convicted in respect of conduct which at the relevant time did not constitute a criminal offence.,non-argumentative,"['company plain ', 'he have be victe respect', 'company do stitute offence']"
"He invokes Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention, which provides as follows:",non-argumentative,"['he invoke art', 'which provide ']"
No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.,non-argumentative,"['one shall be hold guilty', 'one shall be hold account', 'which do stitute offence', 'which do stitute time', 'company do stitute offence', 'company do stitute time', 'it be mitte ']"
Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.,non-argumentative,"['penalty shall be impose one', 'offence be mitte ']"
"This Article (Art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.",non-argumentative,"[' prejudice trial', ' prejudice act', 'it be mitte ', ' accord principle', ' recognise nation']"
"By the relevant time, Hale's proposition that a wife's consent to sexual intercourse was irrevocable was no longer good law.",non-argumentative,['company send ']
English law did not therefore recognise any absolute immunity conferred on a husband who had sexual intercourse with a wife without her consent.,non-argumentative,"[' recognise immunity', 'company ferre husband', 'who have intercourse', 'who have wife', 'company send ']"
The applicant submits that his conviction for the attempted rape of his wife concerned conduct which did not at the relevant time constitute a criminal offence under United Kingdom law.,non-argumentative,"['applicant submit ', 'which do number time']"
No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.,non-argumentative,['ground have be establish ']
The Government's observations were not solicited on this point.,non-argumentative,['observation be solicit point']
Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention provides in its first sentence as follows:,non-argumentative,['6 provide sentence']
"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law...",non-argumentative,"['everyone be entitle hearing', ' establish law']"
The Commission recalls that the applicant complains that the courts erred in their construction of the 1976 Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act.,non-argumentative,"['commission recall ', ' err struction']"
It is not for the Commission to re-assess these factual elements of the case before the domestic courts.,non-argumentative,"['commission to re ', ' assess element']"
Insofar as it is alleged that as a result the applicant was wrongly convicted of an offence which did not exist at the relevant time it raises no separate issue under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.,non-argumentative,"['it be allege ', 'applicant be victe offence', 'which do exist time', 'it raise issue']"
