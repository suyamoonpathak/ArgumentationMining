"On 10 April 1989, before Lonrho's appeal in its unsuccessful judicial review application was before the House of Lords, Lord Keith of Kinkel raised the question whether the publication of the special edition and its posting to, inter alia, four members of the House of Lords who were due to hear Lonrho's appeal, was a contempt of court by Lonrho, Mr. Rowland or the editor of The Observer.",non-argumentative,"['keith raise question', ' to hear appeal']"
"Subsequently, the House of Lords held (<1989> 3 WLR 535) that the publication of the special edition did not in the circumstances create any risk that the course of justice in the appellate proceedings challenging the lawfulness of the Secretary of State's decision to defer the publication of the report would be impeded or prejudiced, and they dismissed the contempt proceedings.",non-argumentative,"['house hold ', ' create risk', ' challenge lawfulness', ' to defer publication', 'company would be impede ', 'company prejudice ', 'they dismiss proceeding']"
