There had in their contention not been any danger for them or their families.,argumentative,[]
"Moreover, the interrogation of the witnesses should in their contention not have taken place before the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['interrogation should have take place', 'interrogation should have take judge']"
"It would in their view have been feasible to have the police officers questioned in open court, wearing disguise if need be.",argumentative,"['officer question rt', ' wear disguise']"
"In addition, the applicants considered that they had not had sufficient opportunity to challenge and question the police officers.",argumentative,"['applicant sidere ', 'they have number', ' question officer']"
They drew attention to the conditions under which the interrogation of the anonymous witnesses had taken place.,argumentative,"['they draw attention', 'they draw dition', 'interrogation have take place']"
"The anonymous police officers had been confined in a room with the investigating judge, separated from the applicants and their lawyers; it had not been possible for the applicants or their lawyers to discover whether there had been any other person in that room or what was going on there.",argumentative,"['officer have be fine room', ' separate applicant', 'applicant to discover ', 'what be go ']"
Not all the questions asked by the defence had been answered.,argumentative,"[' ask defence', 'question have be answer ']"
"Finally, the applicants claimed that their conviction had been based ""to a decisive extent"" on the evidence given by anonymous witnesses.",argumentative,"['applicant claim ', 'viction have be base extent', 'viction have be base evidence', ' give witness']"
The only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal positively identifying the applicants had been that given by anonymous police officers.,argumentative,"[' rely court', ' identify applicant', ' give officer']"
"This was borne out by the fact that Mr Engelen, the one named witness who in the earlier stages of the proceedings had made statements incriminating one of the applicants, had not been granted anonymity and it had not been suggested that he had at any time been threatened.",argumentative,"['this be bear fact', 'who have make statement', ' incriminate one', 'engelen have be grant anonymity', 'it have be suggest ', 'he have be threaten ']"
The applicants questioned the need to maintain the anonymity of the police officers at all.,argumentative,"['applicant question need', ' to maintain anonymity']"
"In the Court’s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State.",argumentative,"[' maintain anonymity', 'balancing raise problem']"
"Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim.",argumentative,"['interest deserve protection', 'interest deserve convention', 'it must be recognise ']"
They owe a general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.,argumentative,"['they owe duty', 'they owe authority', 'they have link', 'they have reason', 'use should be resort circumstance']"
"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification.",argumentative,"['court can not find ', 'need provide justification']"
"In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court.",argumentative,"['duty may involve ', ' give evidence', ' give rt']"
"On the other hand, the Court has recognised in principle that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities, for his own or his family’s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see the above-mentioned Lüdi judgment, p. 21, para. 49).",argumentative,"['court have recognise principle', 'right be respect ', 'authority to wish ', ' to preserve anonymity', ' to preserve protection', ' deploy activity', ' to impair usefulness', ' see judgment']"
"Having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary.",argumentative,"[' have regard', 'right hold society', ' restrict right']"
If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.,argumentative,"['measure can suffice ', 'measure should be apply ']"
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",argumentative,"['defence be prevent ', ' observe demeanour', ' observe questioning', ' test reliability', ' see judgment']"
"It has not been explained to the Court’s satisfaction why it was necessary to resort to such extreme limitations on the right of the accused to have the evidence against them given in their presence, or why less far-reaching measures were not considered.",argumentative,"['it have be explain satisfaction', ' to resort limitation', 'evidence give presence']"
"In the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification.",argumentative,"['court can not find ', 'need provide justification']"
"In the present case, the police officers in question were in a separate room with the investigating judge, from which the accused and even their counsel were excluded.",argumentative,['accuse be exclude ']
All communication was via a sound link.,argumentative,[]
"The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).",argumentative,"['defence be prevent ', ' observe demeanour', ' observe questioning', ' test reliability', ' see judgment']"
It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993 (see paragraph 42 above) refers in this connection to the possibilities of using make-up or disguise and the prevention of eye contact.,argumentative,"['which become act', 'memorandum see paragraph', ' refer nection', ' refer possibility', ' use up']"
Nor is the Court persuaded that the Court of Appeal made sufficient effort to assess the threat of reprisals against the police officers or their families.,argumentative,"['court be persuade ', 'court make effort', ' to assess threat']"
It does not appear from that court’s judgment that it sought to address the question whether the applicants would have been in a position to carry out any such threats or to incite others to do so on their behalf.,argumentative,"['it do appear judgment', 'it seek ', ' to address question', ' to carry threat', ' to incite other', ' to do behalf']"
Its decision was based exclusively on the seriousness of the crimes committed,argumentative,"['decision be base seriousness', 'company mitte ']"
"In this connection, it is to be noted that Mr Engelen, a civilian witness who in the early stages of the proceedings had made statements identifying one of the applicants as one of the perpetrators, did not enjoy the protection of anonymity and it has not been claimed that he was at any time threatened.",argumentative,"['who have make statement', ' identify one', ' identify one', 'engelen do enjoy protection', 'it have be claim ', 'he be threaten ']"
"It is true - as noted by the Government and the Commission (see paragraph 48 above) - that the anonymous police officers were interrogated before an investigating judge, who had himself ascertained their identity and had, in a very detailed official report of his findings, stated his opinion on their reliability and credibility as well as their reasons for remaining anonymous.",argumentative,"['number e government', ' see paragraph', 'officer be interrogate judge', 'who have ascertain identity', 'who have state opinion']"
However these measures cannot be considered a proper substitute for the possibility of the defence to question the witnesses in their presence and make their own judgment as to their demeanour and reliability.,argumentative,"['measure can be not sidere ', 'defence to question witness', 'defence to question presence', 'defence make judgment']"
It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.,argumentative,"['it can be not say ', 'defence labour ', 'handicap be nterbalance procedure']"
It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.,argumentative,"['it can be not say ', 'defence labour ', 'handicap be nterbalance procedure']"
"Moreover, the only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal which provided positive identification of the applicants as the perpetrators of the crimes were the statements of the anonymous police officers.",argumentative,"[' rely court', 'which provide identification']"
"That being so the conviction of the applicants was based ""to a decisive extent"" on these anonymous statements.",argumentative,"['viction be base extent', 'viction be base statement']"
"In the Court’s view, the present case falls to be distinguished from that of Doorson: in the latter case it was decided on the basis of information contained in the case file itself that the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 - who were both civilians, and who knew the accused personally - had sufficient reason to believe that he might resort to violence, and they were heard in the presence of counsel (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, pp. 454-55, para. 25, pp. 455-56, para. 28, and pp. 470-71, paras. 71 and 73).",argumentative,"['case fall ', ' to be distinguish that', 'it be decide basis', 'company taine file', 'who know accuse', 'witness have reason', 'he might resort violence', 'they be hear presence', ' see judgment']"
"In addition, in the latter case other evidence providing positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crimes charged was available from sources unrelated to the anonymous witnesses (ibid., pp. 458-59, para. 34, and p. 472, para. 76).",argumentative,[' provide identification']
Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.,argumentative,"['court can not find ', ' take whole']"
This is a borderline case.,argumentative,[]
"On the one hand, the conditions in which the trial took place and the witnesses were examined were certainly not entirely satisfactory and no doubt they could have been improved, although it has to be acknowledged that efforts had been made in Netherlands law to adapt the procedure for hearing anonymous witnesses to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as set out in the judgment of Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, Series A no. 166).",argumentative,"['trial take place', 'witness be examine ', 'number doubt ', 'they ld have be improve ', 'it have ', 'effort have be make law', ' to adapt procedure', ' to adapt requirement', ' hear witness', ' set judgment']"
"On the other hand, this was a case of armed robbery and it is understandable that the witnesses - even though they were police officers - should be in fear of reprisals from trigger-happy criminals.",argumentative,[]
"Were a similar situation to arise in the future, it would certainly be desirable for even more attention to be paid to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) when measures were taken.",argumentative,"['situation to arise future', 'attention to be pay requirement', 'measure be take ']"
"In the instant case, however, having regard to all the circumstances, we are unable to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) and concur on the whole with the opinion of Judge van Dijk.",argumentative,"[' have regard', ' to find violation']"
"I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d)).",argumentative,"[' distinguish case', ' distinguish judgment', 'netherlands be find ', ' to have act violation', ' take para']"
"Even though the Court is not bound by precedent, legal certainty and legal equality require that the Court’s case-law be both consistent and transparent as well as reasonably predictable in so far as the facts of the case are comparable to those of earlier cases.",argumentative,"['court be bind precedent', 'certainty require ']"
"Since ""the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (see the previously cited Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67), the applicable national legislation and case-law and the practice followed by the domestic courts are to some extent relevant also for the Court.",argumentative,"['company to assess evidence', 'company to assess they', ' see judgment', ' follow rt']"
The Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment).,argumentative,"['court revise company', 'court revise view', ' cerne dition', 'viction may be base statement', ' see paragraph']"
"Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there).",argumentative,"[' take law', ' take point', ' base itself', ' base analysis', 'government propose ', 'legislature adopt amendment', 'government see paragraph']"
The Act of 1993 was not yet in force when the judgments of the domestic courts in the present case were given.,argumentative,['judgment be give ']
"However, had it been in force, the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal would have been in conformity with the rules thereby introduced.",argumentative,[' follow court']
"It is true that the reasons listed in the Act for keeping the identity of a witness secret do not include the desirability, for tactical reasons, of not disclosing the identity of a police officer in order not to impair his future effectiveness.",argumentative,"[' list act', ' keep identity', ' keep secret', 'reason do include desirability', ' disclose identity', ' to impair effectiveness']"
The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment).,argumentative,"['memorandum state word', ' investigate crime', 'interest can justify ', ' guarantee anonymity', ' see paragraph']"
"However, the Court of Appeal did not base its acceptance of the wish of the witnesses to remain anonymous on this reason, but on the fear of the witnesses for their lives and safety and those of their families (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment), which is a ground provided for in Article 226a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",argumentative,"['court do base acceptance', 'court do base reason', 'court see paragraph', ' provide article']"
"The foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention.",argumentative,['law will be find ']
"However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own.",argumentative,['law have relevance']
"Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law.",argumentative,"['law be take account', 'there would seem ', 'issue have be sidere law']"
"Consideration of the various issues involved ultimately led me to the conclusion that Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) have not been violated in the present case.",argumentative,"['consideration lead i', 'consideration lead clusion', 'd have be violate case', 'number have be violate case']"
"It might have been preferable for the Court of Appeal or the investigating judge to have interrogated the witnesses in the presence of counsel and the Procurator General, the accused being able to follow the proceedings in a separate room.",argumentative,"['court to have interrogate witness', 'court to have interrogate presence', ' to follow proceeding', ' to follow room']"
I cannot discover from the case file that was before the Court whether this possibility was considered at all.,argumentative,['i can not discover file']
"Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47).",argumentative,"[' take fact', ' take account', ' to examine witness', 'right be limit extent', 'defence be give opportunity', ' question witness', ' require para', ' see judgment']"

"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['i sider ', ' take account', ' pensate element', ' decide court', ' follow judge']"
In reaching this conclusion I would stress the following aspects:,argumentative,"[' reach clusion', 'i would stress aspect']"
"The anonymous witnesses were not interrogated only by a prosecuting authority, but also by an independent and impartial judge who, judging from his official report of his findings to the Court of Appeal, took great care to compensate the defence for the handicap resulting from the lack of a face-to-face confrontation.",argumentative,"['witness be interrogate authority', ' judge report', 'who take care', ' to pensate defence', ' result lack']"
The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own.,argumentative,"[' to hear interrogation', ' to ask question']"
"In these respects, as was also observed by the Commission, the present case differs from the cases of Kostovski (Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, para. 42), Windisch (Windisch v. Austria judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, p. 10, para. 27), Lüdi (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49), and Saïdi (Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, pp. 56-57, para. 44).",argumentative,"[' be observe commission', 'case differ case']"
"The practice in cases such as the present of having witnesses heard by an investigating judge instead of by the trial court itself was accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment as being in conformity with the Convention (loc. cit., p. 471, para. 73).",argumentative,"['witness hear judge', 'practice be accept court', 'practice be accept judgment']"
The Court of Appeal has given reasons for delegating the hearing of the witnesses to the investigating judge.,argumentative,"['court have give reason', ' delegate hearing', ' delegate judge']"
"The weight which the minority of the Commission laid on the fact that the Court of Appeal, being the trial court, did not avail itself of the possibility to assess for itself the reliability of the witnesses, is in my opinion not conclusive; there is no good reason why the court could not rely for this on the assessment of the equally independent and impartial investigating judge.",argumentative,"['minority lay fact', 'court do avail itself', 'court do avail possibility', ' to assess reliability', ' to assess itself', 'there be reason', 'number rely this', 'number rely assessment']"
"In that respect, it is also of relevance that the interrogations before the investigating judge did not take place in a pre-trial phase but during a suspension of the trial before the Court of Appeal and pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal; they formed part of the trial.",argumentative,"['interrogation do take place', 'interrogation do take phase', 'they form part']"
"In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43).",argumentative,"['court emphasise importance', 'judge to observe witness', 'one be hear judge']"
"The statements made before the investigating judge were statements by witnesses who had been identified by the investigating judge as having been, at the relevant moment, sworn police officers who were authorised to perform prosecuting duties invested with investigative competence and were under oath in relation to any statement made in that context (see the Lüdi judgment previously cited p. 21, para. 49).",argumentative,"[' make judge', 'who have be identify judge', 'who be authorise ', ' to perform duty', ' invest petence', ' make text', ' see judgment']"
"The investigating judge, who had observed the witnesses during the interrogations, gave a reasoned opinion as to their reliability; this was also intended to compensate the defence for being deprived of the visual information which would have permitted them to test the witnesses’ reliability (see the Windisch judgment previously cited, pp. 10-11, paras. 28-29).",argumentative,"['who have observe witness', 'who have observe interrogation', 'judge give opinion', 'this be intend ', ' to pensate defence', ' be deprive information', 'which would have permit they', ' to test reliability', ' see judgment']"
The investigating judge gave his reasoned opinion as to whether the wish of the police officers to remain anonymous was justified; these reasons were also found to be justified by the Court of Appeal on the grounds set out in its judgment.,argumentative,"['judge give opinion', 'wish be justify ', 'reason be find ', ' to be justify court', ' to be justify ground', ' set judgment']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['i sider ', ' take account', ' pensate element', ' decide court', ' follow judge']"
Their shared opinion that the accusations and events were such that fear of violent repercussions was not unsubstantiated cannot be considered unreasonable.,argumentative,[]
Article 6 (art. 6) does not guarantee an unlimited right to question witnesses.,argumentative,"['number do guarantee right', ' to question witness']"
"I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge.",argumentative,"['i sider ', ' take account', ' pensate element', ' decide court', ' follow judge']"
"It is necessary not only to recognise the discretion of the competent domestic court in maintaining conformity with the exigencies of the proper administration of justice, but also to balance the interests of the defence under Article 6 (art. 6) against the interests of witnesses protected by other substantive provisions of the Convention (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 70).",argumentative,"[' to recognise discretion', ' maintain formity', ' maintain exigency', ' to balance interest', ' to balance art', ' protect provision', ' see judgment']"
"Although in the Lüdi judgment (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49) the Court considered the interest of the police authorities in preserving the anonymity of their agents ""legitimate"", greater weight should be given in this case, as was done by the Court of Appeal, to the agents’ interest in the protection of their lives and safety and those of their families (Articles 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention) (art. 2, art. 3, art. 5, art. 8).",argumentative,"['company sidere interest', ' preserve anonymity', 'weight should be give case', ' be do court']"
"The defence were given ample opportunity to hear and question the witnesses, and to comment on the recording of their answers, and in fact made extensive use of that opportunity; the technical deficiencies complained of were inconvenient and might perhaps have been avoided, but, given especially the extensive time reserved for the hearings and the detailed way in which the statements were recorded, these deficiencies were not such as to hamper the defence to a significant extent.",argumentative,"['defence be give opportunity', ' question witness', 'defence make use', 'company plain ', 'deficiency might have be avoid ', ' give time', ' reserve hearing', 'statement be record ', ' to hamper defence', ' to hamper extent']"
"The Court of Appeal did not exclude beforehand the possibility that additional questions might be put to witnesses at the trial, but was of the opinion that the defence had insufficiently substantiated their wish to do so.",argumentative,"['court do exclude possibility', 'question might be put witness', 'question might be put trial', 'defence have substantiate wish']"
"Moreover, the defence were offered the possibility to challenge the statements and their use as evidence in open court before the Court of Appeal.",argumentative,"['defence be offer possibility', ' to challenge statement']"
The convictions were not based solely upon the statements of anonymous witnesses.,argumentative,[' base statement']
"Although these were undoubtedly the core of the evidence, there were also statements by identified witnesses, there was some technical evidence and there was the recording of the telephone conversation.",argumentative,"['there be statement', 'there be evidence', 'there be recording']"
"In this respect, too, the Court should recognise that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"".",argumentative,"['court should recognise ', ' to assess evidence']"
"In the Doorson judgment, in which the criterion of ""decisive extent"" was developed and applied (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), the Court found that this criterion had been met in a situation where the conviction was based, in addition to statements of anonymous witnesses, on a statement made by an identified witness to the police but retracted during the trial and a statement by an identified witness who disappeared before the defence had had the opportunity to question him (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76, in conjunction with pp. 458-59, para. 34).",argumentative,"['criterion be develop ', 'criterion apply ', 'court find ', 'criterion have be meet situation', 'viction be base addition', 'viction be base statement', ' make witness', ' retract trial', 'who disappear ', 'defence have have opportunity', ' to question he']"
"In view of all these aspects of the case I come to the conclusion that the trial which led to the applicants’ conviction was ""fair"" in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as construed in the Court’s previous case-law.",argumentative,"['which lead viction', ' strue law']"
"A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable.",argumentative,"['company may be sidere ', ' to judge plex', 'which should substitute judgment', 'which should substitute that']"
From the wording of the Doorson judgment it is clear that in that case the Court recognised this primary responsibility of the national court.,argumentative,['court recognise responsibility']
"The fact that police officers were fired at in pursuit does not necessarily mean that at a later stage, during or after the trial, their lives and safety and/or those of their families were in danger.",argumentative,"['officer be fire pursuit', 'fact do mean ']"
"However, on both points the national authorities - in this case the national courts - should be left some latitude to balance the interests of the defence against those of the witnesses (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 71, where a reasonableness test was applied).",argumentative,"['authority should be leave latitude', ' to balance interest', ' see judgment', 'test be apply ']"
In my opinion the Court of Appeal has not overstepped the mark in finding that the risk of disclosure of the identity of the witnesses was present and that their fear for their lives and safety or those of their families was justified in view of the seriousness of the crimes committed and the violence used.,argumentative,"['court have overstep mark', 'company mitte ']"
"In the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., pp. 470-71, para. 71) the Court found that an actual threat against the witnesses was not required for the decision to maintain their anonymity to be reasonable, and that previous experience might be relevant.",argumentative,"['court find ', 'threat be require ', ' to maintain anonymity']"
In the present case it should also be taken into consideration that some of the witnesses had been wounded while pursuing the robbers.,argumentative,"['it should be take sideration', 'some have be wound ', ' pursue robber']"
"Even if one were to take the position that a certain risk is implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve any less protection than that of other persons.",argumentative,"[' to take position', 'that should mean ', 'number should mean ', 'latter have ', ' to take risk', 'it do mean ', 'life deserve protection']"
"The ""general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities"" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection.",argumentative,"['duty see paragraph', ' owe policeman']"
"Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned.",argumentative,"['i can not agree majority', 'member be involve ', 'case have ', ' to be distinguish that']"
It cannot be denied - and indeed it has not been denied - that the possibilities for the defence to interrogate the witnesses were not without limitations.,argumentative,"['it can be not deny ', 'it have be deny ', 'defence to interrogate witness']"
"Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence.",argumentative,['identity be know defence']
The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise.,argumentative,"['question be answer witness', 'this be accept judge', 'this would have occur ', 'witness have be interrogate rt', 'witness have be interrogate form']"
"However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be ""decisive"" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).",argumentative,"['court state judgment', ' advance witness', ' claim anonymity', 'it sidere company', ' cerne safety', 'it see paragraph']"
"It may therefore be questioned whether it was necessary and proportionate to refuse to answer certain questions put by the defence in order to protect the anonymity of the witnesses and the secrecy of the police tactics. However, this question has to be answered primarily by the competent domestic court, and indeed it was answered in the affirmative by the investigating judge, and after his decision was challenged by the defence before the Court of Appeal, by the latter as well.",argumentative,"['it may be question ', ' to answer question', ' put defence', ' to protect anonymity', 'question have ', ' to be answer company', 'it be answer affirmative', 'it be answer judge', 'decision be challenge defence', 'decision be challenge court', 'decision be challenge latter']"

"The statements of the witnesses are however similar in all cases, since the hearings took place simultaneously in all five cases.",non-argumentative,"['hearing take place', 'hearing take case']"

"The statements were recorded in very great detail and in fact cover all the matters raised - also by the defence -, in a factual and where necessary even literal transcript.",non-argumentative,"['statement be record detail', 'statement be record defence', 'statement be record transcript']"
"And even if ... there are drawbacks to the manner in which the hearings of the unidentified witnesses were carried out, it is my belief that the advocate-general and the defence had sufficient opportunity to question the witnesses thoroughly at the hearings.",non-argumentative,"['there be drawback', 'hearing be carry ', 'general have opportunity', ' to question witness', ' to question hearing']"

I would now add the following:,non-argumentative,['i add follow']
All the ‘numbered witnesses’ made their identities known to me.,non-argumentative,"['witness make ', 'identity know i']"
It was clear to me that all eleven were different persons.,non-argumentative,[]
Their statements indicated such a knowledge of the facts that I am entirely convinced that I was talking to the witnesses referred to by numbers in the documents.,non-argumentative,"['statement indicate knowledge', 'i be vince ', 'i be talk witness', ' refer number']"
"On the contrary, each and every one of them was very much to the point.",non-argumentative,[]
The persons facing me wore serious expressions.,non-argumentative,"[' face i', 'person wear expression']"
"The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake, especially for the accused persons involved.",non-argumentative,['they have give ']
"The calm, quiet manner in which, for example, BRZ03 and BRZ08 related their experiences in Leende (in which connection I expressly leave it to the Court of Appeal to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused.",non-argumentative,"['brz03 relate experience', 'i leave it', 'i leave court', 'manner give indication']"
"All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness, which, in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [two of the defence lawyers] in particular, did not bother me.",non-argumentative,"['witness manifest degree', 'which do bother i']"
"If all the statements are laid side by side, some differences of detail can be observed.",non-argumentative,"['statement be lay ', 'difference can be observe ']"
I do not think that these differences are such as to warrant the conclusion that the witnesses may be unreliable.,non-argumentative,"['i do think ', ' to warrant clusion']"
"Rather, in so far as I have observed any differences, I would describe them rather as the ‘extraneous noise’ which in my experience practically always affects statements by witnesses.",non-argumentative,"['i have observe difference', 'i would describe they', 'i would describe number', 'which affect statement']"
Of course it is ultimately for the Court of Appeal to decide on the value of the statements.,non-argumentative,['court to decide value']
The reasons for the witnesses wishing to remain anonymous in the instant case are given in the records of the hearings.,non-argumentative,"['witness wish ', ' to remain case', 'reason be give record']"
It seems to me that I am now affording the Court an opportunity to reflect on the value of those arguments.,non-argumentative,"['it seem i', ' afford opportunity', ' to reflect value']"
"I think that the text of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands also compels me, as the judge conducting the questioning, to state my opinion on the reasons given by the witnesses for remaining anonymous.",non-argumentative,"['i think ', 'text pel i', 'text pel company', ' ducte questioning', ' to state opinion', ' give witness']"
I am also concerned to inform the Court of Appeal that I am aware that the Court is called to take the final decision in these matters.,non-argumentative,"[' to inform court', 'court be call ', ' to take decision']"
I consider the reasons behind the desire to remain anonymous to be such as fully to justify anonymity.,non-argumentative,[' to justify anonymity']
I have had regard in this connection to the nature of these cases and to the nature of the activities of the anonymous witnesses concerned.,non-argumentative,"['i have have regard', 'i have have company', 'i have have nection']"
I take the liberty of observing - while expressly leaving aside the question whether these accused persons are the perpetrators - that the instant case tellingly illustrates the fact that there are evidently people for whom human lives do not count when it comes to evading responsibility for exceptionally serious crimes which they may have committed.,non-argumentative,"['i take liberty', ' leave question', 'case illustrate fact', 'there be people', 'life do number nt', 'it e ', ' evade responsibility', 'they may have mitte ']"
"I can understand that there are major objections to revealing the names and appearance of members of arresting teams, observation teams and arresting units to the public at large.",non-argumentative,"['i can understand ', 'there be objection', ' reveal name', ' reveal public']"
By that I mean that the obvious interest of society in having very serious crimes solved should weigh in the balance.,non-argumentative,"['i mean ', 'crime solve ', 'interest should weigh balance']"
"At the same time, I am of the opinion that the conduct of the unidentified witnesses (who are no longer anonymous to myself) who have appeared in this case is the subject of proper judicial supervision.",non-argumentative,['who have appear case']
It is not apparent to me as investigating judge that the ‘numbered witnesses’ acted carelessly.,non-argumentative,['witness act ']
"Rather, in my opinion, the opposite was true.",non-argumentative,[]
"During the last hearing of the witness Koene, [two of the defence lawyers] asked me to record that, in their view, the witness answered not only the questions of the defence but also questions by the investigating judge in a ponderous, deliberate manner that was hard to follow.",non-argumentative,"['two ask i', 'witness answer question', 'witness answer manner']"
I have been asked to endorse that opinion.,non-argumentative,"['i have be ask ', ' to endorse opinion']"

"Accordingly, the Court has recognised that in such cases Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d) requires that the handicaps under which the defence labours be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (ibid., p. 471, para. 72).",non-argumentative,"['court have recognise ', ' take para', 'd require ', 'handicap be nterbalance procedure', ' follow authority']"

dissenting opinion of Mr van Dijk.,non-argumentative,[]
To my regret I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 in conjunction with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d). Nor can I follow the majority as regards the essence of the reasoning supporting that conclusion.,non-argumentative,"[' to agree clusion', 'i can follow majority', ' regard essence', ' support clusion']"
"Although the Court’s case-law has not yet been fully developed as to the conditions subject to which a conviction in criminal proceedings may be based partly on statements of anonymous witnesses, the Court has drawn certain lines.",non-argumentative,"['law have be develop ', 'number have be develop ', 'viction may be base statement', 'court have draw line']"
"Having stated my conclusion I wish, with due respect, to make the following observations with regard to the reasoning on which the majority bases its conclusion.",non-argumentative,"[' having state clusion', 'i wish respect', ' to make observation', 'majority base clusion']"
"Like the majority, and in accordance with the case-law of the Court, I take as my starting-point that evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing.",non-argumentative,"['i take point', 'evidence must be produce hearing']"
"Therefore, I find in the abstract that interrogation of the police officers at the trial before the Court of Appeal, in disguise if necessary to protect their anonymity, would have been preferable.",non-argumentative,"['i find abstract', ' to protect anonymity']"
"However, I also take note of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that this would have been too risky because disclosure of the identity of the witnesses could not have been excluded.",non-argumentative,"['i take number', 'disclosure have be exclude ']"
I would have preferred it if the Court of Appeal had given concrete arguments for that opinion.,non-argumentative,"['i would have prefer it', 'court have give argument']"
"On the other hand, I lack the expertise - as, I assume, do my colleagues in the Court - to judge whether its fear was justified or not.",non-argumentative,"['i lack expertise', 'i assume ', 'fear be justify ']"
"Then again, one may well wonder whether the defence would have been in a better position to observe the witnesses’ demeanour and test their reliability had they appeared in disguise, given the fact that an effective disguise may also substantially disguise the sound and intonation of the voice and the body language of the person concerned.",non-argumentative,"['one may wonder ', ' to observe demeanour', ' test reliability', 'they have appear disguise', ' give fact', 'disguise may disguise sound']"
I disagree with the majority that the Court of Appeal failed to make any real effort to assess the threat of reprisals.,non-argumentative,"['i disagree majority', 'court fail ', ' to make effort', ' to assess threat']"
"The Court of Appeal had at its disposal the report of findings of the investigating judge, in which the latter referred not only to the statements made on this subject by the police officers concerned - which were in some cases supported by previous experience (paragraphs 17 and 21 of the judgment) - but also gave his own evaluation, based upon the seriousness of the crimes and the violence used by the perpetrators.",non-argumentative,"['court have report', 'court have disposal', 'latter refer number', 'latter refer statement', ' make subject', ' make company', 'which be support paragraph', 'court give evaluation', ' base seriousness', ' use perpetrator']"
"Given these reasoned opinions of both the investigating judge and the Court of Appeal, the latter of which was reviewed by the Supreme Court, the Government were not called upon to give an explanation of their own, as held by the majority (see paragraph 60 of the judgment); nor in my opinion would the Government have been in a position to do so.",non-argumentative,"[' give opinion', 'latter be review court', 'government be call ', ' to give explanation', ' hold majority', ' see paragraph']"
"The fact that Mr Engelen, who had originally made a highly incriminating statement, was not granted anonymity by the police and nevertheless did not suffer any harm at the hands of the applicants cannot be decisive in this context.",non-argumentative,"['who have make statement', 'engelen be grant anonymity', 'engelen be grant police', 'engelen do suffer harm', 'engelen do suffer hand']"
"The police may have made a mistake in his case by revealing his identity, but in any case later events do not automatically and retrospectively invalidate a reasonable assessment of a risk.",non-argumentative,"['police may have make mistake', 'police may have make case', ' reveal identity', 'event do number ', ' invalidate assessment']"
One can hardly blame a witness who expresses serious fears for not waiting until something serious happens to him or any other witness; the only criterion for the national court to consider is the reasonableness of the fear.,non-argumentative,"['one can blame witness', 'who express fear', 'something happen he']"
I fail to see why policemen should be under a special duty to give evidence in open court (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) since this is a general civic duty prescribed by law.,non-argumentative,"['i fail ', ' to give evidence', ' to give company', ' see paragraph', ' prescribe law']"
"And even if one may agree that the use of policemen as anonymous witnesses ""should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances"" (ibid.), one may argue on the other hand that their anonymity should meet with fewer objections from the point of view of the defence, because their statements are statements by sworn professionals, whose identity and investigative competence can easily be checked by the investigating judge.",non-argumentative,"['one may agree ', 'use should be resort circumstance', 'one may argue hand', 'anonymity should meet objection', 'identity can be check judge']"
"The majority also deal with the question whether ""operational needs"" provided sufficient justification for preserving the anonymity of the police officers.",non-argumentative,"['majority deal question', 'need provide justification', ' preserve anonymity']"

"On the whole, in my opinion, neither the limitations necessitated by the situation nor those accepted by the investigating judge were such as to warrant the finding that there was no ""adequate and proper opportunity to question the witnesses"" as required by the Court in its Kostovski judgment (loc. cit., p. 20, para. 41).",non-argumentative,"[' necessitate situation', ' accept judge', ' to warrant finding', 'there be opportunity', ' to question witness', ' require court', ' require loc']"
"The handicaps under which the defence laboured were, therefore, sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the Kostovski judgment previously cited, p. 21, para. 43, and the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 472, para. 76).",non-argumentative,"['defence labour ', 'handicap be nterbalance procedure', ' follow authority', ' see judgment']"
"Finally, although the statements of the anonymous witnesses were an essential part of the evidence, it cannot be said that the convictions were based solely on these statements.",non-argumentative,"['it can be not say ', 'viction be base statement']"
"Whether they were based on these statements ""to a decisive extent"", as the majority holds (paragraph 63 of the judgment), is hard to say.",non-argumentative,"['they be base statement', 'they be base extent', 'majority hold paragraph']"
"I share the opinion expressed by the Delegate of the Commission at the Court’s hearing that this criterion, laid down in the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), is difficult to apply, because if the testimony of anonymous witnesses is used by the court as part of the evidence, that will always be because the court considers it a ""decisive"" part of that evidence, making the proof complete or at least sufficient.",non-argumentative,"['i share opinion', ' express delegate', ' lay loc', 'testimony be use rt', 'testimony be use part', 'company sider ']"
"Here again, the Court’s finding that ""as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them"" (paragraph 50 of the present judgment) should prevail.",non-argumentative,"['courts find ', ' to assess evidence']"
