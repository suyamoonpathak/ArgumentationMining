"(see the Artico v. Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 12-13, paras. 24 and 27).",argumentative,[' see judgment']
The Court therefore has jurisdiction to entertain it,argumentative,"['court have jurisdiction', ' to entertain it']"
not having applied for judicial review either of the Inspectors’ conduct of the inquiry or of their decision to submit their report to the Secretary of State;,argumentative,"[' having not apply review', ' having not apply duct', ' to submit report', ' to submit secretary']"
by not having applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision to publish the Inspectors’ report;,argumentative,"[' having apply review', ' to publish report']"
by not having pursued the libel proceedings commenced against The Observer newspaper.,argumentative,"[' having pursue proceeding', 'company mence newspaper']"
"According to the Government, the applicants failed to exhaust their domestic remedies",argumentative,"[' accord government', 'applicant fail ', ' to exhaust remedy']"
"The grounds on which judicial review may be sought (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) are such that it would not have ensured access to a court for determination of the truth of statements made about the applicants in the Inspectors’ report, the absence of such access being the essence of their complaints under the Convention.",argumentative,"['review may be seek ', 'ground see paragraph', 'it would have ensure access', ' make applicant', ' make report']"
"Nor would the libel actions against The Observer, although to some extent concerned with the same subject-matter (see paragraph 11 above), have provided a remedy against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State as regards the publication of the damaging statements contained in the Inspectors’ report.",argumentative,"[' cerne matter', 'action would see paragraph', 'company would see paragraph', ' have provide remedy', ' regard publication', 'company taine report']"
The Court therefore agrees with the Delegate of the Commission and the applicants that the plea of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been made out by the Government.,argumentative,"['court agree delegate', 'plea have be make government']"
"The applicants contended that the Inspectors’ investigation and, above all, the publication of the Inspectors’ report gave rise to a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which, in so far as relevant, provides:",argumentative,"['company tend ', 'investigation give rise', 'investigation give violation', 'which provide ']"
"In their submission, the making and the subsequent publication of the Inspectors’ report in its entirety seriously damaged their reputations, thereby determining their civil right to honour and reputation, and the state of English law was such that they were denied effective access to the courts to challenge the resultant interference with that civil right.",argumentative,"['making damage reputation', ' determine right', 'they be deny access', ' to challenge interference']"
"The first stage of the applicants’ argument, which was disputed by the Government and not accepted by the Commission, was that",argumentative,"['which be dispute government', 'which accept commission']"
Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was applicable to the investigation by the Inspectors.,argumentative,[]
"In order for an individual to be entitled to a hearing before a tribunal, there must exist a ""dispute"" (""contestation"") over one of his or her civil rights or obligations.",argumentative,"['individual to be entitle hearing', 'there must exist testation']"
"It follows, so the Court’s case-law has explained, that the result of the proceedings in question must be directly decisive for such a right or obligation, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) into play",argumentative,"['it follow ', 'law have explain ', ' to bring para']"
"(see, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 20-22, paras. 44-50).",argumentative,[' see judgment']
"It follows, so the Court’s case-law has explained, that the result of the proceedings in question must be directly decisive for such a right or obligation, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) into play",argumentative,"['it follow ', 'law have explain ', ' to bring para']"
"the respondent Government did not dispute the existence and ""civil"" character of the right under English law to a good reputation.",argumentative,['government do dispute existence']
"The principal purpose of the investigation and report of the Inspectors, they maintained, was to acquire, marshal and set down factual information which would enable the various competent authorities - such as the Director General of Fair Trading, the prosecuting authorities, the Bank of England, the Takeover Panel and the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 23, 27, 30 and 34 above) - to decide what action, if any, to take.",argumentative,"['they maintain ', ' set information', 'which would enable ', 'authority see paragraph']"
"Four further purposes also existed, none of which, however, included ascertaining whether the applicants merited their good reputation. These additional purposes were dispelling public speculation about the events surrounding the takeover, enabling those concerned in takeovers to learn lessons, laying the foundations for reform of company law and practice, and providing information to HOF’s employees, shareholders and creditors.",argumentative,"['purpose exist ', 'number include ', 'applicant merit reputation', 'purpose be dispel speculation', ' surround takeover', 'purpose enable company', ' to learn lesson', ' lay foundation', ' provide information', ' provide employee']"
"However, they submitted that neither the investigation by the Inspectors nor the publication of the report ""determined"" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation or, indeed, any right at all.",argumentative,"['they submit ', 'investigation determine right']"
"The Commission, after analysing the purposes served by the preparation and publication of the Inspectors’ report, came to the conclusion that the Inspectors had an ""investigative rather than determinative"" role (paragraph 64 of the Commission’s report).",argumentative,"[' analyse purpose', ' serve preparation', 'commission come clusion']"
The Commission was therefore of the opinion that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was not applicable to the proceedings conducted by Inspectors because those proceedings did not determine any civil right or obligation of the applicants.,argumentative,"[' ducte inspector', 'proceeding do determine right']"
The Court notes that under the terms of section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 Inspectors can only be appointed if it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more types of specified wrongdoing or unlawful action in the conduct of a company’s affairs (see paragraph 36 above).,argumentative,"['number e ', 'inspector can be appoint ', 'it appear secretary', 'there be circumstance', ' suggest type', ' see paragraph']"
"The Act confers on the Inspectors wide powers to obtain information and obstruction of the Inspectors may, upon reference by them to a court, be treated by it as a contempt of court and punished accordingly (sections 434 and 436 of the Act - see paragraph 38 above).",argumentative,"['company fer power', 'company fer inspector', ' to obtain information', 'fer may be treat it', 'fer may be treat tempt', 'fer punish section', ' see paragraph']"
"The principal question addressed by the Inspectors in the instant case can be reduced to whether the Fayed brothers had dishonestly misled the authorities and the public in order to obtain Government clearance and acceptance by the HOF Board of their bid (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). The Inspectors’ published findings - that the applicants had indeed made dishonest representations concerning their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources and had thereafter knowingly submitted false evidence to the Inspectors (see paragraph 22 above) - undoubtedly damaged the applicants’ reputations.",argumentative,"[' address inspector', ' address case', 'question can be reduce ', 'brother have mislead authority', ' to obtain clearance', ' see paragraph', 'inspector publish ', 'applicant have make representation', ' cerne origin', 'applicant have submit evidence', 'applicant have submit inspector', ' see paragraph', 'finding damage reputation']"
"The competent Ministers and a Parliamentary Select Committee - quite apart, it can be supposed, from a substantial section of public opinion - showed a disposition to accept as correct these findings, publication of which was seen as a kind of sanction (see paragraphs 26, 30, 31, 33 and 34 above). Such elements or consequences are, it is true, not infrequently found in the context of adjudicatory proceedings.",argumentative,"['it can be suppose ', 'ministers show disposition', ' to accept finding', ' to accept rect', 'publication be see kind', ' see paragraph', 'element be find text']"
"However, the Court is satisfied that the functions performed by the Inspectors were, in practice as well as in theory, essentially investigative",argumentative,[' perform inspector']
"The Inspectors did not adjudicate, either in form or in substance.",argumentative,['inspector do adjudicate form']
(see the similar analysis by the Supreme Court of the United States of America of the function of the Federal Civil Rights Commission in the case of Hannah v. Larche (363 US 420 (1960)).,argumentative,[' see analysis']
"However, the Court is satisfied that the functions performed by the Inspectors were, in practice as well as in theory, essentially investigative",argumentative,[' perform inspector']
They themselves said in their report that their findings would not be dispositive of anything (see paragraph 21 above).,argumentative,"['they say report', ' see paragraph']"
"They did not make a legal determination as to criminal or civil liability concerning the Fayed brothers, and in particular concerning the latter’s civil right to honour and reputation.",argumentative,"['they do make determination', 'company cerne brother', 'company cerne right']"
"The purpose of their inquiry was to ascertain and record facts which might subsequently be used as the basis for action by other competent authorities - prosecuting, regulatory, disciplinary or even legislative.",argumentative,"[' record fact', 'which might be use basis']"
"Lonrho admittedly exhibited a clear interest in the inquiry and its outcome, by being instrumental in bringing about the appointment of the Inspectors, by submitting evidence and by seeking to prompt action by the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 12 in fine, 13, 19, 24, 25 and 35 above).",argumentative,"['lonrho exhibit interest', ' bring appointment', ' submit evidence', ' to prompt action', ' see paragraph']"
"Nonetheless, whilst there was a close connection between Lonrho’s grievance against the Fayed brothers and the matters investigated by the Inspectors (see, inter alia, paragraphs 10-13 and 22 above), the object of the proceedings before the Inspectors was not to resolve any dispute (contestation) between Lonrho and the applicants.",argumentative,"['there be nection', ' investigate inspector', ' see paragraph', ' to resolve testation']"
"Those disputes, and in particular the applicants’ libel claims that Lonrho, through The Observer, had wrongfully damaged their reputations, were being adjudicated by the ordinary courts (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above).",argumentative,"['lonrho have damage reputation', 'dispute be be adjudicate company', ' see paragraph']"
"Likewise, no dispute (contestation) between the Secretary of State or the Inspectors and the applicants as to the lawfulness of any alleged interference with the applicants’ right to reputation arose merely because the applicants contested the grounds on which the Minister decided to appoint the Inspectors and on which the Inspectors conducted their lines of inquiry.",argumentative,"['testation arise ', 'company test ground', 'minister decide ', ' to appoint inspector', 'company ducte line']"
"The Inspectors described Lonrho and the Fayed brothers as ""bitterly antagonistic parties"" (see paragraph 19 in fine above).",argumentative,"['inspector describe lonrho', 'inspector describe party', ' see paragraph']"
"In short, it cannot be said that the Inspectors’ inquiry ""determined"" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation, for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or that its result was directly decisive for that right.",argumentative,"['it can be not say ', 'inquiry determine right', 'inquiry determine purpose']"
"In short, it cannot be said that the Inspectors’ inquiry ""determined"" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation, for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or that its result was directly decisive for that right.",argumentative,"['it can be not say ', 'inquiry determine right', 'inquiry determine purpose']"
Acceptance of the applicants’ argument would entail that a body carrying out preparatory investigations at the instance of regulatory or other authorities should always be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure set forth in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) by reason of the fact that publication of its findings is liable to damage the reputation of the individuals whose conduct is being investigated.,argumentative,"['acceptance would entail ', ' carry investigation', ' carry instance', ' set para', ' to damage reputation', 'duct be be investigate ']"
Such an interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities.,argumentative,[' would hamper regulation']
"The Inspectors did not adjudicate, either in form or in substance.",argumentative,['inspector do adjudicate form']
Such an interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities.,argumentative,[' would hamper regulation']
The Court accordingly concludes that the investigation by the Inspectors was not such as to attract the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).,argumentative,"['court clude ', 'company clude ', ' to attract application']"
"In the words of the Court’s Golder judgment, ""... Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal.",argumentative,"[' secure right', ' secure everyone', ' relate right', 'claim bring rt']"
"In this way the Article (art. 6-1) embodies the ‘right to a court’, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only"" (loc. cit., p. 18, para. 36).",argumentative,"['6 embody right', ' to institute proceeding', ' to institute rt', ' to institute matter', 'right stitute aspect']"
"This right to a court ""extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law;",argumentative,"['right extend dispute', 'which can be say ground', ' to be recognise law']"
It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.,argumentative,"['limitation do restrict ', 'limitation reduce access', ' leave way', 'essence be impair ']"
"In the Government’s submission, the defence of privilege delimited the very content of the applicants’ right to a good reputation as protected under English law.",argumentative,"['defence delimit tent', 'defence delimit right', ' protect law']"
"They maintained that, unlike procedural barriers to access to court, such an exercise by the State of the power to fix the content of a particular civil right did not bring into play Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), although it might on occasions raise an issue in relation to one or other of the substantive rights protected by the Convention (such as the right to respect for private life under Article 8) (art. 8).",argumentative,"['they maintain ', ' to fix tent', 'exercise do bring para', 'exercise do bring play', 'number do bring para', 'number do bring play', 'it might raise issue', ' protect convention', ' to respect life']"
"In the circumstances, they concluded, the applicants had no actionable claim to a civil right under English law so as to attract the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",argumentative,"['they clude ', 'company clude ', 'applicant have claim', ' to attract application']"
It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law.,argumentative,[' to trace line']
It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy.,argumentative,['limitation be express term']
"The Commission and the applicants, on the other hand, considered that the defence amounted to a limitation on the right to bring defamation proceedings and, as such, a restriction on effective access to court.",argumentative,"['commission sidere ', 'company sidere ', 'defence amount limitation', ' to bring proceeding']"
"If the Court were to treat the facts underlying the complaints declared admissible by the Commission as raising a substantive, rather than a procedural, complaint going to the right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention - as it has jurisdiction to do",argumentative,"[' to treat fact', ' underlie plaint', ' declare admissible', ' declare commission', ' raise plaint', ' go right', ' to respect life', 'it have jurisdiction']"
"The Court therefore proposes to proceed on the basis that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable to the facts of the case, the argument before the Court having been directed solely to this Article.",argumentative,"['court propose ', ' to proceed basis', 'argument having be direct article']"
"On this approach, it has to be ascertained whether the contested limitation on the applicants’ ability to take legal proceedings to challenge the findings and conclusions in the Inspectors’ report which were damaging to their reputations satisfied the conditions stated in the Court’s case-law.",argumentative,"['it have ', 'company test limitation', ' to take proceeding', ' to challenge finding', 'which be damage reputation', ' satisfy dition', ' state law']"
"In the present case the Court does not consider it necessary to settle the question of the precise nature of the defence of privilege for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), since it is devoid of significance in the particular circumstances.",argumentative,"['court do sider ', 'company do sider ', ' to settle question', ' to settle purpose']"
"(see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, pp. 19-20, para. 41)",argumentative,[' see judgment']
"If the Court were to treat the facts underlying the complaints declared admissible by the Commission as raising a substantive, rather than a procedural, complaint going to the right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention - as it has jurisdiction to do",argumentative,"[' to treat fact', ' underlie plaint', ' declare admissible', ' declare commission', ' raise plaint', ' go right', ' to respect life', 'it have jurisdiction']"
"The legitimacy of the limitation complained of cannot be divorced from its context, namely the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985.",argumentative,"['company plain ', 'legitimacy can be not divorce text']"
The underlying aim of this system is clearly the furtherance of the public interest in the proper conduct of the affairs of public companies whose owners benefit from limited liability.,argumentative,['owner benefit liability']
"Considerations of public interest dictate both the appointment of Inspectors and the publication or not of their report (see paragraphs 36, 40 and 41 above).",argumentative,"['consideration dictate appointment', 'dictate see paragraph']"
"The system contributes to safeguarding the interests of the various parties concerned in the affairs of public companies such as investors, shareholders, especially small shareholders, creditors, customers, trading partners and employees, as well as ensuring the overall soundness and credibility of the country’s company law structures.",argumentative,"['company tribute ', ' safeguard interest', ' ensure soundness']"
"In the words of the Commission’s report (at paragraph 64), ""it is ... necessary in a democratic society that governments exercise supervisory controls over large commercial activities in order to ensure good management practices and the transparency of honest dealings"".",argumentative,"['government exercise trol', 'government exercise activity', ' to ensure practice']"
"As regards the particular facts complained of by the applicant brothers, the Court accepts as accurate the Government’s analysis of the purposes served by the making and publication of the Inspectors’ report (see paragraphs 28 and 58 above - see also paragraphs 13, 14 and 30 above as regards the particular facts).",argumentative,"[' regard fact', ' plain brother', 'court accept analysis', ' serve making', 'court see paragraph', ' see paragraph', ' regard fact']"
The investigation into the affairs of HOFH and the publication of the resultant report in themselves therefore pursued legitimate aims.,argumentative,['investigation pursue aim']
The investigation into the affairs of HOFH and the publication of the resultant report in themselves therefore pursued legitimate aims.,argumentative,['investigation pursue aim']
"As to the contested limitation on the ability to take legal proceedings, it was common ground that any defamation action brought by the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State would have been successfully met with a defence of privilege, be it absolute or qualified (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above).",argumentative,"[' to take proceeding', ' bring applicant', ' bring inspector', 'action would have be meet defence', ' see paragraph']"
The rationale of this defence is that statements which harm an individual’s reputation and which would otherwise give rise to liability should benefit from total or partial immunity because their author or publisher is acting in furtherance of some overriding interest of social importance (see paragraph 42 above).,argumentative,"['which harm reputation', 'which would give rise', 'which would give liability', 'statement should benefit immunity', 'author be act furtherance', ' see paragraph']"
"As regards more specifically investigations under the Companies Act, the British courts have explained that ""the public interest demands"" that ""Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness"" (per Lord Denning in re Pergamon Press Ltd - see paragraph 43 above).",argumentative,"[' regard investigation', 'rt have explain ', 'interest demand ', 'inspector should make report', 'inspector should make rage', 'inspector should make denning', ' see paragraph']"
"Like the Commission, the Court has no difficulty in accepting that the underlying objective in according Inspectors freedom to report in this manner is likewise legitimate.",argumentative,"['court have difficulty', ' accord freedom', ' to report manner']"
"Whilst continuing to maintain that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued, they stressed that their complaint was not directed against the defence of privilege as such. They were not asserting a right to hold the Inspectors or the Secretary of State personally liable for damages in a suit for defamation; nor were they arguing that such independent reports into the affairs of public companies should never be prepared or published.",argumentative,"['company tinue ', 'they stress ', ' direct defence', 'they be assert right', 'they be assert suit', 'they be argue ', 'report should be never prepare ', 'report publish ']"
"Rather their claim was that where a report by organs of the State has branded an individual as being guilty of wrongdoing such as dishonesty after a procedure not attended by the procedural guarantees of a fair trial, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) grants the individual whose reputation is at stake the right to challenge the findings against him or her in a court of law before publication of the report.",argumentative,"['report have brand individual', ' attend guarantee', '6 grant right', ' to challenge finding', ' to challenge rt', ' to challenge publication']"
"Accepting that a cause of action based on libel was barred and that judicial review did not provide the desired remedy, some other form of effective access to the courts should have been available to them for this purpose by virtue of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",argumentative,"[' base libel', 'cause be bar ', 'review do provide remedy']"
"The English legal system, in their view, lacked adequate safeguards to protect their civil right to honour and reputation against misuse of their powers by the Inspectors and the Secretary of State.",argumentative,"['system lack safeguard', ' to protect right', ' to protect misuse']"
They submitted that means which involved denying them any effective remedy at all for the attack on their reputations caused disproportionate harm to them.,argumentative,"['they submit means', 'which involve ', ' deny remedy', ' deny attack', ' cause harm']"
"As to enforcement of the right to a good reputation under domestic law, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to businessmen",argumentative,[]
"Persons, such as the applicants, who fall into the former category of businessmen inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts, not only by the press but also and above all by bodies representing the public interest (ibid.).",argumentative,"['who fall category', 'person lay themselves', 'person lay open', ' represent interest']"
The contested limitation was thus concerned with an investigation of circumstances offered to public scrutiny by persons who had themselves sought a public profile through their bid to take over a large public company.,argumentative,"[' cerne investigation', ' offer person', 'who have seek profile', 'who have seek bid', ' to take pany']"
"(see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 26, para. 59)",argumentative,[' see judgment']
"As to enforcement of the right to a good reputation under domestic law, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to businessmen",argumentative,[]
"An additional point to note as concerns the particular circumstances of the present case is that the findings in the Inspectors’ report to which the applicants took exception related to matters which the applicants themselves had made great efforts to bring into the public domain, namely their family background, their personal wealth and their business activities (see paragraphs 9 and 22 above).",argumentative,"['applicant take exception', 'finding relate matter', 'applicant have make effort', ' to bring domain', ' see paragraph']"
"The beneficial public reputation which the applicants enjoyed in late 1984 and early 1985 was largely the result of an active public relations campaign which they undertook with the assistance of their advisers, and it played a crucial role in facilitating clearance of their bid for HOF.",argumentative,"['applicant enjoy 1984', 'they undertake assistance', 'it play role', ' facilitate clearance']"
"Thereafter the applicants were at pains to stifle any publicity adverse to this favourable reputation which they had themselves largely created, as is shown by their threatened or actual libel actions against various newspapers, notably The Observer (see paragraph 11 above).",argumentative,"[' to stifle publicity', 'they have create ', ' be show action', ' see paragraph']"
The contested limitation was thus concerned with an investigation of circumstances offered to public scrutiny by persons who had themselves sought a public profile through their bid to take over a large public company.,argumentative,"[' cerne investigation', ' offer person', 'who have seek profile', 'who have seek bid', ' to take pany']"
"In any event, in their argument to the Court the applicants did not suggest that either the Inspectors or the successive Secretaries of State had acted with malicious intent, which would have destroyed a defence of qualified privilege.",argumentative,"['applicant do suggest ', 'inspectors have act intent', 'which would have destroy defence']"
"In arriving at their findings of fact or conclusions, the Inspectors were under a duty to act fairly and to give anyone whom they proposed to criticise in their report a fair opportunity to answer the allegations against them.",argumentative,"[' arrive finding', ' to give opportunity', 'they propose ', ' to criticise report', ' to answer allegation']"
"Although the investigation was administrative and not judicial in nature, the Inspectors were bound by what are known under English law as ""the rules of natural justice"" (see paragraph 39 above).",argumentative,"['inspector be bind ', 'what be know law', 'what be know rule', ' see paragraph']"
"The remedy of judicial review was available to the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State to challenge the appointment of the Inspectors, the making of the report, its content or its publication if it could be claimed that there had been unfairness or breach of the rules of natural justice or that the findings or conclusions were unreliable on a number of other grounds (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above).",argumentative,"[' to challenge appointment', 'it ld be claim ', 'it see paragraph']"
"In the latter connection, judicial review would have provided relief if it could have been established that the Inspectors had made findings of fact not properly based on material with probative value, or reached conclusions which there were no facts to support, or taken into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take account of relevant considerations, or reached conclusions which no reasonable person in their position could have reached (ibid.).",argumentative,"['review would have provide relief', 'it have be establish ', 'inspector have make finding', ' base material', 'inspector reach clusion', 'there be fact', ' take sideration', ' take account', ' to take account', ' reach clusion', 'ld have reach ibid']"
"Judicial review would not, it is true, have provided the applicants with ""the effective remedy"" to which they were claiming to be entitled under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), namely a remedy enabling them to argue before a court that the Inspectors’ findings of fact were simply erroneous.",argumentative,"['review would number have provide applicant', 'review would number have provide remedy', 'they be claim ', ' to be entitle para', ' enable they', ' to argue company', ' to argue rt']"
"Nonetheless, the manner in which findings detrimental to a person’s reputation are arrived at in an administrative investigation, as well as the objectives pursued by the investigation, is relevant for assessing the permissibility under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of a limitation on the person’s opportunities to go to court to enforce his or her civil right to reputation.",argumentative,"['finding be arrive investigation', ' pursue investigation', ' assess permissibility', ' to go rt', ' to enforce right']"
"Whilst Inspectors are accorded broad freedom in reporting on the affairs of public companies, the performance of their investigative functions is attended by not inconsiderable safeguards intended to ensure a fair procedure and the reliability of findings of fact.",argumentative,"['inspector be accord freedom', ' report affair', 'performance be attend safeguard', ' to ensure procedure']"
"Extremely serious accusations were levelled against the Inspectors by the applicants in the press release issued by them on the day of the publication of the Inspectors’ report, including accusations of dishonesty, prejudice, non-respect of agreed procedures, unfairness and total disregard of the principles of natural justice (see paragraph 32 above).",argumentative,"['accusation be level inspector', 'accusation be level applicant', 'accusation be level release', ' issue they', ' issue day', ' include accusation', ' see paragraph']"
"In correspondence with the authorities the applicants had previously been consistently threatening to take legal action to contest the report and its publication; yet in the event they did not do so, despite a formal undertaking on behalf of the Secretary of State to hold up publication if proceedings were brought (see paragraph 29 above).",argumentative,"['applicant have be threaten ', ' to take action', ' to test report', 'applicant do undertaking', ' to hold publication', 'proceeding be bring ', 'applicant see paragraph']"
"As the Government pointed out, a reading of the Inspectors’ report shows that the applicants were made aware of the information required of them and were given every reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them and to furnish evidence, notwithstanding their last-minute procedural request to the Inspectors (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",argumentative,"['government point ', 'reading show ', 'applicant be make aware', ' require they', 'applicant be give opportunity', ' to respond allegation', ' make they', ' to furnish evidence', ' withstand request', 'number see paragraph']"
"Safeguards afforded to the applicants throughout the investigation included constant consultation by the Inspectors as regards the structure, procedure and lines of inquiry of the investigation, the professional representation of the applicants, at interviews as well as in the submission of evidence and argument, and the Inspectors’ concern to respect the applicants’ personal privacy as much as possible (see paragraphs 15 to 18 and 20 above).",argumentative,"[' afford investigation', 'safeguard include sultation', ' regard structure', ' to respect privacy', ' see paragraph']"
"The applicants pointed out that the Inspectors’ report containing findings of dishonesty was published, with the benefit of protection from liability in defamation, even though the authorities decided that there was no cause for instituting either criminal or civil proceedings (see paragraphs 23, 27, 28 and 30 above).",argumentative,"['applicant point ', 'finding be publish benefit', 'authority decide ', 'there be cause', ' institute proceeding', ' see paragraph']"
The Court has also taken note of the evidence submitted by the applicants showing that there is a body of informed opinion in the United Kingdom which believes that these consequences of the system enacted by Parliament in the Companies Act 1985 are not desirable.,argumentative,"['court have take number', ' submit applicant', 'there be body', 'which believe ', ' enact parliament', ' enact act']"
"It is not, however, for the Court to substitute its own view for that of the national legislature as to what would be the most appropriate policy in this regard.",argumentative,"['court to substitute view', 'court to substitute that']"
"The risk of some uncompensated damage to reputation is inevitable if independent investigators in circumstances such as those of the present case are to have the necessary freedom to report without fear, not only to the authorities but also in the final resort to the public.",argumentative,"[' to have freedom', ' to report fear', ' to report authority']"
It is in the first place for the national authorities to determine the extent to which the individual’s interest in full protection of his or her reputation should yield to the requirements of the community’s interest in independent investigation of the affairs of large public companies.,argumentative,"['authority to determine extent', 'interest should yield requirement']"
"The applicants’ argument would amount to reading into Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) an entitlement to have a report such as the one in the present case not published until after a full judicial hearing repeating, doubtless over a longer time-scale, the same fact-finding exercise as that already carried out by the Inspectors.",argumentative,"['argument would amount ', ' read para', 'report publish ', ' repeat exercise', ' repeat scale', ' carry inspector']"
Such an entitlement could effectively destroy the utility of informing the public of the results of the administrative investigations provided for under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985.,argumentative,"['company destroy utility', ' inform public', ' inform result', ' provide section']"

"In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court cannot find that, in the exercise of their responsibility of regulating the conduct of the affairs of public companies, the national authorities exceeded their margin of appreciation to limit the applicant brothers’ access to the courts under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), either as regards the state of the applicable law or as regards the effects of the application of that law to the brothers.",argumentative,"['court can not find ', ' regulate duct', 'authority exceed margin', ' to limit access', ' to limit para', ' regard state', ' regard effect']"

"Although the investigation was administrative and not judicial in nature, the Inspectors were bound by what are known under English law as ""the rules of natural justice"" (see paragraph 39 above).",argumentative,"['inspector be bind ', 'what be know law', 'what be know rule', ' see paragraph']"
"Nonetheless, the manner in which findings detrimental to a person’s reputation are arrived at in an administrative investigation, as well as the objectives pursued by the investigation, is relevant for assessing the permissibility under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of a limitation on the person’s opportunities to go to court to enforce his or her civil right to reputation.",argumentative,"['finding be arrive investigation', ' pursue investigation', ' assess permissibility', ' to go rt', ' to enforce right']"
"Safeguards afforded to the applicants throughout the investigation included constant consultation by the Inspectors as regards the structure, procedure and lines of inquiry of the investigation, the professional representation of the applicants, at interviews as well as in the submission of evidence and argument, and the Inspectors’ concern to respect the applicants’ personal privacy as much as possible (see paragraphs 15 to 18 and 20 above).",argumentative,"[' afford investigation', 'safeguard include sultation', ' regard structure', ' to respect privacy', ' see paragraph']"
"In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court cannot find that, in the exercise of their responsibility of regulating the conduct of the affairs of public companies, the national authorities exceeded their margin of appreciation to limit the applicant brothers’ access to the courts under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), either as regards the state of the applicable law or as regards the effects of the application of that law to the brothers.",argumentative,"['court can not find ', ' regulate duct', 'authority exceed margin', ' to limit access', ' to limit para', ' regard state', ' regard effect']"

"The starting-point for the Court’s reasoning is its doctrine that Article 6 (art. 6) ""extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law"" (paragraph 65). 5. In my concurring opinion in the case of Salerno v. Italy (judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 245-D, pp. 57 et seq.), I examined the genesis of this doctrine. In paragraph 3.4 of that opinion I recalled that the doctrine had been fundamentally criticised on repeated occasions by several judges , but I left open whether I too subscribed to that criticism. I came to the conclusion that in any event there was no room for the ""arguable claim"" test where the applicant has in fact had access to a court which has decided on the merits of his claim: a decision on a non-arguable claim should also meet the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",argumentative,"[' extend dispute', 'which can be say ground', ' to be recognise paragraph', 'i examine genesis', 'i recall ', 'doctrine have be criticise occasion', 'doctrine have be criticise judge', 'i leave ', 'i subscribe criticism', 'i come clusion', 'there be room', 'applicant have have access', 'which have decide merit', 'decision should meet requirement']"

"In my opinion the Court’s reasoning would have been simpler and more persuasive without all this meandering necessitated by its maintaining the ""arguable claim"" test: there could be no doubt as to the applicants’ right to reputation having been damaged.",argumentative,['its maintain test']
"Whether or not a right to reputation is enshrined in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is immaterial, since such a right does exist, at least in principle, under all our national laws and it has not been contended that in this respect English law makes an exception by clearly and fully excluding such a right.",argumentative,"['right be enshrine art', 'right do exist principle', 'right do exist law', 'it have be tend ', 'law make exception', ' exclude right']"
"Neither can there be doubt as to the right to reputation being a ""civil"" right within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",argumentative,[]
"It follows that under this provision, whenever a person’s reputation has been interfered with, he or she is in principle entitled to access to a court meeting its requirements.",argumentative,"['it follow ', 'reputation have be interfere ', 'he be entitle access', ' meet requirement']"
"Consequently, the question whether under English law the defence of privilege constitutes a substantive limitation on the content of the right to reputation or a procedural barrier to access to court is immaterial. On this approach the Court could have gone into the essential question whether the contested limitation was justified under the conditions stated in its case-law (paragraph 68) almost immediately.",argumentative,"['company stitute limitation', 'ld have go question', 'limitation be justify dition', ' state law']"
"In the applicants’ submission, one of the objects of the inquiry by the Inspectors was to make findings as to whether the applicants were guilty of misconduct and the central conclusion of the report was that the applicants had dishonestly misled the authorities.",argumentative,"[' to make finding', 'applicant have mislead authority']"

"The Inspectors’ report, published to the world at large, had the force of a judgment convicting the applicants of dishonesty.",argumentative,"[' publish world', 'report have force', ' victe applicant', ' victe dishonesty']"
"The result of the inquiry was thus directly decisive for the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation.

"The right of access to the courts secured by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access ‘by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals’.",argumentative,"['right rts secure para', 'these be permit implication', 'right call regulation', 'which may vary time', ' accord need']"
