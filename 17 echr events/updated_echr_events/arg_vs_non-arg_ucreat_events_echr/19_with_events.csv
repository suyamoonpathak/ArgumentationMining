"The lack of impartiality is evidenced by the intemperate reaction of the judges to the conduct of the applicant, as evidenced by their haste to try him summarily for the criminal offence of contempt of court without availing themselves of other alternative, less drastic, measures such as a warning, reporting the applicant to his professional body, refusing to hear the applicant unless he withdrew his statements, or asking him to leave the courtroom.",argumentative,"['lack be evidence reaction', ' evidence haste', ' to try he', ' to try offence', ' avail themselves', ' avail measure', ' report applicant', ' report body', ' to hear applicant', 'he withdraw statement', ' ask he', ' to leave rtroom']"
