The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.,premise
"An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (cf. No. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78).

The Commission finds that the suggested application for discretionary relief in the instant case cannot do so either.,conclusion

"The Commission recalls that in the case of
Temple v. the United Kingdom (No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171) the Commission held that recourse to a purely discretionary power on the part of the Secretary of State did not constitute an effective domestic remedy.",premise

" Insofar as the applicant complains of the alleged shortfall of official sites for gypsies in the Willingham area, the Government submit that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies",conclusion
,
"The Secretary of State's power under section 9 is, she contends, discretionary and rarely exercised.",premise
The applicant submits there are no effective remedies which she is obliged to exhaust.,conclusion
,
"To the extent that there might have been any interference with her rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1), the Government consider that the refusal of planning permission and issue of the enforcement notices are justified by the interests of public safety on the road, the economic well-being of the country and the protection of the environment.",premise
"As for the framework of regulation, including the designation system, this is stated to represent a proportionate response to the need to protect public safety on the roads as well as the rights of others.",premise

,
"She submits that there is an acknowledged shortfall of sites for gypsies in South Cambridgeshire and that local authorities are failing to fulfil their statutory duty to provide sites.",premise
"The applicant also contends that it is a practical impossibility for her to station her caravans on her sister's site and that even if there were vacant pitches on the nearby official site, it is overcrowded and has a reputation for violence which renders it an unsafe location for a single woman living alone with her children.",premise
"Further, the designation system which discriminates against gypsies prevents her moving onto unoccupied land or stationing her caravans near the highway.",premise
" As a result, the applicant contends that she has nowhere she can legally or safely go.",conclusion

"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",premise

"For these reasons, the Commission by a majority

      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits.",conclusion

      protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the
