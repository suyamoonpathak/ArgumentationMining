RESS\r\n\r\n           Mr.   H.C. KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\nHaving regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the application introduced on 11 July 1991 by Sadik AHMET against Greece and registered on 27 September 1991 under file No. 18877/91;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to:\r\n\r\n-     reports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n-     the observations submitted by the respondent Government on 8 and\r\n      29 October 1993 and the observations in reply submitted by the\r\n      applicant on 18 November 1993;\r\n\r\n-     the parties' oral submissions at the hearing on 1st July 1994;\r\n\r\n      Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n      Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant is a Greek national born in 1947. He is a physician\r\nand resides in Komotini.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be\r\nsummarised as follows:\r\n\r\n      The applicant was elected Member of Parliament in June 1989 and was a potential candidate at the election on 5 November 1989. In October 1989, the applicant and B., another candidate, distributed leaflets which, inter alia, referred to the \"Turkish minority\" of Western Thrace.\r\n\r\n      The applicant and B. were subsequently charged with misinforming the electoral body, an offence established by Article 162 of the Greek Penal Code, because in the leaflet they had stated that the candidates of the main political parties had created a climate of terror and anarchy among the Moslem population. They were further charged with \"disrupting public peace\" (diataraxi koinis eirinis), an offence under Article 192 of the Penal Code, by openly and indirectly inciting citizens to violence or by creating rifts among the population by the use of the words \"Turk(s)\" or \"Turkish\" to identify the Moslems of Western Thrace.\r\n\r\n      On 25 January 1990 the applicant appeared before the Criminal Court (Trimeles Plimmeleiodikeio) of Rhodopi charged with the above offences. While the interrogation of witnesses was taking place the applicant requested that one of the judges be discharged because the way in which he put questions indicated that he was biased. This request was rejected.\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleges that at one stage he requested the proceedings to be adjourned because of the absence of his lawyer, but that his request was also rejected. However this event does not appear in the records of the hearing.\r\n\r\n      On 26 January 1990 the applicant was acquitted of misinformation but found guilty of disrupting public peace. The Court held that by the end of October 1989 the applicant had distributed to the population of Komotini and other places in the District of Rhodopi printed material which repeatedly contained the terms \"Turk\", \"Turkish Moslem\", and the \"Turkish Moslem minority of Western Thrace\", referring to the Greek Moslem citizens of Rhodopi. The Court held that the applicant had thereby aimed at creating feelings of hatred and enmity and at dividing the population. According to the judgment, his purpose was to incite the population of each community to act violently against the other and to disrupt, as he actually did, the peaceful co-existence of the Greek Christian and the Greek Moslem communities.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was sentenced by the Criminal Court to 18 months' imprisonment, not convertible into a fine. His request to the Court to suspend the sentence pending his eventual appeal was rejected, inter alia, on the ground that the applicant was dangerous and that there was a risk that he would flee to Turkey.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was detained from 26 January to 30 March 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 27 January 1990 the applicant appealed against the above judgment.\r\n\r\n      By the end of January 1990 violence erupted in Komotini which resulted in damage to numerous businesses and shops. A Christian was killed by a Moslem in a hospital.\r\n\r\n      On 30 March 1990 the Court of Appeal (Trimeles Efeteio) of Patras confirmed the first instance judgment, declaring the applicant guilty of disrupting public peace.\r\n\r\n      The Court found that the applicant had deliberately described the Greek Moslems of Western Thrace as \"Turks\", although he knew that the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne refers and recognises only a religious (Moslem) minority and not a Turkish (ethnic) minority. It held that the applicant aimed at creating feelings of hatred and hostility within the Moslem community towards the Greek Christians, and that he had succeeded in disrupting public peace in Komotini, as well as creating violent events in this town. However, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 15 months' imprisonment, convertible to a fine.\r\n\r\n      On 8 April 1990, after his release from prison, the applicant was re-elected to the Greek Parliament.\r\n\r\n      On 24 October 1990 the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation (Areios Pagos).\r\n\r\n      In his appeal he complained that the charges against him were vague and that the courts should have declared the prosecution case inadmissible. He further complained that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not sufficiently reasoned as required by the Constitution and the law. In this respect he complained that the Court did not indicate in what way the use of the word \"Turk\" or \"Turkish\" was capable of creating a climate of hatred or of disrupting public peace. He also complained that the judgment gave no concrete examples of any event having actually occurred by the end of October 1989 which could have been regarded as a genuine disruption of public peace or a disturbance of public order.\r\n\r\n      On 15 February 1991 the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal. The Court found that the judgment of the Court of Appeal had been sufficiently reasoned.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant alleges that he was unlawfully deprived of his liberty between 26 January and 30 March 1990 and invokes Article 5 paras. 1, 3 and 4 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant complains under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention that insufficient reasons were given by the courts to justify his conviction.\r\n\r\n3.    The applicant complains that the proceedings against him were not fair and invokes Article 6 paras. 1, 2, 3 and Article 14 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n4.    The applicant submits that his conviction for disrupting public peace, by distributing printed material referring to the Moslem population of Western Thrace as \"Turks\", amounts to a violation of his freedom of thought, expression and assembly, and is discriminatory. He invokes Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n5.    Finally, the applicant complains, under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1, that due to his imprisonment in February and March 1990 he was unable to participate in the campaign for the legislative election of April 1990.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 11 July 1991 and registered on 27 September 1991.\r\n\r\n      On 3 May 1993 the Commission decided to bring the application to the notice of the respondent Government and to invite them to submit written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application, limited to the issue under Article 10 of Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Government submitted their observations on 8 October 1993 and their supplementary observations on 29 October 1993.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submitted observations in reply on 18 November 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 14 April 1994 the Commission decided to hear the parties as to the admissibility and merits of the case.\r\n\r\n      At the oral hearing, which was held on 1 July 1994, the parties were represented as follows :\r\n\r\nFor the Government :\r\n\r\nMr. Vassilios KONTOLAIMOS        Legal Assessor at the Legal\r\n                                 Council of State, Agent\r\n\r\nMs. Vassilia PELEKOU             Legal Representative at the Legal\r\n                                 Council of State, Adviser\r\n\r\nFor the applicant :\r\n\r\nProf. Tekin AKKILIOGLOU          Lawyer practising in Ankara,\r\n\r\n      The applicant was also present at the hearing.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant, who was detained between 26 January and 30 March 1990, complains that this deprivation of liberty was contrary to Article 5 paras. 1, 3 and 4 (Art. 5-1, 5-3, 5-4) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention guarantees the right to liberty and security of person, subject to certain exceptions, such as the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court, within the meaning of sub-paragraph (a) of the provision. Article 5 paras. 3 and 4 (Art. 5-3, 5-4) provide certain guarantees of judicial control of provisional release or detention on remand pending trial.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that the applicant was detained after having been sentenced by the first instance court to 18 months' imprisonment. He was released after the Court of Appeal reviewed this sentence, reducing it to 15 months' imprisonment, convertible to a fine. The Commission finds that the applicant was deprived of his liberty \"after conviction by a competent court\" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (a) (Art. 5-1-a) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Commission also finds no evidence in the case to suggest an infringement of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 5 (Art. 5-3, 5-4): The applicant was not detained on remand prior to his trial and the judicial control of the lawfulness of his subsequent detention after conviction was provided by the first instance court (cf. Eur. Court H.R., De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 40, para. 76).\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill- founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant next complains under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention of an unfair hearing in the determination of the criminal charges against him, in that , allegedly, insufficient reasons were given by the courts to justify his conviction.\r\n\r\n      However, again, the Commission finds no evidence in the case to substantiate this complaint.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the application is also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n3.    The applicant further complains of the attitude of some of the judges and of not having received a written copy of the first instance judgment in time for the preparation of his appeal. He alleges that witnesses on his behalf were not duly heard by the courts.\r\n\r\n      The appliacnt invokes Article 6 paras. 1, 2, 3 (b) and (d) (Art. 6-1, 6-2, 6-3-b, 6-3-d) of the Convention, which provides certain guarantees to the defence in a criminal case, and Article 14 (Art. 14), which prohibits discrimination in the securement of Convention rights and freedoms.\r\n\r\n      However, the Commission is not required to decide whether the facts alleged by the applicant disclose any appearance of a violation of these provisions. Under the terms of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, \"the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law\".\r\n\r\n      For this condition to be fulfilled, it is not sufficient for the applicant merely to have presented his case to the various courts competent to deal with it. The complaint made before the Commission must also have been raised, at least in substance, during the proceedings in question. On this point, the Commission refers to its constant case-law (see, for example, No. 12164/86, Dec. 12.10.88, Agneessens v. Belgium, D.R. 58 p. 63).\r\n\r\n      In the present case, the Commission notes that none of these complaints has been raised either formally or even in substance during the proceedings before the Court of Cassation. In addition, the examination of the case has disclosed no circumstance which, according to the generally recognised principles of international law, might have absolved the applicant from raising these complaints during the cassation proceedings.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the application must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, in accordance with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n4.    The applicant also complains that his conviction for disrupting public peace, by distributing printed material referring to the Moslem population of Western Thrace as \"Turks\", amounts to a violation of his freedom of thought, expression and assembly, and is discriminatory. He invokes Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 (Art. 8, 10, 11, 14) of the Convention, which guarantee these freedoms and prohibit discrimination respectively.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that the applicant's conviction involved his writings. Consequently, it is essentially the exercise of the applicant's freedom of expression with which there has been an interference.\r\n\r\n      The relevant part of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  Everyone has the right to the freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authorities and regardless of frontiers ...\r\n\r\n      2.   The exercice of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime ...\".\r\n\r\n      The respondent Government considers that the applicant submitted his application out of time on 27 September 1991, which is more than six months after the date on which the final decision regarding the applicant's case was given by the Court of Cassation on 15 February 1991.\r\n\r\n      However, the application was lodged with the Commission on 11 July 1991, five months after the cassation decision, and therefore within the six month time-limit provided for by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Government next submits, in respect of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies because at no time at first instance, on appeal or in cassation did the applicant raise the issues under the Convention, even in substance.\r\n\r\n      In reply the applicant maintains that the breach of which he is complaining consists of a continuing violation, and that therefore he was absolved from the obligation of raising the complaint before the Greek courts.\r\n\r\n      The Commission observes that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention \"should be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism ; it is sufficient that the complaints intended to be made subsequently before the Convention organs should have been raised at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law\" (Eur. Court H.R., Castells judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 19, para. 27).\r\n\r\n      It is true that before the Court of Cassation the applicant did not rely expressly on Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention, which is directly applicable under Greek law; nor did he invoke the provisions of Article 14 of the Greek Constitution, which also guarantees the right to freedom of expression. However, while basing his case on the narrower domestic criminal law provision of Article 192 of the Greek Penal Code, the applicant claimed the right to use the words \"Turk(s)\" or \"Turkish\" to identify the Moslems of Western Thrace.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that this indicates an issue falling within the scope of freedom of expression. In claiming a right to use these terms the applicant was formulating a complaint which was linked to the alleged violation of Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention. Therefore, \"he provided the national courts with the opportunity which is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by Article 26 (Art. 26), namely the opportunity of putting right the violations alleged against them\" (Eur. Court H.R., Guzzardi judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 27, para. 72).\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the Commission considers that the applicant did invoke before the Greek courts, at least in substance, the complaints relating to Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention which he now puts to the Commision. He may therefore be said to have exhausted domestic remedies.\r\n\r\n      The Commission concludes that the applicant has complied with the requirements of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      As regards the merits of the complaint, the Government maintains that the interference was prescribed by law, in this case Article 192 of the Penal Code. The Government asserts that the proceedings instituted against the applicant and his ensuing conviction pursued the legitimate aim of protecting public order, within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (Art. 10-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant does not dispute the existence of a legal basis for his conviction, but he maintains that the conviction and punishment inflicted upon him were without any legitimate purpose under the Convention and alleges that they constituted a kind of reprisal for his assertion of his Turkish ethnic origin. He also maintains that his conviction and the penal sanctions inflicted upon him were not necessary in a democratic society. He stresses the key role played by freedom of expression in a democratic society. The importance of this freedom is even greater for an elected representative whose mandate is to act as spokesman for the opinions and concerns of his constituents.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that the applicant's complaints, that his conviction for disrupting public peace amounts to a violation of his rights under the Convention, raise complex issues of fact and law, the determination of which should depend on a full examination of the merits. These complaints cannot therefore be regarded as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention, and no other ground for declaring this part of the case inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n5.    Finally, the applicant complains, under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-3), that he was prevented from participating in the campaign for the legislative election of April 1990 because of his detention.\r\n\r\n      Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-3) provides for free elections under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that this matter was not submitted to the competent court, which is the Special Supreme Court, and consequently this part of the application is inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the application must be rejected in accordance with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission, by a majority,\r\n\r\n      DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case, the applicant's complaint that his conviction for having disrupted public peace amounts to a violation of his rights set forth in the Convention;\r\n\r\n      DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application.\r\n\r\n      Secretary to the Commission           President of the Commission\r\n\r\n           (H.C.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\nHaving regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the application introduced on 20 May 1993 by Zeki Aksoy against Turkey and registered on 7 June 1993 under file No. 21987/93;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to:\r\n\r\n-     the reports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n-     the observations submitted by the respondent Government on 21 February 1994 and the observations in reply submitted by the applicant on 15 April 1994;\r\n\r\n-     information submitted by the applicant's representatives on 20 April 1994, and additional material submitted on 15 August, 20 September and 4 October 1994;\r\n\r\n-     information submitted by the Government on 20 September 1994 and additional material submitted on 4 and 7 October 1994;\r\n\r\n-     the parties' oral submissions at the hearing on 18 October 1994;\r\n\r\n      Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n      Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant, a Turkish national born in 1963, was a welder by profession. He died on 16 April 1994. His legal representatives before the Commission are Professor Kevin Boyle and Ms. Françoise Hampson, both university teachers at the University of Essex.\r\n\r\nA.    The particular circumstances of the case\r\n\r\n      The facts of the present case are in dispute.\r\n\r\n      It is claimed on behalf of the applicant that the following events occurred:\r\n\r\n      On 24 November 1992, the applicant was at home with his family. At around 23.00 to 24.00 hours, about twenty policemen arrived, some in uniform and some in plain clothes. They searched the house. They were accompanied by someone who had shown them the house. The applicant's father, mother and five brothers were also at home that night. The applicant was taken, together with one of his brothers, to Kiziltepe Security Headquarters. His brother was released after 11 days. The applicant's house was raided throughout the week following his incarceration. On the ninth day of his detention, his father was taken into custody.\r\n\r\n      The applicant spent the first night in Kiziltepe Security Headquarters and was then transferred to Mardin Political Branch Headquarters. He was held there for 16 days. He was asked whether he knew someone called Metin. On the second day the applicant was taken to the interrogation room where the blindfold which had been over his eyes was removed. He was shown a person called Metin who had accompanied the police when the applicant was arrested.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was then stripped naked and his hands were tied behind his back. He was strung up. This kind of torture is known as \"Palestinian hanging\". While he was strung up, the police connected electrodes to his genitals. He was kicked, slapped and verbally abused in every imaginable way. As they electrocuted him, the police threw water over him. He was again blindfolded during this torture. As far as he could tell, it continued for about 35 minutes. During the next two days, he was repeatedly beaten at intervals of two hours or half an hour, without being suspended. The torture continued for four days, the first two being very intensive. He lost the movement of his arms and hands as a result. His interrogators ordered him to make movements to restore the control of his hands.\r\n\r\n      The applicant asked to see a doctor, but was refused. Before people were released they were seen by a doctor. When the applicant\r\nknew that the doctor was in the building, he unsuccessfully banged on his door to get attention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was kept in a cell with two others. The cell measured about 1,5 x 3 metres. There was one bed and one blanket between them. There was no pillow.\r\n\r\n      Two days before his release, the police took the applicant to see an official forensic doctor, but the doctor gave him no medicine and wrote no report or prescription. When the doctor asked how the applicant's arms had been injured, the accompanying police officers intervened and said that the applicant had had an accident.  It is alleged that the doctor commented, mockingly, that everyone who went to those police headquarters suffered an accident.\r\n\r\n      On 10 December 1992, the applicant was released. He had been brought previously before the public prosecutor. He was presented with a statement to sign, but the applicant said that its contents were untrue and that he had been tortured. The prosecutor insisted he sign it. When he told the prosecutor that he could not sign because he could not move his hands, the prosecutor bowed his head and said, \"You are free to go\". The prosecutor did not ask any questions about the applicant's condition or its causes. Rather his energies were directed at determining whether the applicant should be prosecuted.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was released on a Thursday and saw a doctor on the Friday. The following Tuesday, he completed the hospital paperwork and was admitted to Dicle University Medical Faculty. The applicant's account of his treatment in custody is consistent with a medical report from this Faculty, but the doctor whom he consulted was too frightened to record an explicit explanation of the cause of the applicant's injuries. A medical report from a surgeon at St. George's Hospital, London, based on photographs of the applicant's injuries, supports the applicant's claims of his torture in custody. The applicant remained in hospital until 31 December 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 21 December 1992, the public prosecutor decided that there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant.\r\n\r\n      By telefax  of 20 April 1994, the applicant's representatives informed the Commission that the applicant had been killed four days before. It was alleged that he had been killed as a direct result of his application to the Commission. He had been threatened with death in order to make him withdraw his application, the last threat being made by telephone 14 April 1994. Two days later, on the evening of 16 April 1994, he was shot and killed by two people as he was on his way home.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit the following different account of events:\r\n\r\n      On 26 November 1992 at around 8.30 hours, the applicant was arrested at his home and placed in police custody at the Mardin Security Directorate, along with 13 other people, on suspicion of aiding and abetting the terrorist wing of the PKK, of being a member of the Kiziltepe PKK branch and of distributing PKK tracts.\r\n\r\n      On 8 December 1992, after questioning, he was brought before the Mardin public prosecutor and released on 10 December 1992. The\r\napplicant did not complain of torture or ill-treatment, which is why no ex officio investigation was made. (If he made any mention of such\r\ntreatment the prosecutor would have been obliged to open a judicial inquiry under Articles 243 and 245 of the Criminal Code [p. 6 below]).\r\nThat same day the applicant was examined by a doctor in the medical service of the sub-prefecture. He found no evidence of injury to the\r\napplicant.\r\n\r\n      On 21 December 1992, the principal public prosecutor at the Diyarbakir State Security Court ordered that no proceedings be brought against the applicant and two other people. Proceedings were instituted, however, against the eleven other people who had been detained with the applicant.\r\n\r\n      On 15 December 1992 the applicant was admitted to the Diyarbakir State Hospital as a first examination had diagnosed a bilateral radial paralysis. He left the hospital without discharging himself properly on 31 December 1992, taking his medical file with him. He was formally discharged on 8 January 1993.\r\n\r\n      As regards the circumstances of the applicant's death, the Government state that a person has been arrested and charged with the applicant's murder, and is presently remanded in custody awaiting trial. This person is a member of the PKK and is suspected of several acts of murder and bombing. The applicant's murder was apparently a settlement of scores between quarrelling PKK factions.\r\n\r\n      According to the applicant's representatives, the person in question was originally charged in May 1994 with the unlawful possession of weapons. It was only in September 1994 that the murder charge was added.\r\n\r\nB.    The relevant domestic law and practice\r\n\r\n      The Government have submitted that the following domestic law is relevant to the case:\r\n\r\n      Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      (translation)\r\n\r\n      \"All acts or decisions of the Administration are subject to judicial review ...\r\n\r\n      The Administration shall be liable for damage caused by its own acts and measures.\"\r\n\r\n      This provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war.  The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the Administration, whose liability is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a theory of \"social risk\". Thus the Administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unidentified persons when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.\r\n\r\n      The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional Article 1 of Law 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides:\r\n\r\n      (translation)\r\n\r\n      \"... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this law are to be brought against the Administration before the administrative courts.\"\r\n\r\n      The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence to subject someone to torture or ill-treatment (Article 243 in respect of torture, and Article 245 in respect of ill-treatment, inflicted by civil servants).\r\n\r\n      Complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\n      If the alleged author of a crime is a State official or civil servant, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). The local council decisions may be appealed to the State Council; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind. There is case-law showing the overturn by the State Council of decisions of the Executive Committee not to prosecute cases of torture and ill-treatment of people in the custody of security officials.\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to Article 1 of Law 466, a person who has been unjustly held in police custody may apply to the local assize court for compensation within three months of the decision not to prosecute.\r\n\r\n      Furthermore, any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or tort, which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts.\r\n\r\n      Proceedings against the Administration may be brought before the\r\nadministrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing.\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to Article 128 to the Code of Criminal Procedure, a person arrested and detained shall be brought before a justice of peace within twenty-four hours, or, in the case of collective offences, within four days. In the proceedings before the State Security Courts, these periods are extended, pursuant to Article 30 of Law 3842 of 1 December 1992, to forty-eight hours in the case of individual offences, and to fifteen days in the case of collective offences. Pursuant to the same Article, in cases involving a state of emergency, the custody periods in the proceedings before the State Security Courts are  doubled: four days in the case of individual offences, thirty days in the case of collective offences.\r\n\r\n      The applicant pointed to certain legal provisions which in themselves weaken the protection of the individual which might otherwise have been afforded by the above general scheme:\r\n\r\n      Articles 13 to 15 of the Constitution provide for fundamental limitations on constitutional safeguards.\r\n\r\n      Provisional Article 15 of the Constitution provides that there can be no allegation of unconstitutionality in respect of measures taken under laws or decrees having the force of law and enacted between 12 September 1980 and 25 October 1983. That includes Law 2935 on the State of Emergency of 25 October 1983, under which decrees have been issued which are immune from judicial challenge. Extensive powers have been granted to the Regional Governor of the State of Emergency by such decrees.\r\n\r\n      Decree 285 modifies the application of Law 3713, the Anti-Terror Law (1981), in those areas subject to the state of emergency, with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils. These councils are made up of civil servants and have been criticised for their lack of legal knowledge, as well as for being easily influenced by the Regional Governor or Provincial Governors, who also head the security forces.\r\n\r\n      Article 8 of Decree 430 of 16 December 1990 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      (translation)\r\n\r\n      \"No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the State of Emergency Regional Governor or a Provincial Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of an individual to claim indemnity from the State for damages suffered by them without justification.\"\r\n\r\n      According to the applicant, this Article grants impunity to the Governors.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleged that he had been the victim of a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the infliction of torture and the conditions of his detention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant complained under Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention of not having been brought before the public prosecutor until 16 days after his arrest.\r\n\r\n      The applicant claimed that there was a breach of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the failure to institute court proceedings against those responsible for the torture, as a result of which he could bring the civil proceedings which should ensue.\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleged a violation of Article 13 of the Convention on account of the lack of an independent authority before which a complaint can be brought with any prospect of success.\r\n\r\n      After the applicant's death on 16 April 1994, his representatives have alleged that he was killed because of his application to the Commission.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 20 May 1993 and registered on 7 June 1993.\r\n\r\n      After a preliminary examination of the case by the Rapporteur, the Commission considered the admissibility of the application on 30 August 1993. It decided, pursuant to Rule 48 para. 2 (b) of the Rules of Procedure, to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and to invite the parties to submit written observations on admissibility and merits. The Government's observations were submitted on 21 February 1994, after an extension of the time limit fixed for that purpose, to which the applicant replied on 15 April 1994.\r\n\r\n      On 20 April 1994 the applicant's representatives informed the Commission that the applicant had been shot and killed on 16 April 1994. It was alleged that the killing was a direct result of the application to the Commission. This information was transmitted to the Government with a request for comment as to the allegation. The Government failed to respond within the time-limit fixed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n      On 27 June 1994 the Commission decided to invite the parties to make oral submissions on the admissibility of the application at a hearing.  For the purposes of the hearing the application was joined to two others: No. 21893/93, Akduvar and Others v. Turkey, and No. 21894/93, Akkum and Others v. Turkey.  The hearing was fixed for 18 October 1994.  Prior to the hearing the parties submitted additional material: for the applicant on 15 August, 20 September and 4 October 1994, and for the Government on 4 and 7 October 1994.\r\n\r\n      The Government commented on the circumstances of the applicant's death by letter of 20 September 1994, in which the allegations of the applicant's representatives were denied.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing on 18 October 1994, the Government were represented by Mr. B. Çaglar, Agent, Mr. S. Alpaslan, Mr. M. Özmen, Ms. D. Akçay and Mr. H. Golsong, all counsel, and Ms. i. Boivin, Mr. i. Kovar, Mr. A. Kurudal, Mr. F. Erdogan, Mr. Y. Kizilkaya, Mr. C. Duatepe and Ms. S.B. Ersöz, all experts.  The applicants was represented by Professor K. Boyle and Ms. F. Hampson, both counsel, Mr. S. Aslantas, legal adviser from the Diyarbakir Bar, and Mr. M. Yildiz, assistant.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant, who had been arrested by the Turkish police, complained of having been subjected to torture (Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention) and of not having been brought promptly before a judicial officer (Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention). He also complained of violations of Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, by reason of allegedly inadequate remedies. His representatives have asserted that the applicant was killed because of his application to the Commission.\r\n\r\n2.    The Government have questioned whether it is justified for the Commission to continue these proceedings after the applicant's death. They have stated that his heirs have not indicated whether they wish to pursue the case and that, in any event, heirs have no right to complain of the duration and allegedly inequitable character of proceedings.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes the declaration by the applicant's representatives that the applicant's father wishes to pursue proceedings before the Commission. Moreover, it finds that, in view of the serious nature of the complaints and their connection with the general situation in South-East Turkey, the application is of such general interest that it would not be justified to strike it off the list of cases.\r\n\r\n3.    The Government deny that there is any evidence that the applicant had been subjected to torture or other treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, or that his death involved any State responsibility.\r\n\r\n      The Government argue that the application is inadmissible for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n      i. the applicant failed to exhaust domestic remedies;\r\n\r\n      ii. alternatively, the applicant did not observe the six months' time-limit;\r\n\r\n      iii. the application is an abuse of the right of petition;\r\n\r\n      iv. the derogation which Turkey has made under Article 15 (Art. 15) of the Convention legitimised the applicant's detention for 14 days under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention; and\r\n\r\n      v. the application is anyway manifestly ill-founded.\r\n\r\n4.    Exhaustion of domestic remedies\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the applicant failed to comply with the requirement under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention to exhaust domestic remedies, particularly in regard to his complaint under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, before lodging an application with the Commission.  They contend that the applicant had several remedies at his disposal which he did not try:\r\n\r\n      i.   By way of the administrative and civil courts\r\n\r\n      According to the applicant's version of the facts, which is anyway denied, security officers unjustifiably detained and severely ill-treated him. However, he had the possibility of introducing an administrative action before the administrative courts for compensation in accordance with Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution (pp. 5-6 above). Claims for compensation could also have been lodged before the local assize court, pursuant to Article 1 of Law 466, or before the ordinary civil courts (p. 6 above).\r\n\r\n      ii.  By way of criminal proceedings\r\n\r\n      The acts alleged by the applicant have no lawful authority either under ordinary domestic law or under emergency legislation or decrees. They would constitute punishable criminal offences under the criminal law. The applicant therefore had the possibility of lodging a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities (see p. 6 above).\r\n\r\n      The Government assert that there is no administrative practice or official tolerance of the type of acts alleged by the applicant. The aforementioned remedies represent nothing extraordinary and are accessible and effective before independent judicial authorities. Any suggestion that people expose themselves to risk if they pursue these normal remedies can only be qualified as abusive, fallacious and wholly devoid of credibility.\r\n\r\n      In order to demonstrate that the available remedies were not ineffective, the Government have referred to a number of judgments by the administrative and criminal courts. Some of these decisions concern cases in which the State Council has ordered the prosecution of public officials for ill-treating people in custody, despite the initial view of the local administrative council that the cases were unsuitable for criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\n      The applicant maintained that there was no requirement that he pursue domestic remedies further than he did by telling the public prosecutor that he had been tortured by his custodians. The public prosecutor is deemed to be under a duty to prosecute all reported crimes, but did nothing in the applicant's case.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective. He did not deny that the procedures identified by the Government are formally part of the Turkish legal structure, but he contended that the Government have not shown how such procedures could conceivably be effective for the specific circumstances of the present case.\r\n\r\n      The applicant considered that none of the remedies suggested by the Government could be regarded as effective because the scale of torture committed with impunity by agents of the State in detention centres is such that this must be considered high-level Government policy - an administrative practice - in regard to which all remedies are theoretical and irrelevant. This has been confirmed by such bodies as the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which, in its public statement of 15 December 1992, concluded that the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in Turkey, and that such methods are applied to both ordinary criminal suspects and persons held under anti-terrorist provisions (p. 6 para. 21). The Committee singled out \"cases of motor paralysis of the arms and severe sensory loss consistent with allegations of suspension\", being an especially widespread torture method in Turkey, particularly in the South-East (p. 5 para. 19). It called on Public Prosecutors in Turkey \"to react expeditiously and effectively when confronted with complaints of torture and ill- treatment\" (p.7 para. 26), which, according to the applicant, implies that they were failing to do so at the material time.\r\n\r\n      The purported remedies were thus ineffective for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n-     the limitations on rights and remedies created by the state of emergency;\r\n\r\n-     an administrative practice of torture in Turkish detention centres;\r\n\r\n-     the lack of genuine investigations by public prosecutors and other competent authorities, who ignore the evidence of their own eyes, as in this case, and either do nothing or simply take evidence from the members of the police or security forces;\r\n\r\n-     even if an investigation is made, the lack of effective action being taken afterwards;\r\n\r\n-     an official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces;\r\n\r\n-     the positive discouragement of those who do wish to seek remedies, as has been demonstrated so tragically in the present case;\r\n\r\n-     an administrative practice of not respecting the rule under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention which requires the provision of effective domestic remedies; and\r\n\r\n-     whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic remedies were ineffective in this case, owing to the failure of the legal system to provide redress.\r\n\r\n      The applicant added that, in order to be able to use a remedy, the individual needs to be able to seek and obtain legal advice and the lawyers need to be able to pursue appropriate remedies without fear of the consequences. He alleged, however, that several lawyers who have dealt with cases of this kind have been subjected to detention and ill- treatment. At present 16 lawyers are facing criminal charges, which include drawing up documents belittling the Turkish State and faxing them to human rights organisations in Europe. This is demonstrated in other cases pending before the Commission.\r\n\r\n      Another key group in guaranteeing effective investigation and protection is the medical profession. Doctors must be free to give\r\nhonest accounts of what they have found in their investigations. However, the applicant alleged that doctors have been intimidated, as\r\nwas the case of the doctor whom he consulted at the Dicle Medical Faculty.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has noted the range of remedies put forward by the Government, the case-law provided to demonstrate the efficacy of those remedies and the remarks of the applicant as to their theoretical and illusory nature.\r\n\r\n      The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicant, because it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances. The Commission has formed this view for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes the applicant's declaration that he had told the public prosecutor that he had been tortured. Moreover, when asked to sign a statement, he had answered that he could not sign because he could not move his hands. It is not possible to establish in detail what happened during the applicant's meeting with the public prosecutor, but the Commission finds no reason to doubt that during their conversation there were elements which should have made the public prosecutor initiate an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information from the applicant about his state of health or about the treatment to which he had been subjected.\r\n\r\n      The Commission further notes that, after his detention, the applicant was in a vulnerable position, if he had, as he stated, been subjected to torture during his detention. Moreover, his family had also been affected by the actions of the authorities insofar as his father and one of his brothers had been detained for short periods at about the same time, and the applicant himself was hospitalised for two weeks after his release. The threats to which the applicant claimed to have been exposed after he had complained to the Commission, as well as his tragic death in circumstances which have so far not been fully clarified, are further elements which may at least support the view that the pursuance of remedies may not be devoid of serious risks.\r\n\r\n      The Commission is, therefore, satisfied that the applicant did avail himself of a proper remedy when appearing before the public prosecutor prior to his release and that he was not obliged to pursue in the circumstances further remedies indicated by the Government (cf. Nos. 16311/90, 16312/90 and 16313/90, N.H., G.H. and R.A. v. Turkey, Dec. 11.10.91, unpublished; No. 17126/90, S.Ö. v. Turkey, Dec. 30.08.94, unpublished, and mutatis mutandis No. 19092/91, Yagiz v. Turkey, Dec. 11.10.93, to be published in D.R. 75). The Commission concludes that the applicant may be said to have complied with the domestic remedies' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention and, consequently, the application cannot be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3).\r\n\r\n5.    The six months' rule\r\n\r\n      The Government contend that, even assuming that the applicant exhausted domestic remedies, he failed to comply with the second requirement of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, namely that of lodging the application within six months of the final effective decision or, if none, within six months of the events of which complaints are made.\r\n\r\n      The applicant pointed out that the events complained of took place between 24 November and 10 December 1992. The present application\r\nwas lodged on 3 May 1993, i.e. within the six month period. \r\n\r\n      The Commission agrees with the applicant. He did indeed comply with the six months' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n6.    Abuse of the right of petition\r\n\r\n      The Government maintain that the application, being devoid of any sound judicial basis, has been lodged for the purposes of political propaganda against the Turkish Government.  Accordingly the application constitutes an abuse of the right of petition which discredits the legal nature of the Convention control mechanism.\r\n\r\n      The applicant rejected the Government's submission and responded that his complaints related exclusively to violations of the Convention which he suffered.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts. However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings, and it is therefore impossible to reject the application on this ground.\r\n\r\n7.    As regards the merits\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that it is generally accepted in the comparative and international law on terrorism, authorising \"certain adaptations of the liberal model\", that restrictions on Convention rights will be deemed necessary in a democratic society threatened by terrorist violence, as being proportionate to the aim of protecting public order.\r\n\r\n      The threat posed to Turkey by the PKK and its affiliations is internationally recognised, as is the need to react firmly to it. Terrorism strikes at the heart of democracy, its fundamental rights and the judicial and political systems.  This has been acknowledged by the Convention organs (Eur. Court H.R., Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, and Nos. 11209/84, 11234/84, 11266/84 and 11386/85, Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, Comm. Report 14.5.87 para. 106). It is not for the Convention organs to substitute their view on how a State should conduct the necessary fight against terrorism. In this respect the Government assert that the powers exercised by the police while the applicant was in their custody did not exceed the margin of appreciation conferred on States by the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Government maintain that there is no evidence to substantiate the applicant's allegations against the police under Article 3\r\n(Art. 3) of the Convention. They add that his death was not the work of any State agent but that of terrorist in-fighting.\r\n\r\n      In respect of the applicant's allegation under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention, the Government refer to their derogation under Article 15 (Art. 15) of the Convention since 6 August 1990 suspending the former Article's applicability. As to Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, the Government submit that Turkish law guarantees several remedies (as described above at pp. 5-6) without discrimination.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the Government consider that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant maintained that his account of events was accurate and that his Convention claims were substantiated. He contended that the Government's submissions on the restrictions which necessarily flow from the fight against terrorism are immaterial to the facts of the present case. The application principally concerns torture and inhuman conditions of detention. It involves rights under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention which is absolute, unqualified and non-derogable. There is, therefore, no scope to take into account the political situation in the region concerned.\r\n\r\n      As regards the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention and the derogation under Article 15 (Art. 15), the applicant contested the necessity of a measure permitting detention for as long as 30 days without any of the basic safeguards against abuse, which were deemed to be essential by the Convention organs (Eur. Court H.R., Brannigan and McBride judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258- B, pp. 55-56, paras. 62-66). The applicant submitted that the length of his detention was excessive even by derogation standards.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application as a whole. The Commission concludes, therefore, that the application is not manifestly ill- founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\r\n\r\n      The Commission also considers that, since it has been claimed that the applicant was killed as a result of his complaints to the Commission, it has the task, in the ensuing proceedings, to examine further the circumstances of the applicant's death.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission unanimously\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n      Secretary to the Commission       President of the Commission\r\n\r\n             (H.C.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\n     Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection\r\nof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\n     Having regard to the application introduced on 30 June 1994 by\r\nAbdullah ALTUN against Turkey and registered on 7 July 1994 under file\r\nNo. 24561/94;\r\n\r\n     Having regard to:\r\n\r\n-    the reports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of\r\n     the Commission;\r\n\r\n-    the observations submitted by the respondent Government on\r\n     20 February 1995 and the observations in reply submitted by the\r\n     applicant on 15 May 1995;\r\n\r\n     Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n     Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n     The applicant, a Turkish citizen of Kurdish origin, was born in\r\n1933 and lives at Diyarbakir. He is represented before the Commission\r\nby Professor Kevin Boyle and Ms. Françoise Hampson, both university\r\nteachers at the University of Essex.\r\n\r\n     The facts of the present case, which are in dispute between the\r\nparties, may be summarised as follows.\r\n\r\n     The applicant states that the following occurred.\r\n\r\n     Six houses in the applicant's village Akdoruk, including his\r\nhouse, were burned down by gendarmes. The applicant was not present in\r\nthe village when the burning of his house took place. On his way home\r\nhe met his wife who warned him not to return. She told him that their\r\nhouse had been burned down and that three of their oxen and one ton of\r\ntobacco had also been destroyed. His wife had tried to save household\r\ngoods from the fire but she had been prevented by the gendarmes who had\r\nhit her with the butt of their rifles and had thrown their possessions\r\nback into the blazing house.\r\n\r\n     Later the applicant saw the gendarmes around the village and he\r\nbelieves that they were from Kulp District Gendarme Command which was\r\nstationed about four kilometres from the village.\r\n\r\n     After two days the applicant and his family moved to rented\r\naccommodation in Diyarbakir. He was subsequently informed that the\r\ngendarmes had returned to the village several days after the six houses\r\nhad been destroyed and that on this occasion they had burned down the\r\nrest of the village.\r\n\r\n     In February 1994, some 20 days after moving to Diyarbakir, the\r\napplicant went to Kulp and lodged a petition with the Kulp Domestic\r\nJudge's Office (Sulh Hakimligi) seeking determination of damages for\r\nhis claim to compensation. In the statement he made before the judge\r\nthe applicant said that his village had been burned down and that he\r\nhad suffered damage. He did not say that the Gendarmerie had been\r\nresponsible. Nor did the judge ask who had burned down the village. The\r\njudge then dismissed the applicant and the others who had also lodged\r\npetitions.\r\n\r\n     The applicant later learned that their petitions had been\r\ntransmitted to the Kulp Gendarmerie whose officers the applicant\r\nconsiders as having carried out the destruction of his house and\r\nproperty. He has also learnt that since then members of the Gendarmerie\r\nhave been constantly asking for him. He is however too frightened to\r\ngo to the Gendarmerie headquarters because two other villagers who had\r\npetitioned at the same time as he, had been called to the Kulp\r\nGendarmerie and had been beaten very severely. The Gendarmerie asked\r\nthem nothing about the application for compensation. According to the\r\napplicant, the Gendarmerie refused to record or process his fellow\r\nvillagers' petitions which had been forwarded to them.\r\n\r\n     In his initial application, the applicant submits that the\r\nburning of the six houses occurred on 3 January 1994, which corresponds\r\nto the Kurdistan Human Rights Project's records of villages burnt that\r\nmonth. However, documents submitted by the Government appear to suggest\r\nthat the event under investigation took place on 13 November 1993. It\r\nis submitted on behalf of the applicant that he is over 60 years of age\r\nand that Kurdish peasants do not have an exact sense of time. At\r\npresent further clarification of the date is being sought.\r\n\r\n     The respondent Government state the following.\r\n\r\n     The public prosecutor of the Kulp district commenced a\r\npreliminary investigation into the incident under file no. 1993/159.\r\nOn 22 August 1994, he issued a decision of no jurisdiction and the file\r\nwas transferred to the Kulp District Administrative Board under the\r\nspecial procedure for the prosecution of public officers, where it is\r\nstill pending investigation.\r\n\r\n     A letter of 23 January 1995 from the Kulp Justice Penal Court,\r\nannexed to the Government's observations, states that there is no\r\nrecord of the applicant having made an application for redress in\r\nrelation to the burning of his house.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n     The applicant complains of violations of Articles 3, 5, 6, 8, 13,\r\n14 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 3 the applicant states that the destruction of his\r\nvillage, including his home and possessions, and the assaults on his\r\nwife represent a form of collective punishment and manifest and\r\ndeliberate infliction of inhuman and degrading treatment. Moreover, the\r\ndestruction was discriminatory on grounds of ethnic origin or status\r\nas it was directed against a member of a national minority.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 5 the applicant refers to a breach of his right to\r\nthe exercise of liberty and the enjoyment of security of person. He has\r\nbeen deprived of his freedom of movement and liberty and security of\r\nperson by arbitrary expulsion from his village through a procedure not\r\nsanctioned by Article 5 para. 1, and the expulsion was effected by\r\nmeans of a procedure not prescribed by law.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 6 the applicant complains of having been denied any\r\neffective procedure to challenge or resist the deprivation of his\r\nfreedom to reside in his own home and to pursue his livelihood as a\r\nfarmer, or to receive compensation for his deprivation of possessions.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 8 the applicant refers to a violation of his right\r\nto private life, his home and his family life. He complains of his\r\narbitrary expulsion from the village and of the destruction of his\r\nhome. He points out that the expulsion did not pursue a legitimate aim\r\nunder para. 2 of Article 8.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 13 he alleges that there is no independent national\r\nauthority before which his complaints could be brought with any\r\nprospect of success.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 14 the applicant alleges that he has been\r\ndiscriminated against on the ground of his Kurdish origin in the\r\nenjoyment of his rights under Articles 3, 5, 6, 8 and 13 of the\r\nConvention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 18 he refers to the destruction of his home and\r\nlivestock, his forced abandonment of his village, home and livelihood\r\nfor purposes incompatible with the Convention. He submits that he was\r\narbitrarily forced to leave his property as a punishment because he is\r\na Kurdish civilian and because the Government is engaged in a violent\r\nconflict with armed Kurdish groups. The Government's intention is to\r\nintimidate the applicant and fellow villagers from providing support\r\nor sympathy to the armed opposition forces.\r\n\r\n     As to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the applicant refers to the\r\ndestruction of his house, animals and tobacco crop.\r\n\r\n     The applicant maintains that there is no requirement that he\r\npursue alleged domestic remedies.\r\n\r\n     According to him, any alleged remedy is illusory, inadequate and\r\nineffective because:\r\n\r\na)   the actions of which he complains were officially executed by\r\nagents of the State, namely gendarmes;\r\n\r\nb)   there is an administrative practice of non-respect for the rule\r\nunder Article 13 of the Convention which requires the provision of\r\neffective domestic remedies;\r\n\r\nc)   whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic\r\nremedies are ineffective in this case owing to the failure of the legal\r\nsystem to provide redress;\r\n\r\nd)   whether or not there is an administrative practice, the situation\r\nin South-East Turkey is such that potential applicants have a well-\r\nfounded fear of the consequences, should they invoke alleged remedies.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n     The application was introduced on 30 June 1994 and registered on\r\n7 July 1994.\r\n\r\n     On 11 October 1994 the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the Turkish Government who were invited to submit their\r\nobservations on its admissibility and merits before 4 January 1995.\r\n\r\n     By letter of 27 January 1995 the Commission's Secretary pointed\r\nout to the Government that the period for the submission of the\r\nGovernment's observations had expired and that no extension of that\r\ntime-limit had been requested. It was added that the application was\r\nbeing considered for inclusion in the list of cases for examination by\r\nthe Commission at its February session.\r\n\r\n     Observations were submitted by the Turkish Government on 20\r\nFebruary 1995.\r\n\r\n     On 2 March 1995 the Commission decided to adjourn examination of\r\nthe admissibility and to invite the applicant's representatives to\r\nrespond to the Government's observations before 24 April 1995.\r\n\r\n     Following an extension of this time-limit the applicant submitted\r\nobservations in reply on 15 May 1995.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n     The applicant alleges that a raid was carried out by the security\r\nforces on his village, in the course of which his house and possessions\r\nwere destroyed. He invokes Article 3 (Art. 3) (the prohibition on\r\ninhuman and degrading treatment), Article 5 (Art. 5) (the right to\r\nliberty and security of person), Article 6 (Art. 6) (the right of\r\naccess to court), Article 8 (Art. 8) (the right to respect for family\r\nlife and home), Article 13 (Art. 13) (the right to effective national\r\nremedies for Convention breaches), Article 14 (Art. 14) (the\r\nprohibition on discrimination) and Article 18 (Art. 18) (the\r\nprohibition on using authorised Convention restrictions for ulterior\r\npurposes) of the Convention, as well as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1\r\n(P1-1) (the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions).\r\n\r\n     Exhaustion of domestic remedies\r\n\r\n     The Government argue that the application is inadmissible since\r\nthe applicant has failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by\r\nArticle 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. They contend that the applicant\r\nhas neither applied for indemnity nor complained to the competent\r\njudicial authorities and they point out that there is a pending\r\ninvestigation before the Kulp District Administrative Board.\r\n\r\n     The applicant maintains that there is no requirement that he\r\npursue domestic remedies. He contends that there is no role for him in\r\nthe present stages of the investigation pending before the District\r\nAdministrative Board. In any event, since the applicant has claimed\r\nthat there is an administrative practice of violation of Article 13\r\n(Art. 13) of the Convention and has provided supporting evidence for\r\nsuch a practice, he is not, in his view, required to await the outcome\r\nof the criminal investigation process before complaining to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n     With regard to the Government's assertion that he did not take\r\nany legal action in order to seek compensation for the destruction of\r\nhis possessions, the applicant repeats the detailed account given in\r\nhis original application to the effect that he did do so.\r\n\r\n     The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate\r\nto the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can\r\nprovide effective and sufficient redress. An applicant does not need\r\nto exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to\r\nconstitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing\r\nthe alleged breach. It is furthermore established that the burden of\r\nproving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies\r\nlies upon the State invoking the rule (cf. Eur. Court H.R., De Jong,\r\nBaljet and Van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p.\r\n18, para. 36, and Nos. 14116/88 and 14117/88, Sargin and Yagci v.\r\nTurkey, Dec. 11.05.89, D.R. 61 p. 250, 262).\r\n\r\n     The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether\r\nthere exists an administrative practice on the part of the Turkish\r\nauthorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by\r\nthe applicant, because it agrees with the applicant that it has not\r\nbeen established that he had at his disposal adequate remedies under\r\nthe state of emergency to deal effectively with his complaints.\r\n\r\n     The Commission refers to its findings in Application\r\nNo. 21893/93, Akdivar and others v. Turkey (Dec. 19.10.94) which\r\nconcerned similar allegations by the applicants of destruction of their\r\nvillage and forcible expulsion. In that case, the Commission noted that\r\nit was a known fact that there has been destruction of villages in\r\nSouth-East Turkey with many people displaced as a result. While the\r\nGovernment had outlined a general scheme of remedies that would\r\nnormally be available for complaints against the security forces, the\r\nCommission found it significant that, although the destruction of\r\nhouses and property had been a frequent occurrence in South-East\r\nTurkey, the Government had not provided a single example of\r\ncompensation being awarded to villagers for damage like that suffered\r\nby the applicants. Nor had relevant examples been given of successful\r\nprosecutions against members of the security forces for the destruction\r\nof villages and the expulsion of villagers.\r\n\r\n     The Commission considered that it seemed unlikely that such\r\nprosecutions could follow from acts committed pursuant to the orders\r\nof the Regional Governor under the state of emergency to effect the\r\npermanent or temporary evacuation of villages, to impose residence\r\nprohibitions or to enforce the transfer of people to other areas. It\r\nfurther had regard to the vulnerability of dispossessed applicants,\r\nunder pressure from both the security forces and the terrorist\r\nactivities of the PKK, and held that it could not be said at this stage\r\nthat their fear of reprisal if they complained about acts of the\r\nsecurity forces was wholly without foundation.\r\n\r\n     The Commission concluded that in the absence of clear examples\r\nthat the remedies put forward by the Government would be effective in\r\nthe circumstances of the case, the applicants were absolved from the\r\nobligation to pursue them.\r\n\r\n     In the present case, the Government have not provided any\r\nadditional information which might lead the Commission to depart from\r\nthe above conclusions.\r\n\r\n     While the Government refer to the pending investigation by the\r\nDistrict Administrative Board, the Commission notes that the alleged\r\nevents seem to have occurred in November 1993 and the investigation has\r\nnot yet been concluded. The Commission is not satisfied in view of the\r\ndelays involved that this inquiry can be considered as furnishing an\r\neffective remedy for the purposes of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention. The Commission concludes that this application cannot be\r\nrejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and\r\n27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n     Six months time-limit\r\n\r\n     The Commission has examined whether the applicant has complied\r\nwith the requirement imposed by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention\r\nthat an application must be introduced within six months of the final\r\ndecision taken in respect of the complaints.\r\n\r\n     In the present case, the Commission observes that whereas in his\r\noriginal application the applicant stated that his house was burnt down\r\non 3 January 1994, it appears that the incident under investigation by\r\nthe public prosecutor of Kulp district and the Kulp District\r\nAdministrative Board occurred on 13 November 1993.  The Commission\r\nfound above that the applicant is not required to pursue domestic\r\nremedies in light of their apparent ineffectiveness. In these\r\ncircumstances, the question arises whether the complaints insofar as\r\nthey relate to specific acts carried out on 13 November 1993 have been\r\nintroduced out of time, given that the application was introduced on\r\n30 June 1993.\r\n\r\n     The case-law of the Commission establishes that where no domestic\r\nremedy is available, the six months period runs from the act complained\r\nof (see eg.  No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171). However,\r\nspecial considerations could apply in exceptional cases where an\r\napplicant first avails himself of a domestic remedy and only at a later\r\nstage becomes aware, or should have become aware, of the circumstances\r\nwhich make that remedy ineffective. In such a situation, the six months\r\nperiod might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes\r\naware, or should have become aware, of these circumstances (cf. No.\r\n23654/94, Dec. 15.5.95, Laçin v. Turkey, D.R. 81-B).\r\n\r\n     In this respect the Commission notes that the applicant states\r\nthat he took steps to bring his complaints to the attention of the\r\nauthorities. He claims to have lodged a petition with the Kulp Domestic\r\nJudge's Office in February 1994 in order to obtain compensation. The\r\napplicant submits that this petition has been transmitted to the Kulp\r\nGendarmerie, whose officers the applicant holds responsible for the\r\ndestruction of his house and property. Furthermore, according to the\r\napplicant, the Kulp Gendarmerie has refused to record or process the\r\npetitions of two fellow villagers lodged at the same time as his own\r\npetition with the Kulp Domestic Judge's Office and equally transmitted\r\nto the Kulp Gendarmerie. The applicant further states that he is too\r\nfrightened to go to the Kulp Gendarmerie headquarters because of the\r\nill-treatment allegedly meted out to the two other villagers who had\r\nbeen called there.\r\n\r\n     The Commission observes furthermore that an investigation into\r\nthe incident was initiated in 1993 by the public prosecutor of Kulp\r\ndistrict, which, following the transfer of the file to the Kulp\r\nDistrict Administrative Board in August 1994, has so far not yielded\r\nany results.\r\n\r\n      Given that these circumstances do not disclose any indication\r\nof a delay on the part of the applicant in introducing his application\r\nonce it must have become apparent that no redress for his complaints\r\nwas forthcoming, the Commission considers that the relevant date for\r\nthe purposes of the six months time limit should not be considered to\r\nbe a date earlier than February 1994.\r\n\r\n     It follows that the applicant's complaints have been introduced\r\nwithin the six months time-limit imposed by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n     As to the substance of the applicant's complaints\r\n\r\n     The Government submit that they are unable to submit any\r\nobservations on the merits of the case at the present time.\r\n\r\n     The Commission considers, in the light of the parties'\r\nsubmissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under\r\nthe Convention, the determination of which should depend on an\r\nexamination of the application as a whole. The Commission concludes,\r\ntherefore, that the application is not manifestly ill-founded within\r\nthe meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. No\r\nother grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\r\n\r\n     For these reasons, the Commission, by a majority,\r\n\r\n     DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n     merits of the case.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission             President of the Commission\r\n\r\n       (H.C.

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\n     Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection\r\nof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\n     Having regard to the application introduced on 20 April 1994 by\r\nAhmet AYDER, Yusuf LALEALP, Nadir DOMAN, Sevket BiÇER and Zeydin\r\nEKMEKÇi against Turkey and registered on 9 May 1994 under file\r\nNo. 23656/94;\r\n\r\n     Having regard to:\r\n\r\n-    the reports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of\r\n     the Commission;\r\n\r\n-    the observations and information submitted by the respondent\r\n     Government on 5 December 1994 and 25 January 1995 and the\r\n     observations in reply submitted by the applicant on\r\n     21 February 1995;\r\n\r\n     Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n     Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n     The first applicant, Ahmet Ayder, is a Turkish national of\r\nKurdish origin, born in 1940 and resident at Diyarbakir.\r\n\r\n     The second applicant, Yusuf Lalealp, is a Turkish national of\r\nKurdish origin, born in 1934 and resident at Lice/Diyarbakir.\r\n\r\n     The third applicant, Nadir Doman, is a Turkish national of\r\nKurdish origin, born in 1964 and resident at Diyarbakir.\r\n\r\n     The fourth applicant, Sevket Biçer, is a Turkish national of\r\nKurdish origin, born in 1966 and resident at Diyarbakir.\r\n\r\n     The fifth applicant, Zeydin Ekmekçi, is a Turkish national of\r\nKurdish origin, born in 1963 and resident at Diyarbakir.\r\n\r\n     All the applicants were living in the city of Lice.\r\n\r\n     The applicants state that they are applying on their own behalf\r\nand on behalf of their dependent family members. They are represented\r\nbefore the Commission by Professor Kevin Boyle and Ms. Françoise\r\nHampson, both university teachers at the University of Essex, England.\r\n\r\n     The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nA.   The particular circumstances of the case\r\n\r\n     The applicants give the following account.\r\n\r\n     On 22 October 1993, at around 9h.15, the applicant Biçer was\r\nworking in his vineyard about 2 kilometres from Lice when a military\r\nvehicle passed from the petrol station of Fevzi Çelik, 100 metres from\r\nthe vineyard. There were many soldiers in uniform and two large guns\r\non the vehicle. The applicant Biçer could not see what was happening\r\nin Lice but he assumed that something was about to happen. At exactly\r\n9h.30 he heard gunshots coming from Lice.\r\n\r\n     Three of the other applicants, Ayder, Lalealp and Doman, had gone\r\nto the neighbourhood Saglik café, near their homes. Ayder went there\r\nat about 9h.00 and the other two at 7h.00. Just after 9h.00, gendarmes\r\nand police entered the café with truncheons and firearms and ordered\r\npeople to go to their homes because \"the terrorists had organised an\r\nattack on the Regiment Command\". Lalealp had left the café by that time\r\nand was in the Kortik neighbourhood when that was surrounded by\r\nsoldiers and police and they were told to go to their houses. The\r\nfiring started at around 9h.30.  There were all kinds of weapon noises\r\n(helicopters, rockets, mortars, kalashnikovs etc.). It took Lalealp 25-\r\n30 minutes to reach his home, keeping his head beneath the level of the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Ayder took his children and his wife into the\r\ncellar of the shop adjoining his house. 25-30 other people gathered\r\nthere too.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Lalealp, when he reached home, went with his wife\r\nand four children into the small barn adjoining his house, having put\r\nout their horse. One to two hours later, they were told by the soldiers\r\nto leave the barn. They did so. They heard the sound of a heavy weapon\r\nvery close by. They saw that their house had been set on fire. There\r\nwere innumerable armed, uniformed and plain-clothed soldiers and police\r\nabout. When the Lalealp family appeared, the forces, without saying\r\nanything to them, pointed a wide bore weapon at the barn and fired. The\r\nbarn began to burn furiously. The Lalealp family ran to the barn of the\r\nneighbourhood Mayor.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Doman also went into the small barn adjoining his\r\nhouse, accompanied by his family.\r\n\r\n     The applicants did not believe the explanation they had been\r\ngiven because soldiers, gendarmes and police would not have been all\r\nover the town if an armed clash had taken place. They would have gone\r\ninto shelters or joined in the fighting because the Regiment Command\r\nwas only a few hundred metres from the city centre. Furthermore, the\r\nPKK has never been known to launch attacks during the day. They attack\r\nat night and withdraw.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime, when the firing started, Biçer took refuge in\r\na \"göm\" (a hole big enough for 10 people to shelter in and covered with\r\nsheet iron). He saw six helicopters, three of which were firing in the\r\ndirection of Lice. They were of different kinds, including Cobra,\r\nSikorsky and Apache helicopters. After the weapon was fired, he saw\r\nsmoke rising from where it had landed.\r\n\r\n     On the same day, at around 11h.00, Ekmekçi went to the Lice\r\ngarage in Diyarbakir to return home to Lice, together with his wife and\r\ntwo children. He was told that the Lice road was closed and that there\r\nwas no way in. They tried to ring up their maternal aunt in Lice. They\r\nwere not able to get through until 15h.00. Their aunt answered the\r\ntelephone from the barn. The applicant Ekmekçi could hear the sound of\r\nweapons, gunfire, explosions and of helicopters over the telephone.\r\nThose in Lice said that all they could see were uniformed soldiers and\r\npolice.\r\n\r\n     Those sheltering in Lice had to stay where they were on account\r\nof the firing until the following morning, 23 October at about 8h.00,\r\nwhen the firing stopped.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Biçer tried to leave the \"göm\" at 17h.00 on\r\n22 October, whilst firing was continuing. He took 50-60 steps towards\r\nthe petrol station when soldiers there fired in his direction. He\r\nreturned to the \"göm\". He came out again at 4h.30 on 23 October and set\r\noff towards the petrol station. There were still sounds of firing from\r\nLice. The soldiers fired at him. He went first to another \"göm\" and\r\nthen back to his own. He tried to get to Lice at around 8h.00, when the\r\nfiring died down. He saw that vehicles coming from Diyarbakir were\r\nbeing stopped and no one at all was being allowed into Lice. He\r\nreturned to the \"göm\".\r\n\r\n     All those who had been sheltering in Lice commented on the\r\noverpowering smell of burning when they came out of their shelters.\r\nUniformed soldiers and police were everywhere, pointing weapons at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n     From the front door of his house, the applicant Ayder could see\r\nfive houses which had been burnt down. Someone who seemed to be a\r\nRegiment Commander pointed at Ayder's house and asked whose it was. He\r\nwas holding an M-16 long-barrelled gun. Ayder said that it was his\r\nhouse. He was told to get his family out. He did so. The officer took\r\nsomething in the shape of a half metre long pipe, attached it to a\r\nweapon and fired at the house, which suddenly burst into flames.\r\n\r\n     All those who emerged from shelters in Lice were told to go to\r\nthe open space in front of the Security Directorate. About 2.000 people\r\nwere gradually gathered together there. They were made to wait for\r\nabout four hours for the arrival of the Diyarbakir provincial governor\r\nat around 12h.00-12h.30. The provincial governor said that they were\r\nsheltering terrorists in their homes and that the attack was the work\r\nof those terrorists. If they saw any terrorists they were to telephone\r\nthe authorities. A man of about 40-45 years old stood up and said that\r\nsoldiers and police had caused the destruction. He was taken away and\r\nbrought back a short time later, beaten up. The crowd was told to go\r\nto their homes. Some people whose houses had been burnt by the soldiers\r\nhave not received tents or any other aid from the State. The people\r\nwent to their homes and there was a curfew with immediate effect. The\r\ncurfew lasted until 26 October.\r\n\r\n     On 26 October, the applicant Biçer saw that the road to Lice had\r\nbeen opened. He walked towards Lice. There was a barricade at the\r\nentrance to Lice but they were allowed through. In the town, there were\r\nsheep, goat, cow and donkey carcasses on the ground, swollen up like\r\nballoons. Wheat and straw was burning and smoke rose from burning\r\nhouses. His own house and barn had been burnt, as had his Dutch cow.\r\nThe same day, the applicant Biçer went with his family to the home of\r\nhis brother-in-law in Diyarbakir. They are currently fourteen members\r\nliving in a three-roomed house. The applicant has been unable to find\r\nwork since moving to Diyarbakir. A few days later he returned to Lice\r\nand applied to the prosecutor for a determination of the damages. This\r\nprocedure merely serves to establish what was destroyed when his house\r\nburnt down.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Ayder and his family left Lice in a minibus of the\r\nTurkey Electricity Foundation. They rent a three-roomed house in\r\nDiyarbakir. There are no wage earners in the family. They were only\r\nable to salvage a few bits of furniture. Ayder applied to the\r\nprosecutor for a determination of damage. Ayder states that the\r\nprosecutor said that he would not instigate any inquiry. He told the\r\nprosecutor that it was the soldiers and police who burnt his home, to\r\nwhich the prosecutor responded that he knew that already but that there\r\nwas nothing he could do. The prosecutor said that he would send the\r\ndamage determination report to Ankara.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Doman and his family went to Diyarbakir, to the\r\nhome of a relative, where 25-30 people stayed for two days. Then they\r\nwent to a house belonging to the applicant's father. There are no wage\r\nearners in the family. They applied to the prosecutor for a\r\ndetermination of damage.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Ekmekçi was still in Diyarbakir on 26 October when\r\nthe curfew was lifted. He was joined there by his mother and sister.\r\nOn 30 October, his wife went to Lice. They already knew that their\r\nhouse had been burnt down. A few days later she went back again and\r\napplied to the prosecutor for a determination of damage.\r\n\r\n     The applicant Lalealp did not have the financial means to leave\r\nLice. The family stayed at the house of the Mayor for 20-25 days. They\r\nthen settled in the house of his sister-in-law, who had left Lice. A\r\nmonth after the incident, he applied to the prosecutor for a\r\ndetermination of damage. He was told by Council workers to open a court\r\ncase with the help of the Municipal Council. He did not do so because\r\nhe thought that it would be without effect, since no one has been known\r\nto have achieved any results through any such application. He was not\r\ngiven a copy of the damage determination form. The applicant is too old\r\nto work and there is no work to be found in Lice, whose population has\r\ngone down by half since this incident. He receives help from relatives\r\nliving outside Lice.\r\n\r\n     None of the applicants has received any compensation for the harm\r\nthey were caused or the losses they suffered.\r\n\r\n     The accounts of the applicants are confirmed by the newspaper\r\nreport from Özgür Gündem of 23 October 1993. In particular, all roads\r\nin and out of Lice were sealed off before and during the incident.\r\nPeople were ordered to close shops and businesses and to return home.\r\nThe firing started before they had all had time to do so. Telephone\r\nconnections were cut off at about 13h.30. Many workshops, homes and\r\nvehicles were destroyed. There were some reports of a guerilla counter-\r\noffensive after the firing had started, but the journalists were not\r\nable to confirm that. Guerilla sources were reported as stating that\r\nthere had been no guerilla activity in Lice. Later reports in a number\r\nof newspapers referred to President Demirel stating that the Brigadier\r\nGeneral Aydin was killed by a \"stray bullet\". Other accounts in the\r\npress varied, including the version that he had been killed in the\r\nmountains. Officially, the authorities stated that 13 people had died\r\nin the incident, while local people and some newspapers referred to a\r\nlarger number of deaths and many injured apparently from burns.\r\n\r\n     According to the damage determination report by the public\r\nprosecutor of Lice given to the Human Rights Association in Lice, the\r\nfollowing damage occurred:\r\n\r\n     - 214 shops were damaged, 168 completely;\r\n\r\n     - 18 official buildings were damaged (a municipal service\r\n     building, a depot, a municipal garage and two primary schools\r\n     completely destroyed, the district governor's lodgings, a\r\n     gendarmerie regional building, a commando battalion building and\r\n     police lodgings slightly damaged and the Government palace half-\r\n     damaged);\r\n\r\n     -400 houses were damaged, 297 completely.\r\n\r\n     The respondent Government give the following account.\r\n\r\n     On 22 November 1993, the PKK commenced an armed raid on Lice,\r\ntargeting in particular Government buildings and military headquarters.\r\nThe PKK used heavy weapons and artillery. During the attack, General\r\nBehtiyer Aydin was killed.  Damage to private property occurred mainly\r\nas the result of cross-fire between the PKK and security forces. No\r\ndeliberate damage was carried out by security forces, which in fact\r\ntried to stop the PKK from harming the population and property.\r\n\r\n     Following the incident, the provincial governor distributed tents\r\nand the junior governor, having established the damage, proceeded to\r\nthe necessary repairs.\r\n\r\nB.   Relevant domestic law and practice\r\n\r\n     Civil and administrative procedures\r\n\r\n     Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:\r\n\r\n     (translation)\r\n\r\n     \"All acts or decisions of the Administration are subject to\r\n     judicial review ...\r\n\r\n     The Administration shall be liable for damage caused by its own\r\n     acts and measures.\"\r\n\r\n     The Government assert that this provision is not subject to any\r\nrestrictions even in a state of emergency or war.  The latter\r\nrequirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the\r\nexistence of any fault on the part of the Administration, whose\r\nliability is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a theory of\r\n\"social risk\". Thus the Administration may indemnify people who have\r\nsuffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors\r\nwhen the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain\r\npublic order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life\r\nand property.\r\n\r\n     The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the\r\nadditional Article 1 of Law 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of\r\nEmergency, which provides:\r\n\r\n     (translation)\r\n\r\n     \"... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the\r\n     powers conferred by this law are to be brought against the\r\n     Administration before the administrative courts.\"\r\n\r\n     Proceedings before the administrative courts are in writing.\r\n\r\n     Any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or tort, which\r\ncauses material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for\r\ncompensation before the ordinary civil courts and the administrative\r\ncourts. Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of\r\nthe Social Help and Solidarity Fund.\r\n\r\n     Criminal procedures\r\n\r\n     The Turkish Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence:\r\n\r\n-    to deprive someone unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article 179\r\n     generally, Article 181 in respect of civil servants),\r\n\r\n-    to oblige someone through force or threats to commit or not to\r\n     commit an act (Article 188),\r\n\r\n-    to issue threats (Article 191),\r\n\r\n-    to make an unlawful search of someone's home (Articles 193 and\r\n     194),\r\n\r\n-    to commit arson (Articles 369, 370, 371, 372) or aggravated arson\r\n     if human life is endangered (Article 382),\r\n\r\n-    to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or\r\n     inexperience (Article 383), or\r\n\r\n-    to damage another's property intentionally (Article 526 et seq.).\r\n\r\n     For all these offences, complaints may be lodged, pursuant to\r\nArticles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public\r\nprosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public\r\nprosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported\r\nto them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated,\r\npursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A\r\ncomplainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor\r\nnot to institute criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\n     If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military\r\npersonnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage,\r\nendangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed\r\norders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code.\r\nProceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons\r\nconcerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code\r\nof Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons' hierarchical\r\nsuperior (Articles 93 and 95 of Law 353 on the Constitution and the\r\nProcedure of Military Courts).\r\n\r\n     If the alleged author of a crime is a State official or civil\r\nservant, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local\r\nadministrative councils. The local council decisions may be appealed\r\nto the State Council; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic\r\nappeal of this kind.\r\n\r\n     Emergency measures\r\n\r\n     Articles 13 to 15 of the Constitution provide for fundamental\r\nlimitations on constitutional safeguards.\r\n\r\n     Provisional Article 15 of the Constitution provides that there\r\ncan be no allegation of unconstitutionality in respect of measures\r\ntaken under laws or decrees having the force of law and enacted between\r\n12 September 1980 and 25 October 1983. That includes Law 2935 on the\r\nState of Emergency of 25 October 1983, under which decrees have been\r\nissued which are immune from judicial challenge.\r\n\r\n     Extensive powers have been granted to the Regional Governor of\r\nthe State of Emergency by such decrees, especially Decree 285, as\r\namended by Decrees 424 and 425, and Decree 430.\r\n\r\n     Decree 285 modifies the application of Law 3713, the Anti-Terror\r\nLaw (1981), in those areas subject to the state of emergency, with the\r\neffect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces\r\nis removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local\r\nadministrative councils.\r\n\r\n     Article 8 of Decree 430 of 16 December 1990 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n     (translation)\r\n\r\n     \"No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed\r\n     against the State of Emergency Regional Governor or a Provincial\r\n     Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their\r\n     decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers\r\n     entrusted to them by this decree, and no application shall be\r\n     made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without\r\n     prejudice to the rights of an individual to claim indemnity from\r\n     the State for damages suffered by them without justification.\"\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n     The applicants allege that they have been the victims of the\r\nfollowing violations of the Convention:\r\n\r\nArticle 2\r\n\r\n1.   A violation of Article 2 on account of the life-threatening\r\nattack to which they were subjected by agents of the State.\r\n\r\n2.   Alternatively, a violation of Article 2 on account of the threat\r\nto life occasioned by gross recklessness on the parts of agents of the\r\nState, in violation of the State's obligation to protect their right\r\nto life.\r\n\r\n3.   A violation of Article 2 on account of the lack of any effective\r\nsystem for ensuring protection of the right to life.\r\n\r\n4.   A violation of Article 2 on account of the inadequate protection\r\nof the right to life in domestic law.\r\n\r\n5.   A violation of Article 14 in conjunction with each head of claim\r\nunder Article 2.\r\n\r\nArticle 3\r\n\r\n6.   A violation of Article 3 on account of an inhuman and degrading\r\ntreatment whilst firing was going on, in front of the Security\r\nDirectorate and whilst they were subject to the curfew. This represents\r\na form of collective punishment which is, in itself, in violation of\r\nArticle 3.\r\n\r\n7.   A violation of Article 14, in conjunction with Article 3.\r\n\r\n8.   A violation of Article 3 on account of discrimination on grounds\r\nof race or ethnic origin.\r\n\r\nArticle 5\r\n\r\n9.   A violation of Article 5 on account of complete lack of security\r\nof the person.\r\n\r\nArticle 6\r\n\r\n10.  A violation of Article 6 on account of the impossibility of\r\nchallenging the deprivation of property before it took place, which\r\nrepresents a denial of access to court for a determination of civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n11.  A violation of Article 6 on account of the failure to initiate\r\nproceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal against those\r\nresponsible for the life-threatening attacks and destruction of\r\nproperty, as a result of which they cannot bring civil proceedings out\r\nof the attack and destruction.\r\n\r\nArticle 8\r\n\r\n12.  A violation of Article 8 on account of the destruction of the\r\nhomes of the applicants.\r\n\r\nArticle 1 of Protocol 1\r\n\r\n13.  A violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 on account of the\r\ndestruction of the applicants' homes and possessions.\r\n\r\nArticle 14\r\n\r\n14.  A violation of Article 14, in conjunction with Articles 5, 6 and\r\n8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1 on account of an\r\nadministrative practice of discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nArticle 13\r\n\r\n15.   A violation of Article 13 on account of the lack of any\r\nindependent national authority before which these complaints can be\r\nbrought with any prospect of success.\r\n\r\nArticle 18\r\n\r\n16. A violation of Article 18 because the interferences in the exercise\r\nof the Convention rights are not designed to secure the ends permitted\r\nunder the Convention.\r\n\r\nAs regards Article 26\r\n\r\n     The applicants maintain that there is no requirement that they\r\npursue alleged domestic remedies. According to them, any alleged remedy\r\nis illusory, inadequate and ineffective because\r\n\r\na)   the operation which led to the threat of life and destruction in\r\nquestion in this case was officially organised, planned and executed\r\nby agents of the State;\r\n\r\nb)   there is an administrative practice of not respecting the rule\r\nunder Article 13 of the Convention which requires the provision of\r\neffective domestic remedies;\r\n\r\nc)   whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic\r\nremedies are ineffective in this case owing to the failure of the legal\r\nsystem to provide redress;\r\n\r\nd)   alternatively, the applicants have done everything they can to\r\nexhaust domestic remedies by obtaining a determination of damage; the\r\nfact that none of them has received any compensation or assistance\r\nconfirms the ineffectiveness of any alleged remedy.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n     The application was introduced on 20 April 1994 and registered\r\non 9 May 1994.\r\n\r\n     On 27 June 1994, the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the Government and to ask for written observations on\r\nthe admissibility and merits of the case.\r\n\r\n     The Government's observations were submitted on 5 December 1994\r\nafter one extension in the time-limit set for that purpose. The\r\nGovernment submitted supplementary observations on 25 January 1995. The\r\napplicant's observations in reply were submitted on 21 February 1995.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n     The applicants complain that the security forces carried out a\r\nlife-threatening attack on their town during which their homes and\r\nproperty were burnt and destroyed. They invoke Article 2 (Art. 2) (the\r\nright to life), Article 3 (Art. 3) (the prohibition on inhuman and\r\ndegrading treatment), Article 5 (Art. 5) (the right to liberty and\r\nsecurity of person),  Article 6 (Art. 6) (the right of access to\r\ncourt), Article 8 (Art. 8) (the right to respect for family life and\r\nthe home), Article 13 (Art. 13) (the right to effective national\r\nremedies for Convention breaches), Article 14 (Art. 14) (prohibition\r\non discrimination) and Article 18 (Art. 18) (the prohibition on using\r\nauthorised Convention restrictions for ulterior purposes) of the\r\nConvention, as well as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the\r\nConvention (the right to property).\r\n\r\n     Exhaustion of domestic remedies\r\n\r\n     The Government argue that the application is inadmissible since\r\nthe applicants have failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by\r\nArticle 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n     In respect of damage alleged to have been caused by the State or\r\nits agents, the Government submit that the applicants had the\r\npossibility of introducing an action for compensation before the civil\r\nor administrative courts relying, inter alia, on Article 125 of the\r\nTurkish Constitution or Article 8 of Decree 430 of 16 December 1990.\r\n\r\n     The Government also submit that alleged arson, destruction of\r\nproperty and threatening conduct are prohibited by the Criminal Code,\r\nin respect of which complaints could be lodged with the competent\r\nauthorities, civil or military.\r\n\r\n     The applicants maintain that there is no requirement that they\r\npursue domestic remedies. Any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate\r\nand ineffective since, inter alia, the operation in question in this\r\ncase was officially organised, planned and executed by agents of the\r\nState and having regard, inter alia, to the situation in South-East\r\nTurkey which is such that potential applicants have a well-founded fear\r\nof the consequences if they should pursue remedies. In this context the\r\napplicants also allege a lack of genuine investigations by public\r\nprosecutors and other competent authorities; the absence of any cases\r\nshowing the payment of adequate compensation to villagers for the\r\ndestruction of their homes and villages, or for their expulsion; an\r\nofficial attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces\r\nand the lack of any prosecutions against members of the security forces\r\nfor the alleged offences connected with the destruction of villages and\r\nforcible expulsions. There is, in the applicants' view, an\r\nadministrative practice of ineffective remedies.\r\n\r\n     The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate\r\nto the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can\r\nprovide effective and sufficient redress.  An applicant does not need\r\nto exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to\r\nconstitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing\r\nthe alleged breach. It is furthermore established that the burden of\r\nproving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies\r\nlies upon the State invoking the rule (cf. Eur. Court H.R., De Jong,\r\nBaljet and Van den Brink judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, p.\r\n18, para. 36, and Nos. 14116/88 and 14117/88, Sargin and Yagci v.\r\nTurkey, Dec. 11.05.89, D.R. 61 p. 250, 262).\r\n\r\n     The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether\r\nthere exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish\r\nauthorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by\r\nthe applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not\r\nbeen established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies\r\nunder the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints.\r\n\r\n     As regards the allegations with regard to the destruction of the\r\napplicants' homes and property, the Commission refers to its findings\r\nin Application No. 21893/93, Akdivar and others v. Turkey (Dec.\r\n19.10.94) which concerned similar complaints of the destruction of\r\nhomes and forcible expulsion. In that case, the Commission noted that\r\nit was a known fact that there had been destruction of villages in\r\nSouth-East Turkey with many people displaced as a result. While the\r\nGovernment had outlined a general scheme of remedies that would\r\nnormally be available for complaints against the security forces, the\r\nCommission found it significant that, although the destruction of\r\nhouses and property has been a frequent occurrence in South-East\r\nTurkey, the Government had not provided a single example of\r\ncompensation being awarded to villagers for damage like that suffered\r\nby the applicants. Nor had relevant examples been given of successful\r\nprosecutions against members of the security forces for the destruction\r\nof villages and the expulsion of villagers.\r\n\r\n     The Commission considered that it seemed unlikely that such\r\nprosecutions could follow from acts committed pursuant to the orders\r\nof the Regional Governor under the state of emergency to effect the\r\npermanent or temporary evacuation of villages, to impose residence\r\nprohibitions or to enforce the transfer of people to other areas. It\r\nfurther had regard to the vulnerability of dispossessed applicants,\r\nunder pressure from both the security forces and the terrorist\r\nactivities of the PKK, and held that it could not be said at this stage\r\nthat their fear of reprisal if they complained about acts of the\r\nsecurity forces was wholly without foundation.\r\n\r\n     The Commission concluded that, in the absence of clear examples\r\nthat the remedies put forward by the Government would be effective in\r\nthe circumstances of the case, the applicants were absolved from the\r\nobligation to pursue them.\r\n\r\n     In the present case, the Government have not provided any\r\nadditional information which might lead the Commission to depart from\r\nthe above conclusions in respect of remedies available for the\r\ndestruction of homes and property in villages and towns.\r\n\r\n     The Commission concludes that this application cannot be rejected\r\nfor non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and 27 para.\r\n3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n     As regards the merits\r\n\r\n     The Government submit that security forces were in operation in\r\nLice on 22 October 1993 in response to an attack on the town by the PKK\r\nwho were using heavy weapons and artillery. No deliberate damage was\r\ninflicted on the houses in the town by the soldiers.\r\n\r\n     The applicants maintain their account of events that the attack\r\non the town was planned and carried out by the security forces alone,\r\nand that the PKK were not involved.\r\n\r\n     The Commission considers, in the light of the parties'\r\nsubmissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under\r\nthe Convention, the determination of which should depend on an\r\nexamination of the merits of the application as a whole. The Commission\r\nconcludes, therefore, that the application is not manifestly ill-\r\nfounded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n     For these reasons, the Commission, unanimously,\r\n\r\n     DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n     merits of the case.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission              President of the Commission\r\n\r\n        (H.C.

He is represented by Mr. J. Wadham of Liberty (previously known as the National Council for Civil Liberties), London.\r\n\r\n      On 21 August 1990 the Poole Magistrates' Court ordered the issue of a liability order in respect of the applicant's unpaid community charge (poll tax).\r\n\r\n      On 25 March 1991, in answer to a summons,  the applicant appeared at the Poole Magistrates' Court for an inquiry to be made into his means and the reasons for his failure to pay the poll tax.  The applicant, who was not represented, gave evidence that\r\n\r\n      (a) he had left the Government Employment Training Scheme in\r\n      March 1990 and that he had not had gainful employment since then;\r\n\r\n      (b) he had applied for Income Support but had been refused;\r\n\r\n      (c) he had no personal assets or income.\r\n\r\n      On the basis of this evidence (which was accepted as true), the\r\nMagistrates concluded that the applicant's failure to pay the community charge was due to his culpable neglect \"as he clearly had the potential to earn money to discharge his obligation to pay\".  They issued a warrant committing the applicant to prison for 30 days.\r\n\r\n      On 28 March 1991 a solicitor, who was informed about the facts, appeared (without payment) before the same bench of the Magistrates'\r\nCourt and applied for bail on the applicant's behalf, but this was refused.  The solicitor also lodged an appeal by way of case stated and an application for bail pending appeal.  Moreover he applied for and obtained an emergency legal aid certificate to pursue the appeal.\r\n\r\n      As the High Court is not seized of an appeal by way of case stated until the Magistrates' Court has actually stated a case and it has been lodged in the High Court, on 4 April 1991 the solicitor lodged a further application in the High Court for judicial review of the Magistrates' Court's decision, as this would allow for an immediate bail application.\r\n\r\n      On 5 April 1991 the application for bail was heard before a High Court judge and the applicant was granted bail, while on 16 April 1991 leave to apply for judicial review was also granted.\r\n\r\n      On 7 and 8 October 1991, the High Court heard the two applications, that is, the appeal by way of case stated and the application for judicial review.  The applicant was represented and had legal aid for the appeals.\r\n\r\n      On 8 October 1991 the High Court answered in the negative the following three questions put by the Magistrates' Court:\r\n\r\n           \"(1) Whether the following findings of fact can be\r\n           supported by the evidence before us, namely that the\r\n           appellant's failure to pay which led to the liability order\r\n           being made was due to his culpable neglect.\r\n\r\n           (2) Whether, before issuing the said warrant, we conducted\r\n           an adequate inquiry into the appellant's means.\r\n\r\n           (3) Whether we acted reasonably in exercising our\r\n           discretion to issue the said warrant\".\r\n\r\n      In connection with these questions, the High Court found:\r\n\r\n      \"In certain circumstances a failure on the part of the debtor to work and put himself in funds to pay the Community Charge might constitute culpable neglect.  In my judgment however, before such a finding could be sustained, at the very least there would have to be clear evidence that gainful employment, for which he was fit, was on offer to the debtor and that he had rejected or refused that offer.  There was no such evidence in this case. In my judgment, the justices' findings of culpable neglect cannot be sustained on the evidence adduced before them. ... In the present case the justices found that the applicant had no income and no assets at the time that he appeared before them, that being the relevant time for them when considering whether they should issue a warrant so as to commit the appellant to prison. In my judgment it was incumbent upon them to consider the alternatives to an immediate commitment to prison.\"\r\n\r\n      The appeal was allowed and the first instance order was set aside.\r\n\r\n      Relevant domestic law and practice\r\n\r\n      Regulation 41 of the Community Charges (Administration and\r\nEnforcement) Regulations 1989 provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"41. (1)   Where a charging authority had sought to levy an\r\n      amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an\r\n      individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or\r\n      insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy\r\n      the amount, the authority may apply to a Magistrates' Court for\r\n      the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.\r\n\r\n      41. (2)    On such application being made, the court shall (in\r\n      the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire\r\n      whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order\r\n      concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal\r\n      or culpable neglect.\r\n\r\n      41. (3)    If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his\r\n      failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may\r\n      if it thinks fit - (a) issue a warrant of commitment against the\r\n      debtor, or (b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue\r\n      of a warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as\r\n      the court thinks just.\"\r\n\r\n      In Re McC the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords held that\r\nMagistrates acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction and would be liable in damages where an individual could show that the Magistrates had no jurisdiction over the cause at all, that they exercised their powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity, or that the order of the court was not based on any proper foundation of law because of failure to observe a statutory condition precedent ([1985] AC 528).\r\n\r\n      In a case concerning rates, the predecessor to the community charge (R. v. Manchester City Magistrates Court, ex parte Davies [1989] All ER 30), the Court of Appeal found that where Magistrates failed to make proper inquiry as to whether failure to pay rates was due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect, they had failed to observe a statutory condition precedent and therefore acted outside or in excess\r\nof their jurisdiction.  The Magistrates were therefore liable in damages for the applicant's unlawful imprisonment.\r\n\r\n      On 1 January 1991 Section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 entered into force.  The Act replaces Sections 44 and 45 of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 providing, inter alia, that an action only lies against a Justice of the Peace (Magistrate) who acts beyond jurisdiction if, and only if, it is proved that he acted in bad faith.\r\n\r\n      Neither the civil nor the criminal legal aid scheme provides for full representation before the Magistrates for proceedings for commitment to prison for non-payment of the community charge.  The \"Green Form\" scheme provides two hours' worth of help from a solicitor, and can include preparation for a court case, but does not provide for representation. An extension of the costs limit can be granted by the\r\nLegal Aid Board. Assistance by way of Representation (\"ABWOR\") enables the court, in certain circumstances, to a appoint a solicitor who happens to be within the court precincts for the purposes other than the provision of ABWOR to represent a party who would not otherwise be presented.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention in that he was unlawfully detained by the Magistrates, who acted beyond their jurisdiction (cf. R. v. Manchester City Magistrates\r\nCourt, ex parte Davies).\r\n\r\n      As a result of the amendment to the law brought about by Section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, no action lies against Magistrates in respect of such unlawful detention.  The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention in this respect.\r\n\r\n      Under Article 6 of the Convention, the applicant considers that, regardless of whether the proceedings are civil or criminal, he should have been entitled to legal aid before the Magistrates.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 20 September 1991 and registered on 21 January 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 12 October 1992 the Commission decided to communicate the application to the respondent Government and to ask for written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 17 February 1993 and the applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 13 May 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 8 April 1993, the Commission decided to grant legal aid to the applicant.\r\n\r\n      On 30 August 1993, the Commission decided to hold an oral hearing.\r\n\r\n      At the oral hearing, which was held on 13 January 1994, the parties were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government:\r\n\r\nMrs. A.F. Glover                 Agent, Foreign and Commonwealth Office\r\nMr.  D. Pannick, Q.C.            Counsel\r\nMs.  A. Jenkins                  Adviser, Lord Chancellor's Department\r\nMs.  E. Hutchinson               Adviser, Lord Chancellor's Department\r\n\r\nFor the applicant:\r\n\r\nMr.  B. Emmerson                 Counsel\r\nMr.  J. Wadham                   Legal director of Liberty\r\n\r\n      At the hearing, the Government withdrew an argument that the applicant could have brought an action against the Governor of the prison at which he was being held.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention in that his detention was neither \"in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\", nor \"lawful\" in domestic law, within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (a) or (b)(Art. 5-1-a, 5-1-b), and that none of the other sub-paragraphs applies.\r\n\r\n      Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No\r\n      one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases\r\n      and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\r\n\r\n      (a)  the lawful detention of a person convicted by a competent\r\n      court;\r\n\r\n      (b)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-\r\n      compliance with the lawful order of a court or in order to secure\r\n      the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;...\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant notes that in its judgment in the present case the Divisional Court answered the Magistrates' questions, \"Whether before issuing the ... warrant, (they) conducted an adequate inquiry into the appellant's means\", and \"Whether the following finding of fact can be supported by the evidence before the Magistrates' Court, namely that the applicant's failure to pay which led to the liability order being made was due to his culpable neglect\", in the negative. He submits that the present case cannot be distinguished from the R. v. Manchester City Magistrates' Court ex parte Davies case, and that the detention was unlawful both in domestic and in Convention terms.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the Magistrates made an error of law within their jurisdiction which has been corrected on appeal. They rely on the absence of any suggestion in the High Court's judgment that the applicant's detention was unlawful.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has taken cognizance of the parties' submissions. After a preliminary examination of the complaints under Article 5 para. 1 (a) and (b) (Art. 5-1-a, 5-1-b) of the Convention, the Commission finds that they raise complex issues of fact and law which must be examined on the merits. This part of the application cannot therefore be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of\r\nArticle 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. No other grounds for inadmissibility have been established.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant also complains under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention that he had no right to compensation under domestic law for his allegedly unlawful detention.\r\n\r\n      Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in\r\n      contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an\r\n      enforceable right to compensation.\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that the effect of Section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1991 is to deprive him of the remedy to which he had previously been entitled. The Government submit that the question does not arise as there is no violation of any provision of Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention the right to compensation is conditional on a breach of one of the paragraphs of Article 5 (Art. 5). The Commission has declared admissible the applicant's complaints under Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention. It finds that the question whether the applicant's right under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention was violated also raises complex issues of fact and law, which require further examination on the merits.\r\n\r\n      This part of the application can therefore also not be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. No other grounds for inadmissibility have been established.\r\n\r\n3.    Finally, the applicant complains that legal aid was not available to him in the Magistrates' Court.  He alleges a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention provides, so far as relevant, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or\r\n      of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a\r\n      fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an\r\n      independent and impartial tribunal established by law...\r\n\r\n      3.  Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following\r\n      minimum rights:\r\n\r\n      (c)   to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of\r\n      his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for\r\n      legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of\r\n      justice so require.\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that, although domestic law categorises the proceedings at issue in the present case as civil, both the nature of the proceedings and the actual penalty imposed indicate that a criminal charge was in fact determined. He considers that, whatever the nature of the proceedings, they were so complex as to require proper legal representation, especially regarding the alternatives to immediate imprisonment. He submits that there was no adequate provision for representation before the Magistrates.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the proceedings were not criminal.\r\nThey further consider that the committal proceedings themselves did not determine the applicant's civil rights and obligations, but were merely execution of the civil judgment brought about by the liability order in the case.  They submit that the combined effect of assistance under the Green Form scheme and ABWOR complies with the requirements of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention, even if this Convention provision applies to the proceedings.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that this complaint also raises complex issues of fact and law which must be examined on the merits. This part of the application cannot therefore be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention either. No other grounds for inadmissibility have been established.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission, by a majority\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n      merits.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission                 President of the Commission\r\n\r\n      (H.C. KRÜGER)                                (C.A. NØRGAARD)\r\n\r\n",

The particular circumstances of the case\r\n\r\n      The applicant is a British citizen born in 1964 and resident in Willingham. She is represented before the Commission by Mr. Luke Clements, a solicitor practising in Hereford.\r\n\r\n      The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows.\r\n\r\n      The applicant is a gypsy by birth. Her family has for many generations been based in the area of South Cambridgeshire near Willingham. Until 1988, the applicant had no fixed abode but travelled in caravans throughout the Willingham area.\r\n\r\n      In 1988 Mr. and Mrs. Buckley (who is the applicant's sister) acquired a one acre site in the Willingham area from a Mr. and Mrs. S., who had applied for and been refused, retrospective planning permission for a single caravan.  In May 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Buckley applied retrospectively for planning permission to have one residential caravan on the frontage of their one acre site.  Permission was given on a personal temporary basis.  In November 1988, a further retrospective application was made for three caravans.  These were occupied by the applicant and her three children.  Permission was given in January 1989 on a personal temporary basis.\r\n\r\n      On an unspecified date in 1988, the applicant acquired part of the land belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Buckley.  In October 1989 on the part of the land acquired by the applicant, there were three caravans occupied by the applicant, her children and her mother. A retrospective planning application in respect of the three caravans was submitted on 4 December 1989.  While it was under consideration the fourth caravan occupied by the applicant's brother moved on to the site.  The application was refused by the District Council on 8 March 1990 on the basis that adequate provision had been made for gypsy caravans elsewhere, that the planned use of the land would detract from the rural and open quality of the landscape and that the access to the site was too narrow to allow two vehicles to pass.\r\n\r\n      An enforcement notice was issued by the District Council for the caravans to be removed to take effect on 15 May 1990.\r\n\r\n      The applicant appealed against the enforcement notice to the\r\nSecretary of State for the Environment.\r\n\r\n      In a decision dated 16 April 1991 based on an inspector's report, the Secretary of State dismissed the appeal, finding that the objections to the continued use of the site for caravans were so strong on planning and highway safety grounds that the grant of permission could not be justified. He found also that the concentration of gypsy sites in the area had reached the desirable maximum and the need for additional sites for gypsies should not outweigh the planning and highway objections. The inspector also referred to the fact that the applicant had planning permission to station a caravan on an adjoining approved site.\r\n\r\n      The applicant did not appeal to the High Court since this appeal lies only on points of law and she was advised that no grounds arose in her case.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was served with a summons for failure to comply with the enforcement notice on 9 September 1991. At the hearing in the Magistrates' Court on 7 January 1992, the applicant pleaded guilty on the advice of her solicitor and was fined £50 with £10 costs. The applicant has not moved and another enforcement notice is imminent.\r\n\r\n      By letter dated 20 May 1993, the Department of the Environment informed the District Council that the Secretary of State had decided to designate the area of South Cambridgeshire under section 12 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968. Designation was granted on the basis of the Council's assurance that they will apply their powers humanely and give sympathetic consideration to applications for gypsy sites. It was noted that a small number of gypsies still remained on unauthorised sites but that, in light of the provision made for sites which is greater than in any other district, it was considered \"not expedient for adequate accommodation to be provided for gypsies residing in or resorting to\r\nSouth Cambridgeshire District\".\r\n\r\n      The Order designating the district of South Cambridgeshire came into force on 13 August 1993.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was prosecuted for breach of an enforcement notice on 12 January 1994. The magistrates' court granted her an absolute discharge but ordered her to pay the prosecuting expenses.\r\n\r\nb.    Relevant domestic law and practice\r\n\r\nProvision for gypsy sites\r\n\r\n      Section 16 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (the 1968 Act) defines \"gipsies\" as:\r\n\r\n      \"persons of nomadic habit of life, whatever their race or origin,\r\n      but does not include members of an organised group of travelling\r\n      showmen, or of persons engaged on travelling circuses, travelling\r\n      together as such.\"\r\n\r\n      Section 6 of the 1968 Act provides that it shall be the duty of local authorities:\r\n\r\n      \"... to exercise their powers...so far as may be necessary to\r\n      provide adequate accommodation for gipsies residing in or\r\n      resorting to their area.\"\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to section 9 of the 1968 Act, the Secretary of State may direct local authorities to provide sites:\r\n\r\n      \"The Secretary of State may, if at any time it appears to him to\r\n      be necessary so to do, give directions to any local authority to\r\n      which subsection 1 of section 6 of this Act applies requiring\r\n      them to provide pursuant to that section, such sites or\r\n      additional sites, for the accommodation of such numbers of\r\n      caravans, as may be specified in the directions; and any such\r\n      directions shall be enforceable, on the application of the\r\n      Secretary of State, by mandamus.\"\r\n\r\n      The Secretary of State has made directions to a local authority under section 9 on five occasions. No application has ever been made to the courts to enforce any such directions.\r\n\r\nThe designation system\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to Section 12 of the 1968 Act, where the Secretary of\r\nState is satisfied that the duty imposed by Section 6 has been carried out, he may designate the area of that local authority as one to which \r\n\r\nSection 10 applies.\r\n\r\n      Section 10 of the 1968 Act provides :\r\n\r\n      \"Prohibition of unauthorised camping in designated areas\r\n\r\n      (1) In any area designated under the following provisions of this\r\n      Act as an area to which this section applies it shall be an\r\n      offence for any person being a gipsy to station a caravan for the\r\n      purpose of residing for any period -\r\n\r\n           (a)   on any land situated within the boundaries of a\r\n                 highway; or\r\n           (b)   on any other unoccupied land; or\r\n           (c)   on any occupied land without the consent of the\r\n                 occupier.\r\n\r\n      (2) In proceedings against any person for an offence under this\r\n      section it shall be a defence to prove that the caravan was\r\n      stationed on the land in consequence of illness, mechanical\r\n      breakdown or other immediate emergency and that he removed it (or\r\n      intended to remove it) as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\n\r\n      (3) A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be\r\n      liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding [level 1 on\r\n      the standard scale]; and if the offence of which he is convicted\r\n      is continued after the conviction he shall be guilty of a further\r\n      offence and shall be liable in respect thereof to a fine not\r\n      exceeding £5 for every day on which the offence is so continued.\"\r\n\r\n      Section 11 of the Act provides:\r\n\r\n      \"Orders for removal of unlawfully parked caravans and their\r\n      occupants\r\n\r\n      (1) In any area to which section 10 of this Act applies, a\r\n      magistrates' court may, on a complaint made by a local authority,\r\n      and if satisfied that a caravan is stationed on land within the\r\n      authority's area in contravention of that section, make an order\r\n      requiring any caravan (whether or not identified in the order)\r\n      which is so stationed on the land to be removed together with any\r\n      person residing in it.\r\n\r\n      (2) An order under this section may authorise the local authority\r\n      to take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that the\r\n      order is complied with and in particular, may authorise the\r\n      authority, by its officers and servants -\r\n\r\n           (a)   to enter upon the land specified in the order; and\r\n           (b)   to take, in relation to any caravan to be removed\r\n                 pursuant to the order, such steps for securing entry\r\n                 and rendering it suitable for removal as may be so\r\n                 specified ...\"\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that she and her family are being prevented from living in her caravans on her own land and from following the traditional lifestyle of a gypsy. She refers to the designation system which penalises gypsies and to the lack of official sites for gypsies to resort to. She complains of a violation of her rights under Article 8 of the Convention.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 7 February 1992 and registered\r\non 22 July 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 8 January 1993, the Commission decided to communicate the application to the Government and to ask for written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 8 April 1993 and the applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 1 June 1993 after one extension in the time-limit.\r\n\r\n      On  5 July 1993, the Commission decided to grant legal aid to the applicant.\r\n\r\n      The applicant obtained legal representation and further observations were submitted on her behalf on 8 October 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 1 December 1993, the Commission decided to hold an oral hearing.\r\n\r\n      On 14 February 1994, the applicant made further written submissions. The Government submitted further material on the same date.\r\n\r\n      At the oral hearing which took place before the First Chamber on\r\n3 March 1994, the parties were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government\r\n\r\nMr. Iain Christie                      Agent\r\nMr. David Pannick, Q.C.                Counsel\r\n\r\nMs. Virginia Harrison, Miss Pauline Prosser and Ms. Jan Bird as\r\nAdvisers from the Department of the Environment.\r\n\r\nFor the applicant\r\n\r\nMr. Timothy Jones                      Counsel\r\nMs. Perdita Cargill-Thompson           Counsel\r\nMr. Luke Clements                      Solicitor\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that she is prevented from living with her family in caravans on her land and from pursuing her traditional way of life as a gypsy. She invokes Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which provides:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and\r\n      family life, his home and his correspondence.\r\n\r\n      2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with\r\n      the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with\r\n      the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests\r\n      of national security, public safety or the economic well-being\r\n      of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the\r\n      protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the\r\n      rights and freedoms of others.\"\r\n\r\n      Insofar as the applicant complains of the alleged shortfall of official sites for gypsies in the Willingham area, the Government submit that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention since she has not applied to the Secretary of State to exercise his power under section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to direct a local authority to comply with its statutory duty to provide such sites and if necessary, to enforce such directions in the courts.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits there are no effective remedies which she is obliged to exhaust. The Secretary of State's power under section 9 is, she contends, discretionary and rarely exercised.\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.  An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (cf. No. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78).\r\n\r\n      It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the State invoking the rule (cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec. 11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102).\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that in the context of the section 9 powers the Secretary of State has a very wide discretion. It appears that he has only exercised his discretion under section 9 in five cases and that there is no example of any enforcement of those directions being pursued in the courts. The Commission recalls that in the case of\r\nTemple v. the United Kingdom (No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171) the Commission held that recourse to a purely discretionary power on the part of the Secretary of State did not constitute an effective domestic remedy.  The Commission finds that the suggested application for discretionary relief in the instant case cannot do so either.  In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\r\n\r\n      The Government contend that the applicant cannot be considered a victim of any violation of her rights under Article 8 paragraph 1 (Art. 8-1) since as a matter of fact she was and is able to live either on the neighbouring land lawfully occupied by her sister or to apply for a place on one of the many other local authority and private gipsy caravan sites throughout Cambridgeshire. She also has not been subject to any of the criminal sanctions which may applied under the designation system. Further, they point out that applicant took up residence on her land without prior planning permission. They consider that the applicant cannot claim as a member of a minority group to be immune from general planning control.\r\n\r\n      To the extent that there might have been any interference with her rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1), the Government consider that the refusal of planning permission and issue of the enforcement notices are justified by the interests of public safety on the road, the economic well-being of the country and the protection of the environment. As for the framework of regulation, including the designation system, this is stated to represent a proportionate response to the need to protect public safety on the roads as well as the rights of others.\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains of a violation of her right to respect for her family life, private life and home under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. She complains that she is prohibited from living on her own land where her children can grow up in a stable environment and receive a continuous education and that she is also prevented from pursuing the traditional lifestyle of a gypsy. She submits that there is an acknowledged shortfall of sites for gypsies in South Cambridgeshire and that local authorities are failing to fulfil their statutory duty to provide sites.\r\n\r\n      The applicant also contends that it is a practical impossibility for her to station her caravans on her sister's site and that even if there were vacant pitches on the nearby official site, it is overcrowded and has a reputation for violence which renders it an unsafe location for a single woman living alone with her children.\r\nFurther, the designation system which discriminates against gypsies prevents her moving onto unoccupied land or stationing her caravans near the highway. As a result, the applicant contends that she has nowhere she can legally or safely go.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the parties. It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. It follows that the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission by a majority\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the First Chamber   President of the First Chamber\r\n\r\n      (M.F.

He is represented before the Commission by Mr. Peter Snow, Honorary Legal Officer of the Campaign for Justice in Divorce.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the present case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows:\r\n\r\nA.    The particular circumstances of the case\r\n\r\n      The applicant refers to the summary of the facts, which gave rise to his application, made by the Court of Appeal in his case:\r\n\r\n      \"(The applicant) married his wife on 11 August 1984.  They had one son, who was born in 1985.  On 11 November 1987 the parties separated for a period of about two weeks before becoming reconciled.\r\n\r\n      On 21 October 1989, as a result of further matrimonial difficulties, the wife left the matrimonial home with their son, who was then aged four, and returned to live with her parents. She had by this time already consulted solicitors regarding her matrimonial affairs and indeed had left a letter for (the applicant) in which she informed him that she intended to petition for divorce.  However no legal proceedings had been taken by her before the incident took place which gave rise to these criminal proceedings.  It seems that (the applicant) had on 23 October spoken to his wife by telephone indicating that it was his intention also to 'see about a divorce'.\r\n\r\nShortly before 9 o'clock on the evening of 12 November 1989, that is to say some 22 days after the wife had returned to live with her parents, and while the parents were out, (the applicant) forced his way into the parents' house and attempted to have sexual intercourse with the wife against her will.  In the course of that attempt he assaulted her, in particular by squeezing her neck with both hands.\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant was charged with rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  At his trial before the Leicester Crown Court on 30 July 1990 it was submitted that the charge of rape was one which was not known to the law by reason of the fact that the applicant was the husband of the alleged victim.  The submission was based on the pronouncement of the common law made by Sir Matthew Hale in his \"History of the Pleas of the Crown\", p. 629, published in 1736:\r\n\r\n\"But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.\"\r\n\r\n      The trial judge, Owen J., ruled that the charge could go to the jury. He found, inter alia, that there was sufficient evidence to indicate an implied agreement to a separation and a withdrawal of consent. He also considered that the common law recognised an exception to the concept of marital immunity where there has been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, and that there was again sufficient evidence to indicate that this exception applied. The applicant then pleaded guilty to attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.  He appealed.\r\n\r\n      The Court of Appeal held on 14 March 1991 as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Since the rule that a husband could not be guilty of raping his wife if he forced her to have sexual intercourse against her will was an anachronistic and offensive common law fiction which no longer represented the position of a wife in present-day society, it should no longer be applied.  Instead, the principle to be applied was that a rapist remained a rapist subject to the criminal law irrespective of his relationship with his victim. The charge of rape had therefore properly been left to the jury. The appeal would accordingly be dismissed.\"\r\n\r\n      The Court of Appeal's decision was unanimously upheld by the House of Lords on 23 October 1991.  It considered that Sir Matthew Hale's common law proposition could not preclude the application of section 1 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 concerning the offence of rape.\r\n\r\n      The House of Lords' judgment was summarised by a Times Law Report as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"For over 150 years after the publication of Hale's work there appeared to have been no reported case in which judicial consideration was given to this proposition.  It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded as an accurate statement of the common law of England.\r\n\r\n      The common law was however capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments.  Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in those respects at the time it was enunciated.  Since then the status of women and particularly of married women had changed out of all recognition.\r\n\r\n      Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies one of the most important changes was that marriage was in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband.\r\n\r\n      Hale's proposition involved that by marriage a wife gave her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happened to be feeling at the time.  In modern times any reasonable person had to regard that conception as quite unacceptable.\r\n\r\n      The position was that part of Hale's proposition had been departed from in a series of decided cases.  On the ground of principle there was no good reason why the whole proposition of 'marital exemption' to rape should not be held inapplicable in modern times.\r\n\r\n      The only question was whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presented an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course.  The argument was that 'unlawful' in that subsection meant outside the bond of marriage.\r\n\r\n      That was not the most natural meaning of the word which normally described something which was contrary to some law or enactment or was done without lawful justification or excuse.  Certainly in modern times sexual intercourse outside marriage would not ordinarily be described as unlawful.\r\n\r\n      If the subsection proceeded on the basis that a woman on marriage gave a general consent to sexual intercourse there could be no question of intercourse with her by her husband being without consent.  There would thus be no point in enacting that only intercourse without consent outside marriage was to constitute rape.\r\n\r\n      There was another important context to section 1 (1), namely the existence of the exceptions to the marital exemption established by cases decided before the Act was passed.\r\n\r\n      Sexual intercourse in any of the cases covered by the exceptions still took place within the bond of marriage.  So if 'unlawful' in the subsection meant 'outside the bond of marriage' it followed that sexual intercourse in a case which fell within the exceptions was not covered by the definition of rape not- withstanding that it was not consented to by the wife.\r\n\r\n      That involved that the exceptions had been impliedly abolished. If the intention of Parliament was to abolish the exceptions it would have been expected to do so expressly and it was in fact inconceivable Parliament should have had such an intention.\r\n\r\n      In order that the exceptions might be preserved it would be necessary to construe 'unlawfully' so as to give it a meaning unique to that particular subsection and if the mind of the draughtsman has been directed to the existence of the exceptions he would surely have dealt with them specifically and not in such an oblique fashion.\r\n\r\n      The fact was it was clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent and that the use of the word in the subsection added nothing.  There were no rational grounds for putting the suggested gloss on the word and it should be treated as mere surplusage in the enactment.\r\n\r\n      Section 1 (1) of 1976 Act presented no obstacle to the House declaring that in modern times the supposed marital exemption in rape formed no part of the law of England.\"\r\n\r\nB.    Relevant Domestic Law and Practice\r\n\r\nCommon law\r\n\r\n      Until the applicant's case the English courts, on the few occasions that they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly, had always recognised at least some form of immunity as attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage.  The eighteenth century proposition of Sir Matthew Hale quoted above has been upheld until recently, for example in the case of R. Kowalski (1987, 86, Cr. App. R 339), which concerned the question of whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault.  Ian Kennedy J. giving the judgment of the court stated, obiter dicta,\r\n\r\n      \"It is clear, well-settled and ancient law that a man cannot, as actor, be guilty of rape upon his wife\" and he went on to say that that principle was \"dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi, by a separation order or, in certain circumstances, by a separation agreement\".\r\n\r\n      In another example, Lord Justice O'Connor in the R. v. Roberts case (1986 CLR 188) stated:\r\n\r\n      \"The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she cannot unilaterally withdraw it.\"\r\n\r\nSexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976\r\n\r\n      Section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides, in so far as it is material, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"For the purposes of section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which relates to rape) a man commits rape if\r\n\r\n      -    (a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it...\"\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that he is a victim of a violation of\r\nArticle 7 of the Convention, as well as Article 6.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 31 March 1992 and registered on 19 June 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 12 October 1992 the Commission decided to communicate the application to the Government and to ask for written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 29 January 1993 after one extension in the time-limit fixed for that purpose, and the applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 24 March 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 8 April 1993, the Commission granted the applicant legal aid.  On 28 June 1993, the Commission decided to hold an oral hearing, consecutive to a hearing in the case of W. v. the United Kingdom (No.\r\n20166/92).\r\n\r\n      At the hearing, which was held on 14 January 1994, the parties were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government\r\n\r\nMr. Huw Llewellyn                Agent\r\nMr. Alan Moses Q.C.              Counsel\r\nMiss Beverley Waplington         Legal Adviser, Home Office\r\nMr. Peter Dawson                 Administrator, Home Office\r\n\r\nFor the applicant\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Snow                   Legal officer\r\nMr. R. Guthrie                   Assistant\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains that he has been convicted in respect of conduct which at the relevant time did not constitute a criminal offence. He invokes Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention, which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.  Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.\r\n\r\n      2.   This Article (Art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.\"\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the applicant's conviction for the attempted rape of his wife was in conformity with Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention. By the relevant time, Hale's proposition that a wife's consent to sexual intercourse was irrevocable was no longer good law. English law did not therefore recognise any absolute immunity conferred on a husband who had sexual intercourse with a wife without her consent. There was case-law indicating that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife where a court had issued a decree nisi of divorce or a non-molestation order; where the husband had given an undertaking in lieu of an injunction not to molest his wife; where there was an agreement express or implied between the parties which made it clear that the implied consent of the wife was revoked; and where there had been a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated.\r\n\r\n      The Government contend that in the present case the facts indicated that the applicant's wife had revoked her consent by mutual agreement with the applicant. Even if the decisions of the courts were based rather on the fact that a wife was able unilaterally to withdraw her consent, this was a reasonable interpretation of the existing law in the light of changing social circumstances and clarified the existing elements of the offence.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that his conviction for the attempted rape of his wife concerned conduct which did not at the relevant time constitute a criminal offence under United Kingdom law. The general rule that a husband could not commit the offence of rape against his wife was universally accepted until 1990. While exceptions to this principle had developed, these were strictly limited to circumstances where, for example, there had been a court order or formal separation agreement.  The facts of this case do not disclose any mutual agreement between the applicant and his wife. There was no authority for the proposition that a wife could unilaterally withdraw her consent.\r\nFurthermore, in the applicant's case, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords acknowledged that they were changing the law, not merely clarifying it. The courts went beyond reasonable interpretation of the existing law and extended the definition of the offence in such a way as to include facts which hitherto had not constituted a criminal offence.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the parties. It considers that the applicant's complaint raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits. It follows that this part of the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant also complains that he did not receive a fair hearing in respect of the determination of his conjugal rights. He relies on Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. He claims that he was at no time afforded a proper determination of his civil rights and obligations with particular reference to the conjugal rights of both parties to a marriage and, moreover, that he was denied a fair trial of the charge against him by reason of the failure of the courts to observe, and give proper effect to, the statutory definition of rape (as `unlawful sexual intercourse') in section 1 (1) of the Sexual\r\nOffences (Amendment) Act 1976.\"\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were not solicited on this point.\r\n\r\n      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention provides in its first sentence as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law...\"\r\n\r\na.    As regards the applicant's complaints concerning conjugal rights, the Commission finds no indication that on the facts of the present case the applicant enjoyed any \"civil right\" with respect to the enjoyment of conjugal rights in the absence of the consent of his wife.\r\nThis aspect of the case must therefore be rejected as being incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention, pursuant to Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\nb.    As regards the applicant's complaints concerning the decisions of the courts in the criminal proceedings, the Commission recalls that, in accordance with Article 19 (Art. 19) of the Convention, its only task is to ensure the observance of the obligations undertaken by the\r\nParties in the Convention.  In particular, it is not competent to deal with an application alleging that errors of law or fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention.  The Commission refers, on this point, to its constant case-law (see eg. No. 458/59, X v. Belgium, Dec.\r\n29.3.60, Yearbook 3 pp.222, 236; No. 5258/71, X v. Sweden, Dec. 8.2.73,\r\nCollection 43 pp.71, 77; No. 7987/77, X v. Austria, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R.\r\n18 pp. 31, 45).\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that the applicant complains that the courts erred in their construction of the 1976 Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act. It is not for the Commission to re-assess these factual elements of the case before the domestic courts. Insofar as it is alleged that as a result the applicant was wrongly convicted of an offence which did not exist at the relevant time it raises no separate issue under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the case is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission by a majority\r\n\r\n      DECLARES ADMISSIBLE the complaint under Article 7 of the\r\n      Convention, without prejudging the merits;\r\n\r\n      DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission      President of the Commission\r\n\r\n      (H.C. KRÜGER)                    (C.A. NØRGAARD)\r\n\r\n",

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 22107/93)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n25 February 1997 \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the case of Findlay v. the United Kingdom ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tJ. DE MEYER,\r\n\tMrs \tE. PALM,\r\n\tMr \tA.N. LOIZOU,\r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND,\r\n\tMr \tD. GOTCHEV,\r\n\tMr \tP. JAMBREK,\r\n\tMr \tK. JUNGWIERT,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 September 1996 and 21 January 1997,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 8 December 1995, within the three month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 22107/93) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr Alexander Findlay, a British citizen, on 28 May 1993.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1).\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 8 February 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr J. De Meyer, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr D.Gotchev, Mr P. Jambrek and Mr K. Jungwiert (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 28 June 1996 and the Government’s memorial on 4 July 1996.\r\nOn 29 August 1996 the President decided to admit to the Court file an additional memorial submitted by the applicant which had been received by the Registrar on 7 August 1996 (Rule 37 para. 1).\r\n5.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 September 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. There appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government \r\nMs S. DICKSON, Foreign and Commonwealth Office,\tAgent,\r\nMr P. HAVERS QC,\r\nMr J. EADIE, Barrister-at-Law,\tCounsel,\r\nMr G. ROGERS, Ministry of Defence,\r\nMs J. MURNANE, Ministry of Defence,\r\nMr D. WOODHEAD, Ministry of Defence,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission \r\nMr N. BRATZA,\tDelegate,\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\nMr J. MACKENZIE, Solicitor,\tCounsel,\r\nMr G. BLADES, Solicitor,\r\nMr D. SULLIVAN, Solicitor,\tAdvisers.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Mackenzie and Mr Havers.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n6.   The applicant, Alexander Findlay, is a British citizen who was born in 1961 in Kilmarnock, Scotland, and now lives in Windsor, England.\r\n7.   In 1980 he joined the British army and became a member of the Scots Guards. His service was due to terminate in October or November 1992 when he would have received a resettlement grant and, at the age of sixty, an army pension.\r\n8.   In 1982 Mr Findlay took part in the Falklands campaign. During the battle of Mount Tumbledown he witnessed the death and mutilation of several of his friends and was himself injured in the wrist by a mortar-shell blast. According to the medical evidence prepared for his court martial (see paragraphs 11-13 below), as a result of these experiences he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"), which manifested itself by flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of anxiety, insomnia and outbursts of anger. This disorder was not diagnosed until after the events of 29 July 1990 (see paragraph 10 below).\r\n9.   In 1987 he sustained an injury during training for service in Northern Ireland when a rope which he was climbing broke and he fell to the ground, severely damaging his back. This injury was extremely painful and affected his ability to perform his duties, which, again according to the medical evidence, led him to suffer from feelings of stress, guilt and depression.\r\n10.   In 1990 the applicant, who had become a lance-sergeant, was sent with his regiment to Northern Ireland. On 29 July 1990, after a heavy drinking session, he held members of his own unit at pistol point and threatened to kill himself and some of his colleagues. He fired two shots, which were not aimed at anyone and hit a television set, and subsequently surrendered the pistol. He was then arrested.\r\n1. The medical evidence\r\n11.   On 31 July 1990 an ex-naval psychiatrist, Dr McKinnon, examined Mr Findlay and found that he was responsible for his actions at the time of the incident. However, a combination of stresses (including his back injury and posting to Northern Ireland) together with his heavy drinking on the day, had led to an \"almost inevitable\" event. Dr McKinnon recommended \"awarding the minimum appropriate punishment\".\r\nFollowing this report, the decision was taken to charge Mr Findlay with a number of offences arising out of the incident on 29 July (see paragraph 14 below).\r\n12.   In order to establish that he was fit to stand trial, at the request of the army he was examined on two occasions by Dr Blunden, a civilian consultant psychiatrist who had been employed by the Ministry of Defence since 1980.\r\nIn her report of January 1991, Dr Blunden confirmed that Mr Findlay was fit to plead and knew what he was doing at the time of the incident. However, his chronic back problem (which caused him to be frustrated and depressed at not being fit for duty in his Northern Ireland posting) together with \"his previous combat stresses and a very high level of alcohol ... combined to produce this dangerous behaviour\".\r\nIn her second report, of March 1991, she explained that the applicant had reacted to the stress caused by his back problems in the way he did on 29 July 1990 because of his experiences in the Falklands war. Whilst she did not clearly state that he suffered from PTSD, she confirmed that similar patterns of behaviour frequently occurred at a late stage in those who experienced this disorder. She confirmed that the consumption of alcohol on the relevant day was a result of his condition and not a cause of it.\r\n13.   Mr Findlay was also examined by Dr Reid, at the request of his (Mr Findlay’s) solicitor. Dr Reid diagnosed him as suffering from PTSD as a result of his service in the Falklands.\r\n2. The composition of the court martial\r\n14.   The position of \"convening officer\" (see paragraphs 36-41 below) for the applicant’s court martial was assumed by the General Officer Commanding London District, Major General Corbett. He remanded Mr Findlay for trial on eight charges arising out of the incident of 29 July 1990 and decided that he should be tried by general court martial.\r\n15.   By an order dated 31 October 1991, the convening officer convened the general court martial and appointed the military personnel who were to act as prosecuting officer, assistant prosecuting officer and assistant defending officer (to represent Mr Findlay in addition to his solicitor) and the members of the court martial (see paragraph 37 below).\r\n16.   The court martial consisted of a president and four other members:\r\n(1) the president, Colonel Godbold, was a member of London District staff (under the command of the convening officer: see paragraph 14 above). He was appointed by name by the latter and was not a permanent president;\r\n(2) Lieutenant-Colonel Swallow was a permanent president of courts martial, sitting in the capacity of an ordinary member. He had his office in the London District Headquarters. He was appointed by name by the convening officer;\r\n(3) Captain Tubbs was from the Coldstream Guards, a unit stationed in London District. His reporting chain was to his officer commanding, his commanding officer and the Brigade Commander, after which his report could, in exceptional circumstances, go to the convening officer; he was a member of a footguard unit and the convening officer, as General Officer Commanding, was responsible for all footguard units. He was appointed to the court martial by his commanding officer;\r\n(4) Major Bolitho was from the Grenadier Guards, also a footguard unit stationed in London District. The convening officer was his second superior reporting officer. He was appointed to the court martial by his commanding officer;\r\n(5) Captain O’Connor was from the Postal and Courier Department, Royal Engineers (Women’s Royal Army Corps), which is under the direct command of the Ministry of Defence and is administered by the London District. She was appointed by her commanding officer.\r\nIn summary, all of the members of the court martial were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and served in units stationed within London District. None of them had legal training.\r\n17.   The assistant prosecuting and defending officers were both officers from the Second Scots Guards stationed in the London District and had the same reporting chain as Captain Tubbs (see paragraph 16 (3) above).\r\n18.   The judge advocate for the general court martial was appointed by the Judge Advocate General (see paragraphs 42-45 below). He was a barrister and assistant judge advocate with the Judge Advocate General’s Office.\r\n3. The court martial hearing\r\n19.   On 11 November 1991, Mr Findlay appeared before the general court martial, at Regent’s Park Barracks in London. He was represented by a solicitor.\r\nHe pleaded guilty to three charges of common assault (a civilian offence), two charges of conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline (a military offence) and two charges of threatening to kill (a civilian offence).\r\n20.   On 2 November 1991, his solicitor had made a written request to the prosecuting authorities to ensure the appearance of Dr Blunden at the court martial and on 5 November 1991 the prosecuting officer had issued a witness summons requiring her attendance. However, the defence was informed on the morning of the hearing that Dr Blunden would not be attending. Mr Findlay claims that her absence persuaded him to plead guilty to the above charges. However, his solicitor did not request an adjournment or object to the hearing proceeding.\r\n21.   The defence put before the court martial the medical reports referred to above (paragraphs 11-13) and called Dr Reid to give evidence. The latter confirmed his view that the applicant suffered from PTSD, that this had been the principal cause of his behaviour, that he had not been responsible for his actions and that he was in need of counselling. During cross examination, Dr Reid stated that this was the first time he had dealt with battle-related PTSD.\r\nThe prosecution did not call any medical evidence in rebuttal or adopt any of the evidence prepared by the army-instructed psychiatrists, Drs McKinnon and Blunden (see paragraphs 11-13 above).\r\n22.   In the course of his speech in mitigation, Mr Findlay’s solicitor urged the court martial that, in view of the fact that his client had been suffering from PTSD at the time of the incident and was extremely unlikely to reoffend, he should be allowed to complete the few remaining months of his service and leave the army with his pension intact and a minimal endorsement on his record.\r\n23.   Having heard the evidence and speeches, the court martial retired to consider their decision on sentence, accompanied by the judge advocate. On their return they sentenced the applicant to two years’ imprisonment, reduction to the rank of guardsman and dismissal from the army (which caused him to suffer a reduction in his pension entitlement). No reasons were given for the sentence (see paragraph 46 below).\r\n4. The confirmation of sentence and review process\r\n24.   Under the Army Act 1955, the decision of the court martial had no effect until it was confirmed by the \"confirming officer\" (see paragraph 48 below). In Mr Findlay’s case, as was usual practice, the confirming officer was the same person as the convening officer. Mr Findlay petitioned him for a reduction in sentence.\r\nHaving received advice from the Judge Advocate General’s Office, the confirming officer informed the applicant on 16 December 1991 that the sentence had been upheld.\r\n25.   The applicant, who had been under close arrest since the morning before the court martial hearing, was removed on 18 November 1991 to a military prison and thereafter to a civilian prison on 21 December 1991.\r\n26.   He appealed by way of petition to the first of the \"reviewing authorities\" (see paragraph 49 below), the Deputy Director General of Personal Services, as delegate of the Army Board, a non-legally qualified officer who obtained advice from the Judge Advocate General’s Office. By a letter dated 22 January 1992, Mr Findlay was informed that this petition had been rejected.\r\n27.   He then petitioned the second of the reviewing authorities, a member of the Defence Council who also was not legally qualified and who also received advice from the Judge Advocate General’s Office. This petition was rejected on 10 March 1992.\r\n28.   The advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office at each of these three stages of review was not disclosed to the applicant, nor was he given reasons for the decisions confirming his sentence and rejecting his petitions.\r\n29.   On 10 March 1992, the applicant applied to the Divisional Court for leave to challenge by judicial review the validity of the findings of the court martial. He claimed that the sentence imposed was excessive, the proceedings were contrary to the rules of natural justice and that the judge advocate had been hostile to him on two occasions during the hearing.\r\nOn 14 December 1992 the Divisional Court refused leave on the basis that the court martial had been conducted fully in accordance with the Army Act 1955 and there was no evidence of improper conduct or hostility on the part of the judge advocate (R. v. General Court Martial (Regent’s Park Barracks), ex parte Alexander Findlay, CO/1092/92, unreported).\r\n5. Civil proceedings\r\n30.   Mr Findlay commenced a civil claim in negligence against the military authorities, claiming damages in respect of his back injury and PTSD. In a report dated 16 January 1994 prepared for these purposes, Dr Blunden confirmed her previous opinion (see paragraph 12 above) and clearly diagnosed PTSD.\r\n31.   In March 1994 the civil action was settled by the Secretary of State for Defence, who paid the applicant £100,000 and legal costs, without any admission of liability. The settlement did not differentiate between the claims in respect of PTSD and the back injury.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\n1. The law in force at the time of Mr Findlay’s court martial\r\n(a) General\r\n32.   The law and procedures which applied to the applicant’s court martial were contained in the Army Act 1955 (\"the 1955 Act\"), the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (\"the 1972 Rules\") and the Queen’s Regulations (1975). Since the Commission’s consideration of the case, certain provisions in the 1955 Act have been amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (\"the 1996 Act\"), which comes into force on 1 April 1997 (see paragraphs 52-57 below).\r\n33.   Many civilian offences are also offences under the 1955 Act (section 70 (1)). Although the final decision on jurisdiction lies with the civilian authorities, army personnel who are accused of such offences are usually tried by the military authorities unless, for example, civilians are involved in some way.\r\nDepending on their gravity, charges against army law can be tried by district, field or general court martial. A court martial is not a standing court: it comes into existence in order to try a single offence or group of offences.\r\n34.   At the time of the events in question, a general court martial consisted of a president (normally a brigadier or colonel in the army), appointed by name by the convening officer (see paragraphs 36-41 below), and at least four other army officers, either appointed by name by the convening officer or, at the latter’s request, by their commanding officer.\r\n35.   Each member of the court martial had to swear the following oath:\r\n\"I swear by almighty God that I will well and truly try the accused before the court according to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice according to the Army Act 1955, without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any time whatsoever disclose or discover the vote or opinion of the president or any member of this court martial, unless thereunto required in the due course of law.\"\r\n(b) The convening officer\r\n36.   Before the coming into force of the 1996 Act, a convening officer (who had to be a field officer or of corresponding or superior rank, in command of a body of the regular forces or of the command within which the person to be tried was serving) assumed responsibility for every case to be tried by court martial. He or she would decide upon the nature and detail of the charges to be brought and the type of court martial required, and was responsible for convening the court martial.\r\n37.   The convening officer would draw up a convening order, which would specify, inter alia, the date, place and time of the trial, the name of the president and the details of the other members, all of whom he could appoint (see paragraph 15 above). He ensured that a judge advocate (see paragraph 43 below) was appointed by the Judge Advocate General’s Office and, failing such appointment, could appoint one. He also appointed, or directed a commanding officer to appoint, the prosecuting officer.\r\n38.   Prior to the hearing, the convening officer was responsible for sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and to the judge advocate, and could indicate the passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for the prosecution. When charges were withdrawn, the convening officer’s consent was normally obtained, although it was not necessary in all cases, and a plea to a lesser charge could not be accepted from the accused without it.\r\n39.   He had also to ensure that the accused had a proper opportunity to prepare his defence, legal representation if required and the opportunity to contact the defence witnesses, and was responsible for ordering the attendance at the hearing of all witnesses \"reasonably requested\" by the defence.\r\n40.   The convening officer could dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial, when required in the interests of the administration of justice (section 95 of the 1955 Act). In addition, he could comment on the \"proceedings of a court martial which require confirmation\". Those remarks would not form part of the record of the proceedings and would normally be communicated in a separate minute to the members of the court, although in an exceptional case \"where a more public instruction [was] required in the interests of discipline\", they could be made known in the orders of the command (Queen’s Regulations, paragraph 6.129).\r\n41.   The convening officer usually acted as confirming officer also (see paragraph 48 below).\r\n(c) The Judge Advocate General and judge advocates\r\n42.   The current Judge Advocate General was appointed by the Queen in February 1991 for five years. He is answerable to the Queen and is removable from office by her for inability or misbehaviour.\r\nAt the time of the events in question, the Judge Advocate General had the role of adviser to the Secretary of State for Defence on all matters touching and concerning the office of Judge Advocate General, including advice on military law and the procedures and conduct of the court-martial system. He was also responsible for advising the confirming and reviewing authorities following a court martial (see paragraph 49 below).\r\n43.   Judge advocates are appointed to the Judge Advocate General’s Office by the Lord Chancellor. They must have at least seven and five years experience respectively as an advocate or barrister.\r\n44.   At the time of the events in question, a judge advocate was appointed to each court martial, either by the Judge Advocate General’s Office or by the convening officer. He or she was responsible for advising the court martial on all questions of law and procedure arising during the hearing and the court had to accept this advice unless there were weighty reasons for not doing so. In addition, in conjunction with the president, he was under a duty to ensure that the accused did not suffer any disadvantage during the hearing. For example, if the latter pleaded guilty, the judge advocate had to ensure that he or she fully understood the implications of the plea and admitted all the elements of the charge. At the close of the hearing, the judge advocate would sum up the relevant law and evidence.\r\n45.   Prior to the coming into force of the 1996 Act, the judge advocate did not take part in the court martial’s deliberations on conviction or acquittal, although he could advise it in private on general principles in relation to sentencing. He was not a member of the court martial and had no vote in the decision on conviction or sentence.\r\n(d) Procedure on a guilty plea\r\n46.   At the time of the events in question, on a plea of guilty, the prosecuting officer outlined the facts and put in evidence any circumstance which might have made the accused more susceptible to the commission of the offence. The defence made a plea in mitigation and could call witnesses (rules 71 (3) (a) and 71 (5) (a) of the 1972 Rules). The members of the court martial then retired with the judge advocate to consider the sentence, which was pronounced in open court. There was no provision for the giving of reasons by the court martial for its decision.\r\n47.   Certain types of sentence were not available to courts martial at the time of the applicant’s trial, even in respect of civilian offences. For example, a court martial could not suspend a prison sentence, issue a probation order or sentence to community service.\r\n(e) Confirmation and post-hearing reviews\r\n48.   Until the amendments introduced by the 1996 Act, a court martial’s findings were not effective until confirmed by a \"confirming officer\". Prior to confirmation, the confirming officer used to seek the advice of the Judge Advocate General’s Office, where a judge advocate different to the one who acted at the hearing would be appointed. The confirming officer could withhold confirmation or substitute, postpone or remit in whole or in part any sentence.\r\n49.   Once the sentence had been confirmed, the defendant could petition the \"reviewing authorities\". These were the Queen, the Defence Council (who could delegate to the Army Board), or any officer superior in command to the confirming officer (section 113 of the 1955 Act). The reviewing authorities could seek the advice of the Judge Advocate General’s Office. They had the power to quash a finding and to exercise the same powers as the confirming officer in relation to substituting, remitting or commuting the sentence.\r\n50.   A petitioner was not informed of the identity of the confirming officer or of the reviewing authorities. No statutory or formalised procedures were laid down for the conduct of the post-hearing reviews and no reasons were given for decisions delivered subsequent to them. Neither the fact that advice had been received from the Judge Advocate General’s Office nor the nature of that advice was disclosed.\r\n51.   A courts martial appeal court (made up of civilian judges) could hear appeals against conviction from a court martial, but there was no provision for such an appeal against sentence when the accused pleaded guilty.\r\n2. The Armed Forces Act 1996\r\n52.   Under the 1996 Act, the role of the convening officer will cease to exist and his functions will be split among three different bodies: the \"higher authorities\", the prosecuting authority and court administration officers (see 1996 Act, Schedule I).\r\n53.   The higher authority, who will be a senior officer, will decide whether any case referred to him by the accused’s commanding officer should be dealt with summarily, referred to the new prosecuting authority, or dropped. Once the higher authority has taken this decision, he or she will have no further involvement in the case.\r\n54.   The prosecuting authority will be the Services’ legal branches. Following the higher authority’s decision to refer a case to them, the prosecuting authority will have absolute discretion, applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether or not to prosecute, what type of court martial would be appropriate and precisely what charges should be brought. They will then conduct the prosecution (1996 Act, Schedule I, Part II).\r\n55.   Court administration officers will be appointed in each Service and will be independent of both the higher and the prosecuting authorities. They will be responsible for making the arrangements for courts martial, including arranging venue and timing, ensuring that a judge advocate and any court officials required will be available, securing the attendance of witnesses and selection of members. Officers under the command of the higher authority will not be selected as members of the court martial (1996 Act, Schedule I, Part III, section 19).\r\n56.   Each court martial will in future include a judge advocate as a member. His advice on points of law will become rulings binding on the court and he will have a vote on sentence (but not on conviction). The casting vote, if needed, will rest with the president of the court martial, who will also give reasons for the sentence in open court. The Judge Advocate General will no longer provide general legal advice to the Secretary of State for Defence (1996 Act, Schedule I, Part III, sections 19, 25 and 27).\r\n57.   Findings by a court martial will no longer be subject to confirmation or revision by a confirming officer (whose role is to be abolished). A reviewing authority will be established in each Service to conduct a single review of each case. Reasons will be given for the decision of the reviewing authority. As part of this process, post-trial advice received by the reviewing authority from a judge advocate (who will be different from the one who officiated at the court-martial) will be disclosed to the accused. A right of appeal against sentence to the (civilian) courts martial appeal court will be added to the existing right of appeal against conviction (1996 Act, section 17 and Schedule V).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n58.   In his application to the Commission (no. 22107/93) of 28 May 1993, Mr Findlay made a number of complaints under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1), inter alia that he had been denied a fair hearing before the court martial and that it was not an independent and impartial tribunal.\r\n59.   The Commission declared the application admissible on 23 February 1995. In its report of 5 September 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1), in that the applicant was not given a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, and that it was unnecessary to examine the further specific complaints as to the fairness of the court-martial proceedings and the subsequent reviews or the reasonableness of the decisions taken against him and the available sentencing options. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n60.   At the hearing, the Government said that it did not contest the Commission’s conclusions but asked the Court to take note of the changes to the court-martial system to be effected by the Armed Forces Act 1996 which, they submitted, more than satisfactorily met the Commission’s concerns.\r\nOn the same occasion, the applicant asked the Court to find a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   SCOPE OF THE CASE\r\nA. The complaints concerning Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1)\r\n61.   In his written and oral pleadings before the Court, Mr Findlay complained that the court martial was not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\", that it did not give him a \"public hearing\" and that it was not a tribunal \"established by law\".\r\n62.   The Government and the Commission’s Delegate both observed at the hearing that since the latter two complaints had not been expressly raised before the Commission, the Court should decline to entertain them.\r\n63.   The Court recalls that the scope of its jurisdiction is determined by the Commission’s decision on admissibility and that it has no power to entertain new and separate complaints which were not raised before the Commission (see, inter alia, the Singh v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 293, para. 44).\r\nHowever, while Mr Findlay in his application to the Commission may not expressly have invoked his rights under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) to a \"public hearing\" and a \"tribunal established by law\", he does appear to have raised in substance most of the matters which form the basis of his complaints in relation to these two provisions. Thus, in the Commission’s decision on admissibility, he is reported as referring in particular to the facts that the members of the court martial were appointed ad hoc, that the judge advocate’s advice on sentencing was not disclosed, that no reasons were given for the decisions taken by the court-martial board and the confirming and reviewing officers, and that the post-hearing reviews were essentially administrative in nature and conducted in private (see the Commission’s decision on admissibility, application no. 22107/93, pp. 32 35).\r\nIt follows that these are not new and separate complaints, and that the Court has jurisdiction to consider these matters (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, p. 46, para. 80).\r\nB. The complaint concerning Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement\r\n64.   In his additional memorial (see paragraph 4 above) the applicant asserted that, in correspondence with the Solicitors’ Complaints Bureau (a professional disciplinary body) concerning a matter of no relevance to the present case, the Judge Advocate General had complained that, during the course of Mr Findlay’s application to the Commission, his solicitor had made allegations concerning a lack of impartiality in the advice given by the Judge Advocate General’s Office. The Judge Advocate General, Judge Rant, had commented: \"These are extremely serious allegations ...\".\r\nIn a later letter, Judge Rant wrote:\r\n\"I wish to make it clear that, at this stage and without prejudice to any action which might have to be taken in the future, I am making no formal complaint about the passage [from the applicant’s submission to the Commission] quoted in that letter. The reason for this is that the case of Findlay is to be argued before the European Court of Human Rights in September 1996 and therefore it is only proper for me to defer action until the end of those proceedings.\"\r\nThe applicant alleged that his solicitor felt constrained in presenting his arguments to the Court in the knowledge that they might subsequently form the basis of disciplinary proceedings and he invoked his rights under Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) and Article 2 of the European Agreement relating to Persons Participating in Proceedings before the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.\r\n65.   Since this issue was not pursued by the applicant at the hearing or referred to by the Government or the Delegate of the Commission at any time, the Court does not find it appropriate to examine it.\r\nC. The new legislation\r\n66.   In their written and oral pleadings, the Government asked the Court to take note in its judgment of the changes to be effected in the court-martial system by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (see paragraphs 52-57 above).\r\n67.   The Court recalls that this new statute does not come into force until April 1997, and thus did not apply at the time of Mr Findlay’s court martial. It is not the Court’s task to rule on legislation in abstracto and it cannot therefore express a view as to the compatibility of the provisions of the new legislation with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Silver and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 March 1983, Series A no. 61, p. 31, para. 79). Nonetheless, it notes with satisfaction that the United Kingdom authorities have made changes to the court-martial system with a view to ensuring the observance of their Convention commitments.\r\nII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 6-1)\r\n68.   The applicant claimed that his trial by court martial failed to meet the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1), which provides (so far as is relevant):\r\n\"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ...\"\r\nThe Commission found that there had been a violation, in that the applicant was not given a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, and the Government did not contest this conclusion.\r\nA. Applicability\r\n69.   In the view of the Court, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is clearly applicable to the court-martial proceedings, since they involved the determination of Mr Findlay’s sentence following his plea of guilty to criminal charges; indeed, this point was not disputed before it (see the Engel and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 18 June 1976, Series A no. 22, pp. 33-36, paras. 80-85, and the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 34-35, paras. 76-77).\r\nB. Compliance\r\n70.   The applicant complained that the court martial was not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\" as required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6 1), because, inter alia, all the officers appointed to it were directly subordinate to the convening officer who also performed the role of prosecuting authority (see paragraphs 14-17 and 36-41 above). The lack of legal qualification or experience in the officers making the decisions either at the court martial or review stages made it impossible for them to act in an independent or impartial manner.\r\nIn addition, he asserted that he was not afforded a \"public hearing\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), in that the judge advocate’s advice to the court-martial board, the confirming officer and the reviewing authorities was confidential; no reasons were given for the decisions made at any of these stages in the proceedings; and the process of confirming and reviewing the verdict and sentence by the confirming officer and reviewing authorities was carried out administratively, in private, with no apparent rules of procedure (see paragraphs 42-46 and 48-51 above).\r\nFinally, he claimed that his court martial was not a tribunal \"established by law\", because the statutory framework according to which it proceeded was too vague and imprecise; for example, it was silent on the question of how the convening officer, confirming officer and reviewing authorities were to be appointed.\r\n71.   The Government had no observations to make upon the Commission’s conclusion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1) by reason of the width of the role of the convening officer and his command links with members of the tribunal. They asked the Court to take note of the changes to the court-martial system to be effected by the Armed Forces Act 1996 which, in their submission, more than satisfactorily met the Commission’s concerns.\r\n72.   The Commission found that although the convening officer played a central role in the prosecution of the case, all of the members of the court martial board were subordinate in rank to him and under his overall command. He also acted as confirming officer, and the court martial’s findings had no effect until confirmed by him. These circumstances gave serious cause to doubt the independence of the tribunal from the prosecuting authority. The judge advocate’s involvement was not sufficient to dispel this doubt, since he was not a member of the court martial, did not take part in its deliberations and gave his advice on sentencing in private. In addition, it noted that Mr Findlay’s court-martial board contained no judicial members, no legally qualified members and no civilians, that it was set up on an ad hoc basis and that the convening officer had the power to dissolve it either before or during the trial. The requirement to take an oath was not a sufficient guarantee of independence.\r\nAccordingly, it considered that the applicant’s fears about the independence of the court martial could be regarded as objectively justified, particularly in view of the nature and extent of the convening officer’s roles, the composition of the court martial and its ad hoc nature. This defect was not, moreover, remedied by any subsequent review by a judicial body affording all the guarantees required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), since the confirming officer was the same person as the convening officer, and the reviewing authorities were army officers, the second of whom was superior in rank to the first. The ineffectiveness of the post-hearing reviews was further underlined by the secrecy surrounding them and the lack of opportunity for Mr Findlay to participate in a meaningful way.\r\n73.   The Court recalls that in order to establish whether a tribunal can be considered as \"independent\", regard must be had, inter alia, to the manner of appointment of its members and their term of office, the existence of guarantees against outside pressures and the question whether the body presents an appearance of independence (see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 15, para. 37).\r\nAs to the question of \"impartiality\", there are two aspects to this requirement. First, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias. Secondly, it must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in this respect (see the Pullar v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 792, para. 30).\r\nThe concepts of independence and objective impartiality are closely linked and the Court will consider them together as they relate to the present case.\r\n74.   The Court observes that the convening officer, as was his responsibility under the rules applicable at the time, played a significant role before the hearing of Mr Findlay’s case. He decided which charges should be brought and which type of court martial was most appropriate. He convened the court martial and appointed its members and the prosecuting and defending officers (see paragraphs 14-15 and 36-37 above).\r\nUnder the rules then in force, he had the task of sending an abstract of the evidence to the prosecuting officer and the judge advocate and could indicate passages which might be inadmissible. He procured the attendance at trial of the witnesses for the prosecution and those \"reasonably requested\" by the defence. His agreement was necessary before the prosecuting officer could accept a plea to a lesser charge from an accused and was usually sought before charges were withdrawn (see paragraphs 38 and 39 above).\r\nFor these reasons the Court, like the Commission, considers that the convening officer was central to Mr Findlay’s prosecution and closely linked to the prosecuting authorities.\r\n75.   The question therefore arises whether the members of the court martial were sufficiently independent of the convening officer and whether the organisation of the trial offered adequate guarantees of impartiality.\r\nIn this respect also the Court shares the concerns of the Commission. It is noteworthy that all the members of the court martial, appointed by the convening officer, were subordinate in rank to him. Many of them, including the president, were directly or ultimately under his command (see paragraph 16 above). Furthermore, the convening officer had the power, albeit in prescribed circumstances, to dissolve the court martial either before or during the trial (see paragraph 40 above).\r\n76.   In order to maintain confidence in the independence and impartiality of the court, appearances may be of importance. Since all the members of the court martial which decided Mr Findlay’s case were subordinate in rank to the convening officer and fell within his chain of command, Mr Findlay’s doubts about the tribunal’s independence and impartiality could be objectively justified (see, mutatis mutandis, the Sramek v. Austria judgment of 22 October 1984, Series A no. 84, p. 20, para. 42).\r\n77.   In addition, the Court finds it significant that the convening officer also acted as \"confirming officer\". Thus, the decision of the court martial was not effective until ratified by him, and he had the power to vary the sentence imposed as he saw fit (see paragraph 48 above). This is contrary to the well-established principle that the power to give a binding decision which may not be altered by a non-judicial authority is inherent in the very notion of \"tribunal\" and can also be seen as a component of the \"independence\" required by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Van de Hurk v. the Netherlands judgment of 19 April 1994, Series A no. 288, p. 16, para. 45).\r\n78.   The Court further agrees with the Commission that these fundamental flaws in the court-martial system were not remedied by the presence of safeguards, such as the involvement of the judge advocate, who was not himself a member of the tribunal and whose advice to it was not made public (see paragraphs 45-46 above), or the oath taken by the members of the court-martial board (see paragraph 35 above).\r\n79.   Nor could the defects referred to above (in paragraphs 75 and 77) be corrected by any subsequent review proceedings. Since the applicant’s hearing was concerned with serious charges classified as \"criminal\" under both domestic and Convention law, he was entitled to a first-instance tribunal which fully met the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) (see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, pp. 16-18, paras. 31-32).\r\n80.   For all these reasons, and in particular the central role played by the convening officer in the organisation of the court martial, the Court considers that Mr Findlay’s misgivings about the independence and impartiality of the tribunal which dealt with his case were objectively justified.\r\nIn view of the above, it is not necessary for it to consider the applicant’s other complaints under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), namely that he was not afforded a \"public hearing\" by a tribunal \"established by law\".\r\nIn conclusion, there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1).\r\nIII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50)\r\n81.   The applicant claimed just satisfaction pursuant to Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50), which states:\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\r\nA. Pecuniary damage\r\n82.   The applicant claimed compensation for loss of income totalling 440,200 pounds sterling (GBP), on the basis that, had he not been convicted and sentenced as he was, he would have completed a twenty-two year engagement in the army, eventually attaining the rank of Colour Sergeant, with entitlement to a pension from the age of forty.\r\n83.   The Government submitted that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient satisfaction, or, in the alternative, that only a very modest amount should be awarded. First, there were no grounds for believing that the applicant would not have been convicted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment and dismissed from the army following his trial (at which he pleaded guilty), even if the court martial had been differently organised. Secondly, it was in any case unlikely that he would have enjoyed a long career in the army, in view of the post traumatic stress disorder and back injury from which he suffered (see paragraphs 8, 9 and 30 above); he had already received GBP 100,000 in settlement of his civil claim against the Ministry of Defence, a large part of which related to loss of earning capacity.\r\n84.   At the hearing, the Commission’s Delegate observed that no causal link had been established between the breach of the Convention complained of by the applicant and the alleged pecuniary damage, and submitted that it was not possible to speculate as to whether the proceedings would have led to a different outcome had they fulfilled the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\n85.   The Court agrees; it cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the court-martial proceedings might have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred (see, for example, the Schmautzer v. Austria judgment of 23 October 1995, Series A no. 328-A, p. 16, para. 44). It is therefore inappropriate to award Mr Findlay compensation for pecuniary damage.\r\nB. Non-pecuniary damage\r\n86.   The applicant claimed compensation of GBP 50,000 for the distress and suffering caused by the court-martial proceedings and for the eight months he spent in prison. He also asked that his conviction be quashed.\r\n87.   The Government pointed out that it was beyond the power of the Court to quash the applicant’s conviction.\r\n88.   The Court reiterates that it is impossible to speculate as to what might have occurred had there been no breach of the Convention. Furthermore, it has no jurisdiction to quash convictions pronounced by national courts (see the above-mentioned Schmautzer judgment, loc. cit.).\r\nIn conclusion, the Court considers that a finding of violation in itself affords the applicant sufficient reparation for the alleged non-pecuniary damage.\r\nC. Costs and expenses 89.\r\nThe applicant claimed GBP 23,956.25 legal costs and expenses, which included GBP 1,000 solicitor’s costs and GBP 250 counsel’s fees for the application before the Divisional Court.\r\n90.   The Government expressed the view that the costs of the application to the Divisional Court should be disallowed, and submitted that a total of GBP 22,500 would be a reasonable sum.\r\n91.   The Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, it was reasonable to make the application to the Divisional Court, in an attempt to seek redress for the violation of which Mr Findlay complains. It therefore decides to award in full the costs and expenses claimed, less the amounts received in legal aid from the Council of Europe which have not already been taken into account in the claim.\r\nD. Default interest\r\n92.   According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.   Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1);\r\n\r\n2.   Dismisses the claim for pecuniary damage;\r\n\r\n3.   Holds that the finding of a violation in itself constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage alleged by the applicant;\r\n\r\n4.   Holds\r\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant, within three months, in respect of costs and expenses, GBP 23,956.25 (twenty-three thousand, nine hundred and fifty-six pounds sterling and twenty-five pence) less 26,891 (twenty-six thousand, eight hundred and ninety-one) French francs, to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment;\r\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 8% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement.\r\nDone in English and in French and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 February 1997.\r\n\r\nRolv RYSSDAL\r\nPresident\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the concurring opinion of Mr De Meyer is annexed to this judgment.\r\nR. R.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\r\nTo this judgment, the result of which I fully approve, I would add a brief remark.\r\nOnce again reference is made in its reasoning to \"appearances\" (paragraphs 73 and 76).\r\nFirst of all, I would observe that the Court did not need to rely on \"appearances\", since there were enough convincing elements to enable it to conclude that the court-martial system, under which Lance-Sergeant Findlay was convicted and sentenced in the present case, was not acceptable.\r\nMoreover, I would like to stress that, as a matter of principle, we should never decide anything on the basis of \"appearances\", and that we should, in particular, not allow ourselves to be impressed by them in determining whether or not a court is independent and impartial. We have been wrong to do so in the past, and we should not do so in the future.\r\n",

Turkey ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMM\tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\t\tTHÓR VILHJÁLMSSON,\r\n\t\tF. GÖLCÜKLÜ,\r\n\t\tL.-E. PETTITI,\r\n\t\tJ. DE MEYER,\r\n\t\tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\t\tA.B. BAKA,\r\n\t\tJ. MAKARCZYK,\r\n\t\tU. LOHMUS,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 April, 24 October and 26 November 1996,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court on 4 December 1995 by the Government of Turkey (\"the Government\") and on 12 December 1995 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\"), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 21987/93) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 20 May 1993 by Mr Zeki Aksoy, a Turkish citizen.\r\nThe Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48); the Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Turkey recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 3, 5 para. 3, 6 para. 1 and 13 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 5-3, art. 6-1, art. 13).\r\n2.   On 16 April 1994 the applicant was shot and killed. On 20 April 1994 his representatives informed the Commission that his father wished to continue with the case.\r\n3.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant’s father (who shall, henceforward, also be referred to as \"the applicant\") stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him.\r\nOn 26 March 1996 the President granted leave, pursuant to Rule 30 para. 1, to Ms Françoise Hampson, a Reader in Law at the University of Essex, to act as the applicant’s representative.\r\n4.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr F. Gölcüklü, the elected judge of Turkish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 5 December 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L. E. Pettiti, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr F. Bigi, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr U. Lohmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Following the death of Mr Bigi, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, the first substitute, became a member of the Chamber.\r\n5.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 7 March 1996 and the Government’s memorial on 15 March 1996.\r\n6.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 April 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n- for the Government\r\n\t\tMr B. ÇAGLAR, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\tAgent,\r\n\t\tMs D. AKÇAY,\r\n\t\tMr T. ÖZKAROL,\r\n\t\tMr A. KURUDAL,\r\n\t\tMr F. ERDOGAN,\r\n\t\tMr O. SEVER,\r\n\t\tMs M. GÜLSEN,\tCounsel;\r\n- for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr H. DANELIUS,\tDelegate;\r\n- for the applicant\r\n\t\tMs F. HAMPSON, University of Essex,\r\n\t\tMr K. BOYLE, Barrister-at-Law,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr K. YILDIZ,\r\n\t\tMr T. FISHER,\r\n\t\tMs A. REIDY,\tAdvisers.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Danelius, Ms Hampson, Mr Çaglar and Ms Akçay.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\nA. The applicant\r\n7.   The applicant, Mr Zeki Aksoy, was a Turkish citizen who, at the time of the events in question, lived in Mardin, Kiziltepe, in South-East Turkey, where he was a metal worker. He was born in 1963 and was shot and killed on 16 April 1994. Since then, his father has indicated that he wishes to pursue the case (see paragraph 3 above).\r\nB. The situation in the South-East of Turkey\r\n8.   Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in the South-East of Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has so far, according to the Government, claimed the lives of 4,036 civilians and 3,884 members of the security forces.\r\n9.   At the time of the Court’s consideration of the case, ten of the eleven provinces of south-eastern Turkey had since 1987 been subjected to emergency rule.\r\nC. The detention of the applicant\r\n10.   The facts in the case are in dispute.\r\n11.   According to the applicant, he was taken into custody on 24 November 1992, between 11 p.m. and midnight. Approximately twenty policemen had come to his home, accompanied by a detainee called Metin who, allegedly, had identified the applicant as a member of the PKK, although Mr Aksoy told the police that he did not know Metin.\r\n12.   The Government submitted that the applicant was arrested and taken into custody on 26 November 1992 at around 8.30 a.m., together with thirteen others, on suspicion of aiding and abetting PKK terrorists, being a member of the Kiziltepe branch of the PKK and distributing PKK tracts.\r\n13.   The applicant stated that he was taken to Kiziltepe Security Headquarters. After one night, he was transferred to Mardin Antiterrorist Headquarters.\r\nHe was allegedly detained, with two others, in a cell measuring approximately 1.5 x 3 metres, with one bed and a blanket, but no pillow. He was provided with two meals a day.\r\n14.   He was interrogated about whether he knew Metin (the man who had identified him). He claimed to have been told: \"If you don’t know him now, you will know him under torture.\"\r\nAccording to the applicant, on the second day of his detention he was stripped naked, his hands were tied behind his back and he was strung up by his arms in the form of torture known as \"Palestinian hanging\". While he was hanging, the police connected electrodes to his genitals and threw water over him while they electrocuted him. He was kept blindfolded during this torture, which continued for approximately thirty-five minutes.\r\nDuring the next two days, he was allegedly beaten repeatedly at intervals of two hours or half an hour, without being suspended. The torture continued for four days, the first two being very intensive.\r\n15.   He claimed that, as a result of the torture, he lost the movement of his arms and hands. His interrogators ordered him to make movements to restore the control of his hands. He asked to see a doctor, but was refused permission.\r\n16.   On 8 December 1992 the applicant was seen by a doctor in the medical service of the sub-prefecture. A medical report was prepared, stating in a single sentence that the applicant bore no traces of blows or violence. According to Mr Aksoy, the doctor asked how his arms had been injured and was told by a police officer that he had had an accident. The doctor then commented, mockingly, that everyone who came there seemed to have an accident.\r\n17.   The Government submitted that there were fundamental doubts as to whether the applicant had been ill-treated while in police custody.\r\n18.   On 10 December 1992, immediately before his release, Mr Aksoy was brought before the Mardin public prosecutor.\r\nAccording to the Government, he was able to sign a statement denying any involvement with the PKK and made no complaint about having been tortured.\r\nThe applicant, however, submitted that he was shown a statement for signature, but said that its contents were untrue. The prosecutor insisted he sign it but Mr Aksoy told him that he could not because he could not move his hands.\r\nD. Events on the applicant’s release\r\n19.   Mr Aksoy was released on 10 December 1992. He was admitted to Dicle University Medical Faculty Hospital on 15 December 1992, where he was diagnosed as suffering from bilateral radial paralysis (that is, paralysis of both arms caused by nerve damage in the upper arms). He told the doctor who treated him that he had been in custody and strung up with his arms tied behind his back.\r\nHe remained at the hospital until 31 December 1992 when, according to the Government, he left without having been properly discharged, taking his medical file with him.\r\n20.   On 21 December 1992, the public prosecutor decided that there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant, although eleven of the others detained with him were charged.\r\n21.   No criminal or civil proceedings have been brought in the Turkish courts in relation to the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant.\r\nE. The death of the applicant\r\n22.   Mr Aksoy was shot dead on 16 April 1994.\r\nAccording to his representatives, he had been threatened with death in order to make him withdraw his application to the Commission, the last threat being made by telephone on 14 April 1994, and his murder was a direct result of his persisting with the application.\r\nThe Government, however, submitted that his killing was a settling of scores between quarrelling PKK factions.\r\nA suspect, allegedly a member of the PKK, has been charged with the murder.\r\nF. The Commission’s findings of fact\r\n23.   Delegates of the Commission heard evidence from witnesses in the case in Diyarbakir between 13 and 14 March 1995 and in Ankara between 12 and 14 April 1995, in the presence of representatives from both sides who were able to cross-examine the witnesses. In addition, the Commission heard oral submissions on admissibility and the merits at hearings in Strasbourg on 18 October 1994 and 3 July 1995.\r\nAfter evaluating the oral and documentary evidence, the Commission came to the following conclusions with regard to the facts:\r\na) It was not possible to make a definite finding as to the date on which Mr Aksoy was arrested, although this clearly took place no later than 26 November 1992. He was released on 10 December 1992, therefore he was detained for at least fourteen days.\r\nb) On 15 December 1992 he was admitted to hospital and was diagnosed with bilateral radial paralysis. He left hospital on 31 December 1992 on his own initiative, without having been properly discharged.\r\nc) There was no evidence that he had suffered any disability prior to his arrest, nor any evidence of any untoward incident during the five days between his release from police custody and his admission to hospital.\r\nd) The Commission noted that the medical evidence indicated that the applicant’s injuries could have had various causes, but one of these could have been the trauma suffered by a person who had been strung up by his arms. Moreover, radial paralysis affecting both arms was apparently not a common condition, although it was consistent with the form of ill-treatment known as \"Palestinian hanging\".\r\ne) The delegates heard evidence from one of the policemen who had interrogated Mr Aksoy and from the public prosecutor who saw him prior to his release; both claimed that it was inconceivable that he could have been ill-treated in any way. The Commission found this evidence unconvincing, since it gave the impression that the two public officers were not prepared even to consider the possibility of ill-treatment occurring at the hands of the police.\r\nf) The Government offered no alternative explanation for Mr Aksoy’s injuries.\r\ng) There was insufficient evidence to enable any conclusions to be drawn with regard to the applicant’s other allegations of ill-treatment by electric shocks and beatings. However, it did seem clear that he had been detained in a small cell with two other people, all of whom had had to share a single bed and blanket, and that he had been kept blindfolded during interrogation.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\nA. Criminal-law provisions against torture\r\n24.   The Turkish Criminal Code makes it an offence for a government employee to subject someone to torture or ill-treatment (Article 243 in respect of torture, and Article 245 in respect of ill-treatment).\r\n25.   Article 8 of Decree no. 430 of 16 December 1990 provides as follows:\r\n\"No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the State of Emergency Regional Governor or a Provincial Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of an individual to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.\"\r\n26.   Prosecutors are under a duty to investigate allegations of serious offences which come to their attention, even if no complaint is made. However, in the state of emergency region, the investigation of criminal offences by members of the administration is taken up by local administrative councils, composed of civil servants. These councils are also empowered to decide whether or not to bring a prosecution, subject to an automatic judicial review before the Supreme Administrative Court in cases where they decide not to prosecute (Legislative Decree no. 285).\r\nB. Administrative law remedies\r\n27.   Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:\r\n\"All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...\r\nThe administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.\"\r\nBy virtue of this provision, the State is liable to indemnify any person who can prove that he has suffered damage in circumstances where the State has failed in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.\r\nC. Civil proceedings\r\n28.   Any illegal act which causes damage committed by a civil servant (except the regional or district prefects in the state of emergency region) may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts.\r\nD. The law relating to detention in police custody\r\n29.   Pursuant to Article 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a person arrested and detained shall be brought before a justice of the peace within twenty-four hours. This period may be extended to four days when the individual is detained in connection with a collective offence.\r\nThe permissible periods of detention without judicial control are longer in relation to proceedings before the State security courts. In such a case, it is possible to detain a suspect for a period of forty-eight hours in connection with an individual offence, and fifteen days in connection with a collective offence (section 30 of Law no. 3842 of 1 December 1992, re-enacting Article 11 of Decree having the force of law no. 285 of 10 July 1987).\r\nIn the region under emergency rule, however, a person arrested in connection with proceedings before the State security courts may be detained for four days in the case of individual offences and thirty days in the case of collective offences before being brought before a magistrate (ibid., re-enacting section 26 of Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983).\r\n30.   Article 19 of the Turkish Constitution gives to a detained person the right to have the lawfulness of his detention reviewed, on application to the court with jurisdiction over his case.\r\nE. The Turkish derogation from Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5)\r\n31.   In a letter dated 6 August 1990, the Permanent Representative of Turkey to the Council of Europe informed the Secretary General of the Council of Europe that:\r\n\"The Republic of Turkey is exposed to threats to its national security in South East Anatolia which have steadily grown in scope and intensity over the last months so as to amount to a threat to the life of the nation in the meaning of Article 15 of the Convention (art. 15).\r\nDuring 1989, 136 civilians and 153 members of the security forces have been killed by acts of terrorists, acting partly out of foreign bases. Since the beginning of 1990 only, the numbers are 125 civilians and 96 members of the security forces.\r\nThe threat to national security is predominantly occurring in provinces [i.e. Elazig, Bingöl, Tunceli, Van, Diyarbakir, Mardin, Siirt, Hakkâri, Batman and Sirnak] of South East Anatolia and partly also in adjacent provinces.\r\nBecause of the intensity and variety of terrorist actions and in order to cope with such actions, the Government has not only to use its security forces but also take steps appropriate to cope with a campaign of harmful disinformation of the public, partly emerging from other parts of the Republic of Turkey or even from abroad and with abuses of trade-union rights.\r\nTo this end, the Government of Turkey, acting in conformity with Article 121 of the Turkish Constitution, has promulgated on May 10, 1990 the decrees with force of law nos. 424 and 425. These decrees may in part result in derogating from rights enshrined in the following provisions of the European Convention for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: Articles 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 (art. 5, art. 6, art. 8, art. 10, art. 11, art. 13). A descriptive summary of the new measures is attached hereto. The issue of their compatibility with the Turkish Constitution is currently pending before the Constitutional Court of Turkey.\r\nThe Government of Turkey will inform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe when the measures referred to above have ceased to operate.\r\nThis notification is given pursuant to Article 15 (art. 15) of the European Convention of Human Rights.\"\r\nAttached to this letter was a \"descriptive summary of the content of the Decrees which have the force of law nos. 424 and 425\". The only measure therein described relating to Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) was as follows:\r\n\"The Governor of the state of emergency region can order persons who continuously violate the general security and public order, to settle at a place to be specified by the Minister of the Interior outside the state of emergency region for a period which shall not exceed the duration of the state of emergency ...\"\r\n32.   By a letter of 3 January 1991 the Permanent Representative of Turkey informed the Secretary General that Decree no. 430 had been enacted, which limited the powers previously afforded to the Governor of the state of emergency region under Decrees nos. 424 and 425.\r\n33.   On 5 May 1992 the Permanent Representative wrote to the Secretary General that:\r\n\"As most of the measures described in the decrees which have the force of Law nos. 425 and 430 that might result in derogating from rights guaranteed by Articles 5, 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention (art. 5, art. 6, art. 8, art. 10, art. 11, art. 13) are no longer being implemented, I hereby inform you that the Republic of Turkey limits henceforward the scope of its Notice of Derogation with respect to Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) only.  The Derogation with respect to Articles 6, 8, 10, 11 and 13 of the Convention (art. 6, art. 8, art. 10, art. 11, art. 13) is no longer in effect; consequently, the corresponding reference to these Articles (art. 6, art. 8, art. 10, art. 11, art. 13) is hereby deleted from the said Notice of Derogation.\"\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n34.   In his application of 20 May 1993 (no. 21987/93) to the Commission, Mr Aksoy complained that he had been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3) during his detention in police custody in November/December 1992; that, during the course of his detention, he was not brought before a judge or other authorised officer in violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3); and that he was not provided with the opportunity to bring proceedings against those responsible for his ill treatment, in violation of Articles 6 para. 1 and 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13).\r\nFollowing Mr Aksoy’s death on 16 April 1994, his representatives alleged that the killing was a direct result of his application to the Commission and was an interference with his right of individual petition under Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25).\r\n35.   The Commission declared the application admissible on 19 October 1994. In its report of 23 October 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by fifteen votes to one, that there had been a violation of Article 3 (art. 3) and that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3); by thirteen votes to three, that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) and that no separate issue arose under Article 13 (art. 13); and, unanimously, that no further action need be taken in respect of the alleged interference with the effective exercise of the right of individual petition under Article 25 (art. 25).\r\nThe full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n36.   At the hearing, the Government invited the Court to reject the application on the ground that the available domestic remedies had not been exhausted or, in the alternative, to find that there had been no violation of the Convention.\r\n37.   On the same occasion, the applicant asked the Court to find violations of Articles 3, 5, 6, 13 and 25 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 5, art. 6, art. 13, art. 25), and to rule that these breaches had been aggravated because the measures complained of formed part of an administrative practice. He also requested just satisfaction pursuant to Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   THE COURT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE FACTS\r\n38.   The Court recalls its constant case-law that under the Convention system the establishment and verification of the facts is primarily a matter for the Commission (Articles 28 para. 1 and 31) (art. 28-1, art. 31). While the Court is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, it is only in exceptional circumstances that it will exercise its powers in this area (see the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1214, para. 78).\r\n39.   In the instant case, it must be recalled that the Commission reached its findings of fact after a delegation had heard evidence in Turkey on two separate occasions, in addition to hearings in Strasbourg (see paragraph 23 above). In these circumstances, the Court considers that it should accept the facts as established by the Commission (see, mutatis mutandis, the above mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1214, para. 81).\r\n40.   It is thus against the background of the facts as found by the Commission (see paragraph 23 above) that the Court must examine the Government’s preliminary objection and the applicant’s complaints under the Convention.\r\nII.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\r\nA. The arguments of those appearing before the Court\r\n41.   The Government asked the Court to reject the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3) on the ground that, contrary to Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26), he had failed to exhaust the domestic remedies available to him. Article 26 (art. 26) provides:\r\n\"The Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.\"\r\nThe applicant (see paragraph 3 above), with whom the Commission agreed, argued that he had done all that could be expected of him to exhaust domestic remedies.\r\n42.   The Government contended that the rule relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies was clearly established in international law and in the case-law of the Convention organs, and required the applicant to avail himself of all national remedies unless these clearly offered him no chance of success. In fact, Mr Aksoy could have had recourse to three different types of domestic remedy: a criminal prosecution, a civil action and/or administrative proceedings (see paragraphs 24-28 above).\r\n43.   With regard to the first of these options, they submitted that he could have complained about the alleged ill-treatment to the public prosecutor who saw him on 10 December 1992 (see paragraph 18 above). However, according to the Government, Mr Aksoy gave no indication on that occasion or at any time subsequently that he had been ill-treated during his time in police custody.\r\nArticles 243 and 245 of the Criminal Code, which were in force throughout Turkey, penalised the use of torture and ill-treatment for the extraction of confessions (see paragraph 24 above). Legislative Decree no. 285 on the state of emergency region transferred the power to carry out investigations into criminal acts allegedly committed by civil servants from the public prosecutors to the administrative councils (see paragraph 26 above). However, decisions by the administrative councils not to prosecute were always reviewed by the Supreme Administrative Court. In this connection, the Government submitted a number of judgments reversing orders made by administrative councils in the state of emergency region and ordering criminal proceedings to be brought against members of the gendarmerie and security police in respect of allegations of ill-treatment of detainees, and other rulings on sentencing for similar forms of misconduct.\r\n44.   Nonetheless, the Government reasoned that criminal proceedings were perhaps not the most appropriate remedy in this type of case, because of the emphasis placed on the rights of the accused as opposed to those of the complainant. They therefore drew the Court’s attention to the existence of an administrative remedy under Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution (see paragraph 27 above). In order to receive compensation under this provision, an individual needed only to show that there was a causal link between the acts committed by the administration and the wrong suffered; there was no requirement to prove serious misconduct on the part of a government agent. In this connection, the Government submitted examples of administrative decisions in which compensation had been awarded in respect of death caused by torture in police custody.\r\n45.   In addition, the Government argued that Mr Aksoy could have brought a civil action for damages. Again, they referred to a number of decisions of the domestic courts, including a judgment of the Court of Cassation in a case concerning a claim for damages for torture, where it was held that offences committed by members of the security forces were governed by the Code of Obligations and that, under Article 53 of that Code, an acquittal for lack of evidence in criminal proceedings was not binding on the civil courts.\r\n46.   While the applicant did not deny that the remedies identified by the Government were formally part of the Turkish legal system, he claimed that, in the region under emergency rule, they were illusory, inadequate and ineffective because both torture and the denial of effective remedies were carried out as a matter of administrative practice.\r\nIn particular, he argued that reports by a number of international bodies showing that the torture of detainees continued to be systematic and widespread in Turkey raised questions about the commitment of the State to bringing an end to this practice. In this respect he referred to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s Public Statement on Turkey (15 December 1992); the United Nations Committee against Torture’s Summary Account of the Results of the Proceedings Concerning the Inquiry on Turkey (9 November 1993); and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture’s Report of 1995 (E/CN.4/1995/34).\r\n47.   He stated that there was a policy on the part of the State authorities of denying that torture ever took place, which made it extremely difficult for victims to succeed in receiving compensation and in having those responsible brought to justice. For example, it was now impossible for individuals alleging torture to obtain medical reports proving the extent of their injuries, because the forensic medical service had been reorganised and doctors who issued such reports were either threatened or moved to a different area. Prosecutors in the state of emergency region routinely failed to open investigations into alleged abuses of human rights and frequently refused even to acknowledge complaints. Such investigations as were carried out were biased and inadequate. Furthermore, lawyers and others who acted for the victims of human rights violations were subjected to threats, intimidation and abusive prosecutions and individuals were afraid to pursue domestic remedies because reprisals against complainants were so common.\r\nIn these circumstances, the applicant claimed that he should not be required to pursue domestic remedies before making a complaint to Strasbourg.\r\n48.   In any case, he maintained that he had informed the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992 that he had been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and asserted that, even if he had not, the prosecutor could plainly have observed that he did not have the proper use of his hands.\r\nThe failure of the prosecutor to start a criminal investigation made it extremely difficult for the applicant to avail himself of any domestic remedy. It was not possible for him to take steps to ensure that a criminal prosecution was brought, for example by challenging a decision not to bring a prosecution in the administrative courts (see paragraph 26 above), because the lack of investigation meant that no formal decision not to prosecute was ever made. In addition, this failure prejudiced his chances of victory in civil or administrative proceedings, because in order to succeed with either type of claim it would have been necessary to prove that he had suffered torture, and in practice a ruling to that effect by a judge in criminal proceedings would have been required.\r\n49.   Finally, he reminded the Court that no remedy was available even in theory in relation to his complaint regarding the length of time he was detained without judicial control, since this was perfectly lawful under the domestic legislation (see paragraph 29 above).\r\n50.   The Commission was of the opinion that the applicant had been injured during his time in police custody (see paragraph 23 above). It followed that, although it was not possible to establish exactly what happened during his meeting with the public prosecutor on 10 December 1992, there must undoubtedly have been elements which should have prompted the latter to open an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information about the applicant’s state of health and the treatment to which he had been subjected. The applicant had done all that could be expected of him in the circumstances, particularly in view of the facts that he must have felt vulnerable as a result of his detention and ill treatment and that he suffered health problems requiring hospitalisation following his release. The threats which he claimed to have received after making his application to the Commission and his death in circumstances which had not been fully clarified, were further elements which supported the view that the pursuance of remedies might have been attended by risks.\r\nIn view of its finding that the applicant had done all that could be required of him to exhaust domestic remedies, the Commission decided that it was not necessary to determine whether there was an administrative practice on the part of the Turkish authorities of tolerating human rights abuses.\r\nB. The Court’s assessment\r\n51.   The Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. The rule is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13) - with which it has close affinity -, that there is an effective remedy available in respect of the alleged breach in the domestic system whether or not the provisions of the Convention are incorporated in national law. In this way, it is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1210, para. 65).\r\n52.   Under Article 26 (art. 26), normal recourse should be had by an applicant to remedies which are available and sufficient to afford redress in respect of the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies in question must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness.\r\nHowever, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. In addition, according to the \"generally recognised rules of international law\" to which Article 26 (art. 26) makes reference, there may be special circumstances which absolve the applicant from the obligation to exhaust the domestic remedies at his disposal. The rule is also inapplicable where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1210, paras. 66 and 67).\r\n53.   The Court emphasises that its approach to the application of the rule must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; in reviewing whether it has been observed it is essential to have regard to the particular circumstances of each individual case. This means amongst other things that it must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting Party concerned but also of the general legal and political context in which they operate, as well as the personal circumstances of the applicant (see the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others judgment, p. 1211, para. 69).\r\n54.   The Court notes the provision under Turkish law of criminal, civil and administrative remedies against the ill-treatment of detainees by the agents of the State and it has studied with interest the summaries of judgments dealing with similar matters provided by the Government (see paragraphs 43-45 above). However, as previously mentioned (paragraph 53), it is not here solely concerned with the question whether the domestic remedies were in general effective or adequate; it must also examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him to exhaust the national channels of redress.\r\n55.   For the purposes of this examination, the Court reiterates that it has decided to accept the Commission’s findings of fact in the present case (see paragraphs 39-40 above). The Commission, as has been seen (in paragraph 50 above), was of the view that the applicant was suffering from bilateral radial paralysis at the time of his interview with the public prosecutor.\r\n56.   The Court considers that, even if it were accepted that the applicant made no complaint to the public prosecutor of ill-treatment in police custody, the injuries he had sustained must have been clearly visible during their meeting. However, the prosecutor chose to make no enquiry as to the nature, extent and cause of these injuries, despite the fact that in Turkish law he was under a duty to investigate (see paragraph 26 above).\r\nIt must be recalled that this omission on the part of the prosecutor took place after Mr Aksoy had been detained in police custody for at least fourteen days without access to legal or medical assistance or support. During this time he had sustained severe injuries requiring hospital treatment (see paragraph 23 above). These circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the representatives of the State. Having seen that the public prosecutor was aware of his injuries but had taken no action, it is understandable if the applicant formed the belief that he could not hope to secure concern and satisfaction through national legal channels.\r\n57.   The Court therefore concludes that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from his obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. Having reached this conclusion it does not consider it necessary to examine the applicant’s claim that there exists an administrative practice of withholding remedies in breach of the Convention.\r\nIII.   THE MERITS\r\nA. Alleged violation of Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3)\r\n58.   The applicant alleged that he was subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3), which states:\r\n\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"\r\nThe Government considered the allegations of ill-treatment to be unfounded. The Commission, however, found that the applicant had been tortured.\r\n59.   The Government raised various objections to the way in which the Commission had evaluated the evidence. They pointed to a number of factors which, in their view, should have given rise to serious doubt as to whether Mr Aksoy had been ill-treated as he claimed.\r\nFor example, they questioned why the applicant had made no complaint to the public prosecutor about having been tortured (see paragraph 18 above) and found it difficult to understand why, if he had indeed been subjected to torture, he had not made any inculpatory confession. They also found it suspicious that he had waited for five days between being released from police custody and contacting the hospital (see paragraph 19 above) and observed that it could not be assumed that nothing untoward had occurred in the meantime. Finally, they raised a number of points relating to the medical evidence, including the facts that the applicant took his medical records with him when he left hospital and that there was no medical evidence of burns or other marks left by the application of electric shocks.\r\n60.   The applicant complained of having been ill-treated in different ways. He claimed to have been kept blindfolded during interrogation, which caused disorientation; to have been suspended from his arms, which were tied together behind his back (\"Palestinian hanging\"); to have been given electric shocks, which were exacerbated by throwing water over him; and to have been subjected to beatings, slapping and verbal abuse. He referred to medical evidence from Dicle University Medical Faculty which showed that he was suffering from a bilateral brachial plexus injury at the time of his admission to hospital (see paragraph 19 above). This injury was consistent with Palestinian hanging.\r\nHe submitted that the treatment complained of was sufficiently severe as to amount to torture; it was inflicted with the purpose of inducing him to admit that he knew the man who had identified him.\r\nIn addition, he contended that the conditions in which he was detained (see paragraph 13 above) and the constant fear of torture which he suffered while in custody amounted to inhuman treatment.\r\n61.   The Court, having decided to accept the Commission’s findings of fact (see paragraphs 39-40 above), considers that where an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation as to the causing of the injury, failing which a clear issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3) (see the Tomasi v. France judgment of 27 August 1992, Series A no. 241-A, pp. 40-41, paras. 108-111 and the Ribitsch v. Austria judgment of 4 December 1995, Series A no. 336, p. 26, para. 34).\r\n62.   Article 3 (art. 3), as the Court has observed on many occasions, enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against organised terrorism and crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Unlike most of the substantive clauses of the Convention and of Protocols Nos. 1 and 4 (P1, P4), Article 3 (art. 3) makes no provision for exceptions and no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) even in the event of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, para. 163, the Soering v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, p. 34, para. 88, and the Chahal v. the United Kingdom judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, p. 1855, para. 79).\r\n63.   In order to determine whether any particular form of ill-treatment should be qualified as torture, the Court must have regard to the distinction drawn in Article 3 (art. 3) between this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. As it has remarked before, this distinction would appear to have been embodied in the Convention to allow the special stigma of \"torture\" to attach only to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment previously cited, p. 66, para. 167).\r\n64.   The Court recalls that the Commission found, inter alia, that the applicant was subjected to \"Palestinian hanging\", in other words, that he was stripped naked, with his arms tied together behind his back, and suspended by his arms (see paragraph 23 above).\r\nIn the view of the Court this treatment could only have been deliberately inflicted; indeed, a certain amount of preparation and exertion would have been required to carry it out. It would appear to have been administered with the aim of obtaining admissions or information from the applicant. In addition to the severe pain which it must have caused at the time, the medical evidence shows that it led to a paralysis of both arms which lasted for some time (see paragraph 23 above). The Court considers that this treatment was of such a serious and cruel nature that it can only be described as torture.\r\nIn view of the gravity of this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Court to examine the applicant’s complaints of other forms of ill-treatment.\r\nIn conclusion, there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3).\r\nB. Alleged violation of Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention (art. 5-3)\r\n65.   The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, claimed that his detention violated Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention (art. 5-3). The relevant parts of Article 5 (art. 5) state:\r\n\"1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\r\n...\r\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...\r\n...\r\n3. Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article (art. 5-1-c) shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power ...\"\r\n66.   The Court recalls its decision in the case of Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 B, p. 33, para. 62), that a period of detention without judicial control of four days and six hours fell outside the strict constraints as to time permitted by Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3). It clearly follows that the period of fourteen or more days during which Mr Aksoy was detained without being brought before a judge or other judicial officer did not satisfy the requirement of \"promptness\".\r\n67.   However, the Government submitted that, despite these considerations, there had been no violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), in view of Turkey’s derogation under Article 15 of the Convention (art. 15), which states:\r\n\"1. In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its obligations under [the] Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.\r\n2. No derogation from Article 2 (art. 2), except in respect of deaths resulting from lawful acts of war, or from Articles 3, 4 (paragraph 1) and 7 (art. 3, art. 4-1, art. 7) shall be made under this provision (art. 15-1).\r\n3. Any High Contracting Party availing itself of this right of derogation shall keep the Secretary General of the Council of Europe fully informed of the measures which it has taken and the reasons therefor. It shall also inform the Secretary General of the Council of Europe when such measures have ceased to operate and the provisions of the Convention are again being fully executed.\"\r\nThe Government reminded the Court that Turkey had derogated from its obligations under Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) on 5 May 1992 (see paragraph 33 above).\r\n1. The Court’s approach\r\n68.   The Court recalls that it falls to each Contracting State, with its responsibility for \"the life of [its] nation\", to determine whether that life is threatened by a \"public emergency\" and, if so, how far it is necessary to go in attempting to overcome the emergency. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the pressing needs of the moment, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to decide both on the presence of such an emergency and on the nature and scope of the derogations necessary to avert it. Accordingly, in this matter a wide margin of appreciation should be left to the national authorities.\r\nNonetheless, Contracting Parties do not enjoy an unlimited discretion. It is for the Court to rule whether, inter alia, the States have gone beyond the \"extent strictly required by the exigencies\" of the crisis. The domestic margin of appreciation is thus accompanied by a European supervision. In exercising this supervision, the Court must give appropriate  weight to such relevant factors as the nature of the rights affected by the derogation and the circumstances leading to, and the duration of, the emergency situation (see the Brannigan and McBride v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258-B, pp. 49-50, para. 43).\r\n2. Existence of a public emergency threatening the life of the nation\r\n69.   The Government, with whom the Commission agreed on this point, maintained that there was a public emergency \"threatening the life of the nation\" in South-East Turkey. The applicant did not contest the issue, although he submitted that, essentially, it was a matter for the Convention organs to decide.\r\n70.   The Court considers, in the light of all the material before it, that the particular extent and impact of PKK terrorist activity in South-East Turkey has undoubtedly created, in the region concerned, a \"public emergency threatening the life of the nation\" (see, mutatis mutandis, the Lawless v. Ireland judgment of 1 July 1961, Series A no. 3, p. 56, para. 28, the above-mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, p. 78, para. 205, and the above-mentioned Brannigan and McBride judgment, p. 50, para. 47).\r\n3. Whether the measures were strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\r\na) The length of the unsupervised detention\r\n71.   The Government asserted that the applicant had been arrested on 26 November 1992 along with thirteen others on suspicion of aiding and abetting PKK terrorists, being a member of the Kiziltepe branch of the PKK and distributing PKK tracts (see paragraph 12 above). He was held in custody for fourteen days, in accordance with Turkish law, which allows a person detained in connection with a collective offence to be held for up to thirty days in the state of emergency region (see paragraph 29 above).\r\n72.   They explained that the place in which the applicant was arrested and detained fell within the area covered by the Turkish derogation (see paragraphs 31-33 above). This derogation was necessary and justified, in view of the extent and gravity of PKK terrorism in Turkey, particularly in the South East. The investigation of terrorist offences presented the authorities with special problems, as the Court had recognised in the past, because the members of terrorist organisations were expert in withstanding interrogation, had secret support networks and access to substantial resources. A great deal of time and effort was required to secure and verify evidence in a large region confronted with a terrorist organisation that had strategic and technical support from neighbouring countries. These difficulties meant that it was impossible to provide judicial supervision during a suspect’s detention in police custody.\r\n73.   The applicant submitted that he was detained on 24 November 1992 and released on 10 December 1992. He alleged that the post-dating of arrests was a common practice in the state of emergency region.\r\n74.   While he did not present detailed arguments against the validity of the Turkish derogation as a whole, he questioned whether the situation in South-East Turkey necessitated the holding of suspects for fourteen days or more without judicial supervision. He submitted that judges in South-East Turkey would not be put at risk if they were permitted and required to review the legality of detention at shorter intervals.\r\n75.   The Commission could not establish with any certainty whether the applicant was first detained on 24 November 1992, as he claimed, or on 26 November 1992, as alleged by the Government, and it therefore proceeded on the basis that he was held for at least fourteen days without being brought before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power.\r\n76.   The Court would stress the importance of Article 5 (art. 5) in the Convention system: it enshrines a fundamental human right, namely the protection of the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his or her right to liberty. Judicial control of interferences by the executive with the individual’s right to liberty is an essential feature of the guarantee embodied in Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), which is intended to minimise the risk of arbitrariness and to ensure the rule of law (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, p. 32, para. 58). Furthermore, prompt judicial intervention may lead to the detection and prevention of serious ill treatment, which, as stated above (paragraph 62), is prohibited by the Convention in absolute and non-derogable terms.\r\n77.   In the Brannigan and McBride judgment (cited at paragraph 68 above), the Court held that the United Kingdom Government had not exceeded their margin of appreciation by derogating from their obligations under Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) to the extent that individuals suspected of terrorist offences were allowed to be held for up to seven days without judicial control.\r\nIn the instant case, the applicant was detained for at least fourteen days without being brought before a judge or other officer. The Government have sought to justify this measure by reference to the particular demands of police investigations in a geographically vast area faced with a terrorist organisation receiving outside support (see paragraph 72 above).\r\n78.   Although the Court is of the view - which it has expressed on several occasions in the past (see, for example, the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment) - that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems, it cannot accept that it is necessary to hold a suspect for fourteen days without judicial intervention. This period is exceptionally long, and left the applicant vulnerable not only to arbitrary interference with his right to liberty but also to torture (see paragraph 64 above). Moreover, the Government have not adduced any detailed reasons before the Court as to why the fight against terrorism in South-East Turkey rendered judicial intervention impracticable.\r\nb) Safeguards\r\n79.   The Government emphasised that both the derogation and the national legal system provided sufficient safeguards to protect human rights. Thus, the derogation itself was limited to the strict minimum required for the fight against terrorism; the permissible length of detention was prescribed by law and the consent of a public prosecutor was necessary if the police wished to remand a suspect in custody beyond these periods. Torture was prohibited by Article 243 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 24 above) and Article 135 (a) stipulated that any statement made in consequence of the administration of torture or any other form of ill treatment would have no evidential weight.\r\n80.   The applicant pointed out that long periods of unsupervised detention, together with the lack of safeguards provided for the protection of prisoners, facilitated the practice of torture. Thus, he was tortured with particular intensity on his third and fourth days in detention, and was held thereafter to allow his injuries to heal; throughout this time he was denied access to either a lawyer or a doctor. Moreover, he was kept blindfolded during interrogation, which meant that he could not identify those who mistreated him. The reports of Amnesty International (\"Turkey: a Policy of Denial\", February 1995), the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the United Nations Committee against Torture (cited at paragraph 46 above) showed that the safeguards contained in the Turkish Criminal Code, which were in any case inadequate, were routinely ignored in the state of emergency region.\r\n81.   The Commission considered that the Turkish system offered insufficient safeguards to detainees, for example there appeared to be no speedy remedy of habeas corpus and no legally enforceable rights of access to a lawyer, doctor, friend or relative. In these circumstances, despite the serious terrorist threat in South-East Turkey, the measure which allowed the applicant to be detained for at least fourteen days without being brought before a judge or other officer exercising judicial functions exceeded the Government’s margin of appreciation and could not be said to be strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.\r\n82.   In its above-mentioned Brannigan and McBride judgment (cited at paragraph 68), the Court was satisfied that there were effective safeguards in operation in Northern Ireland which provided an important measure of protection against arbitrary behaviour and incommunicado detention. For example, the remedy of habeas corpus was available to test the lawfulness of the original arrest and detention, there was an absolute and legally enforceable right to consult a solicitor forty-eight hours after the time of arrest and detainees were entitled to inform a relative or friend about their detention and to have access to a doctor (op. cit., pp. 55-56, paras. 62-63).\r\n83.   In contrast, however, the Court considers that in this case insufficient safeguards were available to the applicant, who was detained over a long period of time. In particular, the denial of access to a lawyer, doctor, relative or friend and the absence of any realistic possibility of being brought before a court to test the legality of the detention meant that he was left completely at the mercy of those holding him.\r\n84.   The Court has taken account of the unquestionably serious problem of terrorism in South-East Turkey and the difficulties faced by the State in taking effective measures against it. However, it is not persuaded that the exigencies of the situation necessitated the holding of the applicant on suspicion of involvement in terrorist offences for fourteen days or more in incommunicado detention without access to a judge or other judicial officer.\r\n4. Whether the Turkish derogation met the formal requirements of Article 15 para. 3 (art. 15-3)\r\n85.   None of those appearing before the Court contested that the Turkish Republic’s notice of derogation (see paragraph 33 above) complied with the formal requirements of Article 15 para. 3 (art. 15-3), namely to keep the Secretary General of the Council of Europe fully informed of the measures which were taken in derogation from the Convention and the reasons therefor.\r\n86.   The Court is competent to examine this issue of its own motion (see the above-mentioned Lawless judgment, p. 55, para. 22, and the above mentioned Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment, p. 84, para. 223), and in particular whether the Turkish notice of derogation contained sufficient information about the measure in question, which allowed the applicant to be detained for at least fourteen days without judicial control, to satisfy the requirements of Article 15 para. 3 (art. 15-3). However, in view of its finding that the impugned measure was not strictly required by the exigencies of the situation (see paragraph 84 above), the Court finds it unnecessary to rule on this matter.\r\n5. Conclusion\r\n87.   In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention (art. 5-3).\r\nC. Alleged lack of remedy\r\n88.   The applicant complained that he was denied access to a court, in violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1), which provides, so far as is relevant:\r\n\"In the determination of his civil rights ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law\r\n...\"\r\nIn addition, he claimed that there was no effective domestic remedy available to him, contrary to Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13), which states:\r\n\"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\"\r\n89.   The Government contended that, since the applicant had never even attempted to bring proceedings, it was not open to him to complain that he had been denied access to a court. They further argued, as they had in connection with their preliminary objection (see paragraphs 41-45 above) that there were a number of effective remedies available.\r\n90.   For the applicant, the prosecutor’s decision not to open an investigation had effectively rendered it impossible for him to enforce his civil right to compensation (see paragraph 48 above). He submitted that, under Turkish law, civil proceedings could not be contemplated until the facts concerning the events had been established and the perpetrators identified by a criminal prosecution. Without this, civil proceedings had no prospect of success. In addition, he stated that the ability to seek compensation for torture would represent only one part of the measures necessary to provide redress; it would be unacceptable for a State to claim that it fulfilled its obligation simply by providing compensation, since this would in effect be to allow States to pay for the right to torture. He claimed that the remedies necessary to meet his Convention claims either did not exist, even in theory, or did not operate effectively in practice (see paragraphs 46-47 above).\r\n91.   The Commission found a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), for the same reasons that it found in the applicant’s favour under Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) (see paragraph 50 above). In view of this finding, it did not consider it necessary to examine the complaint under Article 13 (art. 13).\r\n1. Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6-1)\r\n92.   The Court recalls that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) embodies the \"right to a court\", of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before a court in civil matters, constitutes one aspect (see, for example, the Holy Monasteries v. Greece judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A, pp. 36-37, para. 80). There can be no doubt that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) applies to a civil claim for compensation in respect of ill treatment allegedly committed by agents of the State (see, for example, the Tomasi judgment cited at paragraph 61 above, p. 43, paras. 121-22).\r\n93.   The Court notes that it was not disputed by the applicant that he could in theory have brought civil proceedings for damages in respect of his ill-treatment. He did claim that the failure of the prosecutor to mount a criminal investigation in practice meant that he would have had no chance of success in civil proceedings (see paragraph 90 above). The Court recalls, however, that because of the special circumstances which existed in his case (see paragraph 57 above), Mr Aksoy did not even attempt to make an application before the civil courts. Given these facts, it is not possible for the Court to determine whether or not the Turkish civil courts would have been able to deal with Mr Aksoy’s claim, had he brought it before them.\r\nIn any event, the Court observes that the crux of the applicant’s complaint concerned the prosecutor’s failure to mount a criminal investigation (see paragraph 90 above). It further notes the applicant’s argument that the possibility of seeking compensation for torture would represent only one part of the measures necessary to provide redress (also in paragraph 90 above).\r\n94.   In the Court’s view, against this background, it is more appropriate to consider this complaint in relation to the more general obligation on States under Article 13 (art. 13) to provide an effective remedy in respect of violations of the Convention.\r\n2. Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13)\r\n95.   The Court observes that Article 13 (art. 13) guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of this Article (art. 13) is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent national authority both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their obligations under this provision (art. 13) (see the Chahal judgment cited at paragraph 62 above, pp. 1869-70, para. 145). The scope of the obligation under Article 13 (art. 13) varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention (see the above-mentioned Chahal judgment, pp. 1870-71, paras. 150-51). Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 (art. 13) must be \"effective\" in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State.\r\n96.   The Court would first make it clear that its finding (in paragraph 57 above) that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from his obligation to exhaust domestic remedies should not be taken as meaning that remedies are ineffective in South-East Turkey (see, mutatis mutandis, the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, pp. 1213-14, para. 77).\r\n97.   Secondly, the Court, like the Commission, would take judicial notice of the fact that allegations of torture in police custody are extremely difficult for the victim to substantiate if he has been isolated from the outside world, without access to doctors, lawyers, family or friends who could provide support and assemble the necessary evidence. Furthermore, having been ill-treated in this way, an individual will often have had his capacity or will to pursue a complaint impaired.\r\n98.   The nature of the right safeguarded under Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3) has implications for Article 13 (art. 13). Given the fundamental importance of the prohibition of torture (see paragraph 62 above) and the especially vulnerable position of torture victims, Article 13 (art. 13) imposes, without prejudice to any other remedy available under the domestic system, an obligation on States to carry out a thorough and effective investigation of incidents of torture.\r\nAccordingly, as regards Article 13 (art. 13), where an individual has an arguable claim that he has been tortured by agents of the State, the notion of an \"effective remedy\" entails, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigatory procedure. It is true that no express provision exists in the Convention such as can be found in Article 12 of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which imposes a duty to proceed to a \"prompt and impartial\" investigation whenever there is a reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed. However, in the Court’s view, such a requirement is implicit in the notion of an \"effective remedy\" under Article 13 (art. 13) (see, mutatis mutandis, the Soering judgment cited at paragraph 62 above, pp. 34-35, para. 88).\r\n99.   Indeed, under Turkish law the prosecutor was under a duty to carry out an investigation. However, and whether or not Mr Aksoy made an explicit complaint to him, he ignored the visible evidence before him that the latter had been tortured (see paragraph 56 above) and no investigation took place. No evidence has been adduced before the Court to show that any other action was taken, despite the prosecutor’s awareness of the applicant’s injuries.\r\nMoreover, in the Court’s view, in the circumstances of Mr Aksoy’s case, such an attitude from a State official under a duty to investigate criminal offences was tantamount to undermining the effectiveness of any other remedies that may have existed.\r\n100.   Accordingly, in view in particular of the lack of any investigation, the Court finds that the applicant was denied an effective remedy in respect of his allegation of torture.\r\nIn conclusion, there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13).\r\nD. Alleged violation of Article 25 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 25-1)\r\n101.   The applicant alleged that there had been an interference with his right of individual petition, in breach of Article 25 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 25-1), which states:\r\n\"The Commission may receive petitions addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in this Convention, provided that the High Contracting Party against which the complaint has been lodged has declared that it recognises the competence of the Commission to receive such petitions. Those of the High Contracting Parties who have made such a declaration undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.\"\r\n102.   It is to be recalled that Mr Aksoy was killed on 16 April 1994; according to his representatives, this was a direct result of his persisting with his application to the Commission. It was alleged that he had been threatened with death in order to make him withdraw his application to the Commission, the last threat being made by telephone on 14 April 1994 (see paragraph 22 above).\r\n103.   The Government, however, denied that there had been any interference with the right of individual petition. They submitted that Mr Aksoy had been killed in a settling of scores between quarrelling PKK factions and told the Court that a suspect had been charged with his murder (see paragraph 22 above).\r\n104.   The Commission was deeply concerned by Mr Aksoy’s death and the allegation that it was connected to his application to Strasbourg. Nonetheless, it did not have any evidence on which to form a conclusion as to the truth of this claim or the responsibility for the killing.\r\n105.   The Court reiterates that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) that applicants or potential applicants are able to communicate freely with the Commission without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see the Akdivar and Others judgment cited at paragraph 38 above, p. 1219, para. 105).\r\n106.   That being so, in the present case the Commission was unable to find any evidence to show that Mr Aksoy’s death was connected with his application, or that the State authorities had been responsible for any interference, in the form of threats or intimidation, with his rights under Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1), and no new evidence in this connection was presented to the Court.\r\nThe Court cannot therefore find that there has been a violation of Article 25 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 25-1).\r\nE. Alleged administrative practice of violating the Convention\r\n107.   The applicant additionally asked the Court to rule that Articles 3, 5 para. 3, 6 para. 1, 13 and 25 para. 1 (art. 3, art. 5-3, art. 6-1, art. 13, art. 25 1) were violated as a matter of practice in South-East Turkey, with high level official tolerance. This entailed that the Court should find aggravated violations of the Convention.\r\n108.   With reference to the reports of the international bodies cited above (paragraph 46), he argued that torture at the hands of the police was widespread in Turkey and that this had been the case for many years. The State authorities were aware of the problem but had chosen not to implement recommended safeguards.\r\nFurthermore, the victims of torture and of other human rights abuses were routinely denied access to judicial remedies in breach of Articles 6 para. 1 and 13 of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 13) and were harassed, threatened and subjected to violence if they attempted to bring their complaints before the Strasbourg organs, contrary to Article 25 para. 1 (art. 25-1).\r\nFinally, since the domestic law permitted suspects to be detained for long periods in violation of Article 5 para. 3 (art. 5-3), this was evidence of an administrative practice of breaching that provision (art. 5-3).\r\n109.   The Court is of the view that the evidence established by the Commission is insufficient to allow it to reach a conclusion concerning the existence of any administrative practice of the violation of the above Articles of the Convention (art. 3, art. 5-3, art. 6-1, art. 13, art. 25-1).\r\nIV.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (ART. 50)\r\n110.   Under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50),\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\r\n111.   In his memorial the applicant claimed compensation for pecuniary damage caused by his detention and torture, consisting of medical expenses of 16,635,000 Turkish liras and loss of earnings amounting to £40 (sterling).\r\nIn addition he sought non-pecuniary damages of £25,000, which, he submitted, should be increased by a further £25,000 in the event that the Court found an aggravated violation of the Convention on the grounds of administrative practice.\r\nHe also requested payment of his legal fees and expenses which totalled £20,710.\r\n112.   The Government offered no comment either in its memorial or during the hearing before the Court as regards these claims.\r\nA. Damage\r\n113.   In view of the extremely serious violations of the Convention suffered by Mr Zeki Aksoy and the anxiety and distress that these undoubtedly caused to his father, who has continued with the application after his son’s death (see paragraph 3 above), the Court has decided to award the full amounts of compensation sought as regards pecuniary and non pecuniary damage. In total this amounts to 4,283,450,000 (four thousand two hundred and eighty-three million, four hundred and fifty thousand) Turkish liras (based on the rate of exchange applicable on the date of adoption of the present judgment).\r\nB. Costs and expenses\r\n114.   The Court considers that the applicant’s claim for costs and expenses is reasonable and awards it in full, less the amounts received by way of legal aid from the Council of Europe which have not already been taken into account in the claim.\r\nC. Default interest\r\n115.   With regard to the sum awarded in Turkish liras, default interest is to be payable at the rate of 30% per annum, which, according to the information available to the Court, is the statutory rate of interest applicable in Turkey at the date of adoption of the present judgment.\r\nAs the award in respect of costs and expenses is to be made in pounds sterling, the Court considers it appropriate that interest should be payable on this sum at the rate of 8% per annum, which, according to the information available to it, is the statutory rate applicable in England and Wales at the date of adoption of the present judgment.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\r\n1.   Dismisses by eight votes to one the preliminary objection concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies;\r\n\r\n2.   Holds by eight votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3);\r\n\r\n3.   Holds by eight votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention (art. 5-3);\r\n\r\n4.   Holds by eight votes to one that it is not necessary to consider the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 6 1);\r\n\r\n5.   Holds by eight votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13);\r\n6.   Holds unanimously that no violation of Article 25 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 25-1) has been established;\r\n\r\n7.   Holds by eight votes to one\r\na) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, in respect of compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, 4,283,450,000 (four thousand two hundred and eighty-three million, four hundred and fifty thousand) Turkish liras;\r\nb) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, in respect of costs and expenses, £20,710 (twenty thousand seven hundred and ten pounds sterling) less 12,515 (twelve thousand, five hundred and fifteen) French francs to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment;\r\nc) that simple interest at the following annual rates shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement:\r\n(i) 30% in relation to the sum awarded in Turkish liras;\r\n(ii) 8% in relation to the sum awarded in pounds sterling.\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 18 December 1996.\r\n\r\nRolv RYSSDAL\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\r\n- partly dissenting opinion of Judge de Meyer;\r\n- dissenting opinion of Judge Gölcüklü.\r\n\r\nR.R.\r\nH.P.\r\n \r\n \r\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\r\n(Translation)\r\nAlthough I agree with the rest of the judgment, I disagree with the line taken by the majority in respect of Articles 6 para. 1 and 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13).\r\nIn the present case the Court had to rule firstly on a preliminary objection that domestic remedies had not been exhausted.\r\nIt is clear from the reasoning on this in paragraphs 51 to 57 of the judgment that in the applicant’s case these remedies were purely theoretical. This suggests a violation of Article 13 (art. 13), as is later made explicit in different terms in paragraphs 95 to 100 of the judgment. The present case thus shows up very clearly the link between Article 13 and Article 26 (art. 13, art. 26) .\r\nThe reasoning also, however, implies a fortiori that the applicant’s right of access to a court was not effectively secured .\r\nIt follows that, in line with the decision we took on the preliminary objection, we should as a logical consequence have found that there had been a violation of both Article 6 para. 1 and Article 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13).\r\nIt would have sufficed if we had noted that it was clear from the considerations set out in paragraphs 51 to 57 of the judgment that in the circumstances of the case the applicant had no effective domestic remedies and was unable to exercise his right of access to a court.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE GÖLCÜKLÜ\r\n(Translation)\r\n1.   With regard to the subsidiary nature of the protection system set up by the European Convention on Human Rights and its direct corollary, the exhaustion of domestic remedies, I refer to my dissenting opinion in the case of Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (see the judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV).\r\n2.   I would point out that Article 17 of the Turkish Constitution is a literal translation of Article 3 (art. 3) of the European Convention on Human Rights and that torture and ill-treatment attract heavy penalties under the Turkish Criminal Code (Articles 243 and 245) (criminal remedy).\r\n3.   As civil wrongs (unlawful acts), torture and ill-treatment open up the possibility of an action for compensation in respect of pecuniary or non pecuniary damage (civil action or administrative proceedings, depending on the perpetrator’s status).\r\n4.   Criminal proceedings are instituted by the prosecuting authorities of their own motion or on the lodging of a complaint, and must be brought where there is sufficient evidence that an offence has been committed.\r\n5.   In Turkish law, therefore, these three remedies are available equally, throughout the country, to every person who claims to be the victim of torture or ill-treatment.\r\n6.   With regard to the effectiveness and appropriateness of the above mentioned remedies, there is not the shadow of a doubt in my mind. In this connection I refer to my dissenting opinion in the case of Akdivar and Others (ibid.). The respondent Government, both in that case and the present case, submitted to the Commission in the first place and later to the European Court - both in their memorial and at the public hearing - dozens of judgments of the courts of first instance or the supreme courts such as the Court of Cassation or the Supreme Administrative Court.\r\n7.   Most of these judgments concerned cases in south-eastern Turkey where acts of terrorism are being committed and where the present case occurred. The following examples give a brief summary of some of these decisions.\r\n- Second Division of the Supreme Administrative Court - judgment of 23 March 1994\r\nThe Supreme Administrative Court, carrying out its statutory review of the decision to discontinue proceedings made by the Malatya Provincial Administrative Council, ruled that criminal proceedings under Article 245 of the Criminal Code (ill-treatment, recourse to violence by a public official empowered to use force in accordance with the law) had to be brought against the accused, four police officers of the Malatya Security Police who had allegedly beaten a suspect while he was being questioned.\r\nAnother judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court to the same effect (judgment of 7.10.1993) concerned the Adiyaman province. These two regions (Malatya and Adiyaman) are in south-eastern Turkey.\r\n- Eighth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation - judgment of 16 December 1987\r\nThe accused were sentenced to four years, five months and ten days’ imprisonment for causing death by acts of torture (Articles 452/1 and 243/1 2 of the Criminal Code).\r\nThe Court of Cassation upheld these sentences imposed by the First Division of the Mardin Assize Court (in south-eastern Turkey).\r\n- Eighth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation - judgment of 25 September 1991\r\nThe Eighth Division of the Ankara Assize Court sentenced the accused to four years and two months’ imprisonment and banned them from holding public office for two months and fifteen days for inflicting ill-treatment with a view to extracting confessions.\r\nThe Court of Cassation held that, as the file stood, the expert reports formed a sufficient basis for the lower court’s judgment. However, it quashed it on account of a clerical error, as it stated that the court had applied the minimum sentence whereas it had based its calculations on the minimum sentence.\r\n- Eighth Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation - judgment of 21 February 1990\r\nThe accused were sentenced to four years, five months and ten days’ imprisonment for causing a prisoner’s death. This conviction pronounced by the Sixth Division of the Istanbul Assize Court was based on the charge of fatal wounding (Article 452/1 of the Criminal Code).\r\nThe Court of Cassation upheld the conviction but ruled that Article 243, concerning death subsequent to an act of torture, should be applied.\r\n8.   Despite the existence of the three remedies I have mentioned above, the applicant did not make use of any of them but only complained to the Commission via London. He did not even lodge a complaint with the responsible authorities - the first step any individual has a duty to take when he claims to be a victim of anything at all.\r\n9.   I simply cannot agree with the opinion the majority reached on the basis of the applicant’s bare allegations (that the Turkish courts in the region concerned afforded no protection when the acts complained of had been committed by members of the security forces) namely that the effectiveness of domestic remedies was open to doubt. I consider that \"where there is doubt\", and especially where there is doubt, domestic remedies must be exhausted as required by the Commission (decision of 14 March 1985, Garcia v. Switzerland, application no. 10148/82, Decisions and Reports 42, p. 98). And the applicant did nothing of the sort.\r\n10.   As Judge Gotchev rightly noted in his dissenting opinion in the above-mentioned Akdivar and Others case, in connection with the exhaustion-of-domestic-remedies rule, in order to reach such a conclusion after the respondent Government have demonstrated the existence of domestic remedies, the burden of proof should fall (once more) on the applicant, who should be required to prove that the authorities in that region of the country frustrated his attempts to set the appropriate proceedings in motion. The applicant has not adduced any evidence to that effect.\r\n11.   Above all, in this case a number of facts were in dispute between the parties. The applicant alleged that he had reported to the prosecuting authorities when interviewed that he had been subjected to ill-treatment while in police custody, whereas the respondent Government denied this and submitted arguments in support of their contention. The Court, on the basis of this unclarified question of fact, namely the alleged failure of the prosecuting authorities to set criminal proceedings in motion, concluded that the criminal remedy was ineffective.\r\n12.   Apart from the fact that there are procedures in Turkish law whereby the prosecuting authorities can be obliged to institute criminal proceedings, who else, if not the national authorities, could clarify this fact which is decisive for the outcome of the present case? For that reason alone, the applicant’s complaints should first be brought before the Turkish courts so that it can be established whether domestic remedies are effective or not.\r\n13.   Since, therefore, the requirement in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) has not been satisfied, the Court should have upheld the respondent Government’s preliminary objections concerning the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.\r\n14.   The foregoing considerations dispense me from considering the merits of the case.\r\n",

TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\n(Application no. 24561/94)\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n\r\n1 June 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL\r\n\r\n\r\n01/09/2004\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision\r\n \r\nIn the case of Altun v. Turkey,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\r\n\tMrs\tV. STRÁŽNICKÁ, President,\r\n\tMr\tJ. CASADEVALL,\r\n\tMr\tR. MARUSTE,\r\n\tMr\tS. PAVLOVSCHI,\r\n\tMr\tL. GARLICKI,\r\n\tMrs\tE. FURA-SANDSTRÖM judges,\r\n\tMr\tF. GÖLCÜKLÜ, ad hoc judge,\r\nand Mr M. O’BOYLE, Section Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 11 May 2004,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:\r\n\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.  The case originated in an application (no. 24561/94) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Turkish national, Mr Abdullah Altun (“the applicant”), on 30 June 1994.\r\n2.  The applicant was represented by Mr Boyle and Ms Hampson, lawyers in the United Kingdom. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an Agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\r\n3.  The applicant alleged that State security forces had destroyed his family home and possessions in the village of Akdoruk at the end of 1993. He relied on Articles 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention.\r\n4.  The application was declared admissible by the Commission on 11 September 1995. Delegates of the Commission then took oral evidence at a hearing in Ankara between 28 June to 2 July 1999.\r\n5.  The case was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 § 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.\r\n6.  The application was allocated to the Fourth Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr R. Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr F. Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\r\n7.  The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine). The parties replied in writing to each other’s observations.\r\n8.  On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\r\nTHE FACTS\r\nI.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n9.  The applicant was born in 1933 and lives in Diyarbakır. Until the end of 1993, the applicant lived in the village of Akdoruk, attached to the Kulp District in the province of Diyarbakır. The applicant left and has never returned to the village after the alleged incident.\r\nA.  The facts\r\n10.  The facts surrounding the destruction of the applicant’s house and property are in dispute between the parties.\r\n1.  Facts as presented by the applicant\r\n11.  Early in the morning of 11 November 1993 the applicant left his house and went to the fields to work. At about 7 a.m. a large number of soldiers arrived in the village of Akdoruk on foot. The soldiers had a list of names in their hands and started burning down some of the houses. From the field, the applicant saw that his house was on fire. The applicant’s wife tried to save some of their belongings and animals however she was prevented by the gendarmes who hit her with the butt of their rifles. In all, the soldiers burned down six houses in the village.\r\n12.  The applicant tried to go back to the village but was prevented by his wife, who told him that if he went back he would be arrested by the soldiers. The soldiers arrested ten villagers and sent them to the gendarmerie station. After spending the night in the village, the soldiers left Akdoruk village early in the morning of 12 November 1993.\r\n13.  The applicant spent the night at his sister’s house and then went to Diyarbakır to live with his daughter.\r\n14.  In February 1994, the applicant went to the Kulp Magistrate’s Court together with Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir to lodge a petition about the burning of his house. All three of them submitted handwritten petitions to the judge and requested him to conduct a visit to the village to establish the damage they had suffered. The judge however refused their request for security reasons. The same day, the applicant and the two other villagers were called to the public prosecutor’s office in Kulp, where they were interrogated about their complaints. The public prosecutor took their statements and typed down their complaints. The applicant, Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir, signed these petitions without understanding the content, as they were illiterate.\r\n15.  The applicant later learnt from his friends that these petitions had been transferred to the Kulp District Gendarmerie whose officers the applicant considered responsible for the destruction of his house. He was informed that the gendarmes were looking for him however he was too frightened to go to the gendarmerie headquarters, because the other two villagers, who had also lodged a petition with him, had also been summoned to the gendarmerie and had been severely beaten.\r\n16.  In the beginning of 1994 the gendarmes returned to the Akdoruk village and burned down the remaining houses.\r\n17.  The applicant is currently unemployed and occasionally works as a builder in constructions.\r\n2.  Facts as presented by the Government\r\n18.  No military operation was conducted in or around the village of Akdoruk on 11 November 1993. Subsequent to the applicant’s complaint with the Kulp public prosecutor, an investigation was commenced into the allegations of the applicant. On 22 August 1994 the Kulp public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and transferred the case to the Kulp Administrative Council pursuant to the Law on the prosecution of civil servants.\r\n19.  On 24 June 1994 the Kulp District Governor appointed the Kulp District Gendarme Commander, Ali Ergülmez, as investigating officer. By a report dated 1 April 1995, the District Gendarme Commander submitted that no military operation had been conducted in Akdoruk village on 11 November 1993 and stated that the clashes between the security forces and the PKK had commenced after January 2004 when the village had already been evacuated. He accordingly proposed that the District Administrative Council should issue a decision of non-prosecution.\r\n20.  On 13 July 1995 the Kulp District Administrative Council delivered a decision of non-prosecution on the basis of the investigating officer’s report.\r\nB.  Documents submitted by the parties\r\n21.  The parties submitted various documents to the Court. While delivering its judgment, the Court had particular regard to the following documents:\r\na)\tStatement of the applicant, dated 15 April 1994, made to the Diyarbakır Human Rights Association;\r\nb)\tPetition of the applicant, Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir, dated 17 December 1993, submitted to the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor’s office concerning the burning of their houses by security forces;\r\nc)\tStatements of the applicant, Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir, dated 17 December 1993, taken by the Kulp public prosecutor;\r\nd)\tLetter of Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor’s office to Kulp District Gendarme Commander, dated 28 January 1994, requesting information as to whether or not a military operation had been conducted on 13 November 1993 in the village of Akdoruk;\r\ne)\tStatement of Ahmet Altun, dated 22 February 1994, taken by the gendarme officers;\r\nf)\tStatement of Mustafa Aldemir, dated 3 March 1994, taken by the gendarme officers;\r\ng)\tReport dated 23 June 1994, signed by the mayor of Akdoruk village, Mehmet Yeşil, and two gendarme officers, indicating that it had not been possible to interrogate Abdullah Altun as his address could not be established;\r\nh)\tLetter of Kulp District Gendarme Commander to the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor’s office, dated 24 June 1994, stating that it had not been possible to interrogate Abdullah Altun as his address could not be established;\r\ni)\tNon-jurisdiction decision issued by the Kulp Chief Public Prosecutor’s office, dated 22 August 1994;\r\nj)\tLetter of Kulp District Governor to Kulp District Gendarme Commander, Ali Ergülmez, dated 2 September 1994, appointing him as investigating officer;\r\nk)\tInvestigation and examination report, dated 2 May 1995, signed by Kulp District Gendarme Commander Ali Ergülmez, gendarme officer Kamil Taşçı and village mayor Mehmet Yeşil;\r\nl)\tReport of District Gendarme Commander Ali Ergülmez, dated 1 April 1995, proposing that the District Administrative Council should issue a decision of non-prosecution;\r\nm)\tLetter of District Gendarme Commander Ali Ergülmez, dated 2 July 1995 to Kulp District Governor, submitting the results of the investigation;\r\nn)\tNon-prosecution decision dated 13 July 1995, delivered by the Kulp District Administrative Council;\r\no)\tReport dated 28 August 1995, prepared by Kulp District Gendarme Commander Ali Ergülmez, indicating that no military operation had been conducted in the Akdoruk village on 13 November 1994.

Oral evidence\r\n22.  The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, three Delegates of the Commission took oral evidence in Ankara between 28 June and 2 July 1999 from thirteen witnesses, including the applicant. A further five witnesses had been summoned, but they failed to appear for various reasons. The evidence of those who attended the hearing may be summarised as follows:\r\n1.  Abdullah Altun\r\n23.  Mr Altun stated that he was living in the village of Akdoruk at the time of the events. He explained that on the day of the incident, early in the morning, he had gone to the fields to work. While he was working in the fields, he saw that smoke was rising above the village. From where he was standing, he was able to see that the village was full of soldiers and that it was burning. On his way back to the village, he was stopped by his wife, who told him not to return to the village. She informed him that the soldiers had burned down six houses including theirs and that their house, animals and possessions had been completely destroyed. Mr Altun’s wife further told him that the soldiers had a list of names in their hands and that his name was also included on it.\r\n24.  Mr Altun affirmed that he had stayed at his sister’s house for a few days after the burning of his home and then had gone to Diyarbakır to stay with his daughter.\r\n25.  Concerning his application to the national authorities, he further confirmed that he had gone to the judge at the Kulp Magistrate’s Court with his brother Ahmet Altun and his fellow villager Mustafa Aldemir. They had submitted hand-written petitions to the judge and requested him to conduct a visit to the village of Akdoruk to assess the damage they had suffered. The judge however had refused their request for security reasons. On the same day, the applicant, Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir were further called before the Kulp public prosecutor, who took their statements concerning the burning of their houses. Mr Altun further testified that Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir, who had been called to the Kulp Gendarmerie Station to give further evidence, had been beaten by the gendarmes. He was therefore frightened to go to the gendarmerie station to give a statement.\r\n26.  Mr Altun further stated that the soldiers had gone back to the village of Akdoruk in January 1994 and burned down the remaining houses.\r\n2.  Hediye Altun\r\n27.  The witness, who is the applicant’s wife, was in the village of Akdoruk at the time of the incident. She explained that after her husband had gone to the fields early in the morning, a large number of soldiers arrived in the village on foot. The soldiers had a list in their hands and they read out the names of certain villagers, including the applicant’s. Thereafter, they threw a sort of flammable material towards their house and the stable which caught alight. She tried to save the animals but was stopped by the soldiers. She believed that the soldiers had burned down the houses because the villagers had refused to become village guards. The witness further stated that Ahmet Altun, Mustafa Aldemir and Hüseyin Aldemir had been arrested by the soldiers.\r\n3.  Vesile Yaman\r\n28.  Mrs Yaman, who is the sister of the applicant, was living in the village of Akdoruk at the time of the events. She explained that on the day of the incident, the soldiers had arrived in the village on foot. She saw them throw some chemical substance and burn down the applicant’s house. Her sister-in-law tried to save some of the animals but was stopped by the gendarmes. Her brother was not in the village at the time of the incident. The witness affirmed that the applicant and his wife had stayed at her house after their house was burned down. The witness believed that the soldiers had burned down the village as a punishment, when the villagers refused to become village guards. She explained that her own house was also burned down in January 1994.\r\n4.  Mustafa Aldemir\r\n29.  Mr Aldemir was living in the village of Akdoruk at the time of the events. On the day of the incident, a number of soldiers came to the village on foot. They first went to the applicant’s house and burned it down. Then they burned down six more houses including his house and that of the village mayor, Mehmet Yeşil. The soldiers had a list in their hands and told the villagers that they had instructions to burn down the houses of those on the list. The soldiers subsequently apprehended the witness together with some other villagers. They were all taken to Narlıca village on foot. Mr Aldemir stated before the Delegates that the villagers of Akdoruk had been asked to become village guards about a month prior to the incident. The witness moved to Diyarbakır following the burning of his house. Together with the applicant and another villager, Ahmet Altun, he went to the Kulp Magistrate’s Court judge to complain about the burning of their houses. They further gave statements to the public prosecutor on the same day. Mr Aldemir testified that Ahmet Altun and himself had been summoned to the Kulp Gendarme Statation to give further evidence. He affirmed that he had been beaten by the gendarmes and forced to sign a paper. He therefore disowned the content of the statement dated 3 March 1994.\r\n5.  Mehmet Yeşil\r\n30.  Mr Yeşil was the mayor of Akdoruk village at the time of the incident. On 13 November 1993 early in the morning the witness heard intensive shooting around the village. An armed clash was taking place outside the village. He later learnt that 6 terrorists had died during this clash. Subsequently, a group of soldiers arrived in the village and told him to leave the village for his life was in danger. As a result, leaving his wife and children in the village, the witness left the village on foot with some soldiers and returned to the village three days later. When he returned, he saw that six of the houses, including his house and that of the applicant, had been burned down. The witness further affirmed that he did not see who had burned down the houses but he maintained that the houses were burned because of the clash between the PKK and the security forces. When asked about the investigation and examination report, dated 2 May 1995, the witness admitted that he had signed this report at the Kulp Gendarme Station but stated that no on-site inspection had been conducted in the village.\r\n6.  Süleyman Tutuş\r\n31.  The witness was living in one of the hamlets of Akdoruk village at the time of the event. Early in the morning of the incident, the witness saw a number of soldiers arrive in the village. The soldiers asked the witness to act as their translator. The soldiers had a list of names in their hands and their captain told the witness that they were going to burn down Abdullah Altun’s house. They therefore ordered the witness to tell the applicant’s wife to evacuate the house. The witness saw that soldiers scattered chemicals around the house with a tube, put a match to it and set it alight. They burned down everything, including the animals. In all, the soldiers burned down six houses in the village, including the house of the village mayor, Mehmet Yeşil, who was also in the village during the incident. The soldiers subsequently arrested some of the villagers, including the village mayor and his three daughters. After spending the night in the village, the soldiers left the village on foot the next morning. The witness affirmed that a month before the burning of the houses, the villagers had been called to a meeting in Narlıca by the security forces and had been asked to become village guards.\r\n7.  Abbas Eren\r\n32.  Mr Eren was living in the village of Akdoruk at the time of the events. Early in the morning of the incident, he saw soldiers arriving in the village. He did not hear any gunshots. The witness then saw the soldiers burning down some of the houses in the village, including the house of the applicant and that of the village mayor, Mehmet Yeşil. He recalled that Abdullah was not in the village when his house was burned down but he remembered seeing Abdullah’s wife crying. His own house was not burned down that day. The soldiers subsequently arrested some villagers, including the witness. They were taken to Narlıca village on foot and then to the Kulp Gendarme Station by military vehicles. They were kept in the station for three days and three nights and were given only bread and water. The soldiers came back to the village at the beginning of 1994 and burned down the remaining houses.\r\n8.  Kamil Taşçı\r\n33.  The witness was the gendarme station commander in Kulp District in 1993. He was under the command of Ali Ergülmez. The witness confirmed that he had been involved in the investigation of the complaint concerning the burning of the applicant’s house by the security forces. He had taken statements from two of the complainants but one of the complainants had not shown up for interrogation. He admitted that it had not been possible to conduct an on-site inspection report in the village due to security reasons. The witness stated that there were no records about a military operation or an armed clash in the village of Akdoruk at the time of the incident. He further affirmed that there had been several large scale operations carried out by different military forces in the area and that not all of these operations had been recorded in the log book of the Kulp Gendarme Station. He explained that Akdoruk village had been evacuated by January 1994 and that armed clashes had been quite frequent in the area. When questioned about the possible involvement of security forces in burning down houses, the witness denied this possibility.\r\n9.  Selahattin Aksoy\r\n34.  The witness was the deputy commander of the Kulp Gendarme Station in 1993. His commander was Ali Ergülmez. He stated that he had been involved in the investigation and had taken a statement from Mustafa Aldemir on 3 March 1994. He affirmed that, had a military operation been conducted in the Akdoruk village by the Kulp Gendarmerie, they would definitely have the pre- and post-operation reports. However at that time several military units had been engaged in many military operations and the witness did not know for certain whether another military troop had conducted an operation in the area or not. He admitted that they did not keep records of the operations carried out by other units. Arguing that terrorists, dressed up in military uniforms, had been burning some of the villages, the witness denied any involvement of the military forces in burning down the houses in the area.\r\n10.  Ali Ergülmez\r\n35.  The witness was the commander of Kulp District Gendarmerie in 1993 and Akdoruk village had fallen under his jurisdiction. He stated that when he was appointed as investigating officer by the District Governor to investigate the allegations into the burning of the applicant’s house, he had assigned Mr Tasçı to investigate the matter. He stated that he had signed the report that had been drafted by Mr Taşçı without verifying its content. He further admitted that another military troop could have conducted a military operation in the Akdoruk village without his knowledge. The witness further denied the allegations which suggested that the Kulp gendarmerie forces had been involved in burning villages in the area.\r\n11.  Adil Aslan\r\n36.  The witness was the Kulp public prosecutor in 1993 and had taken the first statements from the applicant, Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir. Mr Aslan stated that he had written down everything that the three complainants had told him and had read out their statements to them before taking their signatures. The witness further admitted that it had not been possible for him to conduct a visit to the Akdoruk village for security reasons. He also recalled that at that time, the prosecutors in the region had lacked investigative powers to investigate the allegations against the security forces.\r\n12.  Selahattin Gündüz\r\n37.  The witness stated that he was living in the Kulp District at the time of the incident. He was in the Akdoruk village a few days before the incident and saw six dead bodies outside the village. He maintained that the villagers were all afraid to live in the area as a result of terrorist attacks. The witness affirmed that he was not in the village when the applicant’s house was burned down.\r\n13.  Salih Afşin\r\n38.  The witness stated that he had moved from Akdoruk village to the Kulp District in 1979. Indicating that he had never lost contact with his fellow villagers from Akdoruk, he stated that he was aware that most of the villagers were afraid to live in the area as a result of the frequent terrorist attacks. The witness affirmed that he was not in the village when the applicant’s house was burned down.\r\nII.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\r\n39.  A full description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Yöyler v. Turkey (no. 26973/95, §§ 37-49, 24 July 2003).\r\nTHE LAW\r\nI.  THE COURT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACTS\r\nA.  Arguments of the parties\r\n1.  The applicant\r\n40.  The applicant alleged that towards the end of 1993, gendarmes had raided his village and that his home and possessions had been destroyed. He requested the Court to find that the destruction of his property and the failure to carry out an effective investigation by the authorities engaged the responsibility of the respondent State under Articles 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and that each of these Articles had been violated.\r\n2.  The Government\r\n41.  The Government submitted that there was no evidence on which to conclude that security forces had burned the applicant’s house. With reference to the statements given by the applicant’s fellow villagers, and to the gendarmerie reports, the Government maintained that the gendarmes had not conducted an operation in the Akdoruk village on 11 November 1993 and that the security forces could therefore not be held responsible for the burning of the applicant’s house.\r\nB.  General Principles\r\n42.  The Court recalls that, in assessing evidence, it adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 264, 18 June 2002). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, the McKerr v. the United Kingdom decision, no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court’s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic authorities and, as a general rule, it is for those authorities to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, § 29). Though the Court is not bound by the latter’s findings, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact they have reached (ibid., p. 18, § 30). In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 161).\r\nC.  The Court’s evaluation of facts\r\n1.  The Court’s assessment of the parties’ submissions and of the evidence\r\n43.  The Court observes that the applicant’s oral testimony (see paragraphs 23-26 above) broadly reiterated the written statements he had given both to the national authorities and the Convention institutions. The applicant’s version of the facts was further supported in important details by the eye-witnesses of the burning of his property. The evidence of the key eye-witnesses, Hediye Altun, Vesile Ayman, Mustafa Aldemir, Süleyman Tutuş and Abbas Eren provided plausible details about how the applicant’s house and belongings were burned down by the soldiers. These witnesses gave detailed information about how the soldiers had arrived in the village and how they had set alight the houses. Three of the witnesses submitted that the soldiers had a list of names in their hands, and had burned down the houses of those people whose names had been indicated in the list.\r\n44.  The Court further observes that the Government witnesses were evasive in their oral testimonies. They all steadfastly refused any suggestion that the security forces would engage in village burning (see paragraphs 33, 34, 35 above). Basing themselves on the absence of any logged reference to a military operation, they all denied that any military operation had been conducted in the village or in its vicinity. The Court is also struck by the testimony of the mayor of Akdoruk village, Mehmet Yeşil, who gave the impression of minimising what he had seen or known (see paragraph 30 above). Although he admitted that a large number of soldiers had arrived in the Akdoruk village early in the morning of the incident and that there had been a clash in the vicinity of the village, he rejected the possibility that the soldiers could have burned down the houses.\r\n45.  The Court therefore concludes that the Government witnesses were not sufficiently persuasive to rebut the direct eye-witness testimonies of the applicant’s witnesses and that there is a strong basis in fact to establish that a military operation was conducted in Akdoruk village on 13 November 1993 and that the applicant’s property and possessions were burned down by the security forces.\r\n2.  The Court’s findings of facts and conclusion\r\n46.  In view of the testimonies of the witnesses heard by the delegates (see paragraphs 22-38 above) and the documentary evidence submitted to it by the parties (see paragraph 21 above), the Court’s conclusion of facts can be summarised as follows.\r\n47.  On 13 November 1993, early in the morning a large number of soldiers arrived in the village of Akdoruk. The soldiers had a list of names in their hands and started to set fire to some of the houses. The applicant was not in the village at the time of the incident. He had gone to the fields to work. From where he was standing, the applicant saw the smoke and flames rising from the village. The applicant’s house, belongings and livestock were destroyed during the incident.\r\n48.  On the basis of these findings, the Court will proceed to examine the applicant’s complaints under the various Articles of the Convention.\r\nII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n49.  The applicant, referring to the circumstances of the destruction of his home and eviction of his family from their village, maintained that there had been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, which reads:\r\n“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”\r\n50.  The Government rejected this complaint as being without any basis.\r\n51.  The Court reiterates that Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the fundamental values of a democratic society. Even in the most difficult of circumstances, such as the fight against organised terrorism and crime, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms treatment contrary to this provision. Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and/or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-II, p. 909, §§ 75-76).\r\n52.  The Court notes that the applicant’s home was burned down before the eyes of members of his family, depriving them of shelter and support and obliging them to leave their home and friends.\r\n53.  The Court considers that the destruction of the applicant’s home and possessions in the above circumstances must have caused him suffering of sufficient severity for the acts of the security forces to be categorised as inhuman treatment within the meaning of Article 3 (see Selçuk and Asker, cited above, p. 910, §§ 77-78).\r\n54.  The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\r\nIII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n55.  The applicant alleged that he was compelled to abandon his home and village in breach of the right to exercise of liberty and enjoyment of security of person.\r\n56.  The Government did not address this aspect of the case.\r\n57.  The Court recalls that the primary concern of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention is protection from an arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The notion of security of person has not been given an independent interpretation (see in this respect Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, nos. 23184/94 and 23185/94, Commission’s report of 28 November 1996, §§ 185-187).\r\n58.  In the present case, the applicant was never arrested or detained, or otherwise deprived of his liberty. The Court notes that the applicant’s insecure personal circumstances arising from the loss of his home does not fall within the notion of security of person as envisaged by Article 5 § 1 of the Convention (see the Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, Commission’s report, cited above, § 186).\r\n59.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.\r\nIV.  ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 8 AND ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\r\n60.  The applicant complained of the deliberate destruction of his home and property. He relied on Article 8 of the Convention, which reads:\r\n“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\r\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”\r\nand Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which provides:\r\n“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\r\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.”\r\n61.  The Government denied the factual basis of the applicant’s complaints and averred that his allegations were unsubstantiated.\r\n62.  The Court has found it established that the security forces deliberately destroyed the applicant’s house and property, obliging his family to leave their village (see paragraph 47 above). There is no doubt that these acts, in addition to giving rise to a violation of Article 3, constituted a grave and unjustified interference with the applicant’s rights to respect for his private and family life and home, and to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions (see Menteş and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 28 November 1997, Reports 1997-VIII, p. 2711, § 73, and Dulaş v. Turkey, no. 25801/94, § 60, 30 January 2001).\r\n63.  The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\r\nV.  ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 6 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION\r\nA.  Article 6 § 1 of the Convention\r\n64.  The applicant submitted that his right to access to court to assert his civil rights had been denied on account of the failure of the authorities to conduct an effective investigation into his allegations. In his opinion, without such an investigation he had no chance of succeeding in obtaining compensation in civil proceedings.\r\n65.  The Government maintained that the applicant had failed to pursue the remedies available in domestic law. Had the applicant filed a civil action, he would have enjoyed effective access to a court.\r\n66.  The Court notes that the applicant did not bring an action before the civil courts for the reasons given in the admissibility decision of 11 September 1995. It is therefore impossible to determine whether the national courts would have been able to adjudicate on the applicant’s claims had he initiated proceedings. In the Court’s view, however, the applicant’s complaints mainly pertain to the lack of an effective investigation into the deliberate destruction of his family home and possessions by the security forces. It will therefore examine this complaint from the standpoint of Article 13, which imposes a more general obligation on States to provide an effective remedy in respect of alleged violations of the Convention (see Selçuk and Asker, cited above, p. 912, § 92).\r\n67.  The Court therefore finds it unnecessary to determine whether there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\r\nB.  Article 13 of the Convention\r\n68.  The applicant submitted that he had no effective remedy available in respect of his Convention grievances. With reference to previous cases concerning the destruction of villages, the applicant asserted that there was an administrative practice of violating Article 13 of the Convention in south-east Turkey and that he was a victim of that practice.\r\n69.  The Government argued that the applicant had deliberately ceased to pursue remedies in domestic law. In this connection, they pointed out that after filing a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor’s office in Kulp, the applicant had disappeared without leaving any address with the judicial authorities. Despite this omission, the judicial authorities had carried out an effective investigation into the applicant’s allegations by taking statements from his fellow villagers.\r\n70.  The Court reiterates that Article 13 of the Convention guarantees the availability at national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of an “arguable complaint” under the Convention and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant’s complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (see Dulaş, cited above, § 65 and Yöyler, cited above, 87).\r\n71.  Where an individual has an arguable claim that his or her home and possessions have been purposely destroyed by agents of the State, Article 13 requires, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible and including effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (see Menteş and Others, cited above, pp. 2715-16, § 89).\r\n72.  The Court reiterates that it has already found that the applicant’s home and possessions were destroyed in violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The applicant’s complaints in this regard are therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52, and Dulaş, cited above, § 67).\r\n73.  The Court observes that following the burning of their houses and belongings, the applicant, Ahmet Altun and Mustafa Aldemir lodged a complaint with the Kulp public prosecutor. In their statements, the applicant and his two fellow villagers clearly indicated that their houses had been burned down by security forces. Upon receipt of these complaints, the Kulp public prosecutor initiated a preliminary investigation into the applicant’s claims. Given the seriousness of the allegations, the Court is of the opinion that the public prosecutor was under an obligation to gather and record evidence which would help to shed light on the facts of the incident. However, it is noted that the public prosecutor’s investigation was limited to taking statements from the three complainants. It does not appear that any attempt was made to carry out an on-site inspection at the scene of the incident, to establish the true version of the facts through questioning other villagers who might have witnessed the events or to interview the members of security forces who were allegedly involved in the incident. It therefore considers that these elements disclose considerable defects in the reliability and thoroughness of this part of the investigation.\r\n74.  According to the case-file before the Court, after taking statements from the three complainants, the Kulp public prosecutor declared that he had no jurisdiction and transferred the file to the Kulp Administrative Council pursuant to the Law on the prosecution of civil servants. In respect of this second part of the domestic investigation, the Court considers that the authorities who were responsible for the investigation lacked the requisite independence and impartiality. In this context, it is recalled that the Kulp District Governor appointed the Kulp District Gendarme Commander, who was the hierarchical superior of the gendarmes who were allegedly involved in the incident, as investigating officer. It is also clear from the witness testimonies that the Kulp District Gendarme Commander further delegated the Kulp Gendarme Station Commander to conduct the investigation. In view of the fact that the Kulp Gendarmerie was allegedly accused of being involved in the burning of the applicant’s house, the Court finds it unacceptable that the same gendarme station was delegated to conduct an investigation into the allegations.\r\n75.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the authorities failed to conduct a thorough and effective investigation into the applicant’s allegations and that access to any other available remedy, including a claim for compensation, has thus also been denied him.\r\n76.  There has therefore been a breach of Article 13 of the Convention.\r\nVI.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES 3, 6, 8 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION AND ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1\r\n77.  The applicant maintained that, because of his Kurdish origin, he had been subjected to discrimination in breach of Article 14 of the Convention, in conjunction with Articles 3, 6, 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Article 14 provides:\r\n“The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.”\r\n78.  The applicant argued that the destruction of his family home and possessions was the result of an official policy, which constituted discrimination because of his status as a member of a national minority.\r\n79.  The Court has examined the applicant’s allegation in the light of the evidence submitted to it, but considers it unsubstantiated. There has therefore been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention.\r\nVII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 18 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n80.  The applicant alleged that the interference or restrictions complained of have been imposed for purposes incompatible with the Convention. He invoked Article 18 of the Convention, which reads:\r\n“The restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.”\r\n81.  The Court points out that it has examined this allegation in the light of the evidence submitted to it, and found that it was unsubstantiated. Accordingly, no violation of this provision has been established.\r\nVIII.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n82.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:\r\n“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”\r\nA.  Pecuniary Damage\r\n83.  The applicant claimed a total amount of 87,078.82 pounds sterling (GBP) for pecuniary damage in respect of the loss of his house, livestock, household goods, foodstuffs and income.\r\n84.  The Government argued that the applicant’s allegations that his home and possessions had been destroyed by security forces had not been substantiated and that, therefore, there was no requirement to award any compensation.\r\n85.  In view of its finding that the applicant’s home and possessions were destroyed by the security forces (see paragraph 47 above), the Court considers that it is necessary to award compensation for pecuniary damage. However, as the applicant has not supported his claims as to the quantity and value of his lost property with any documentary or other evidence, the Court will make its assessment of the amounts on an equitable basis.\r\n1.  House\r\n86.  The applicant claimed damages in respect of a house covering 240 square metres, which he valued at GBP 15,664.70.\r\n87.  In the absence of any decisive evidence and making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the amount of 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of the destroyed building.\r\n2.  Other property\r\n88.  The applicant submitted claims in respect of the loss of household goods, such as furniture, carpets and kitchen utensils and in respect of his livestock. Under this head he claimed GBP 4,732.90.\r\n89.  In view of the absence of any independent and conclusive evidence as to the applicant’s claims for property and on the basis of equity, the Court awards him EUR 6,000.\r\n3.  Loss of income\r\n90.  The applicant also claimed compensation for loss of income from farming. In this respect, he submitted that he had made his living from his land. As a direct consequence of being forced to leave the Akdoruk village, he was no longer able to look after their land and was therefore deprived of the income it had generated. His claims under this head totalled GBP 66,681.21.\r\n91.  The Court is satisfied that the applicant must have suffered a loss of income as a result of being forced from his home and village. In the absence of independent evidence of the applicant’s income from his landholdings, and having regard to equitable considerations, the Court awards him EUR 6,000 under this head.\r\n4.  Summary\r\n92.  Consequently, in respect of pecuniary damage the Court awards the applicant a total sum of EUR 22,000 to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of settlement.\r\nB.  Non-pecuniary damage\r\n93.  The applicant claimed GBP 15,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. He referred in this regard to the pain he had suffered on account of the destruction of his property.\r\n94.  The Government, disputing that any violations had occurred, submitted that no award for non-pecuniary damage should be awarded to the applicant. The Government further contended that, in the event that the Court found a violation, this would be sufficient to compensate for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant.\r\n95.  The Court considers that an award should be made in respect of non-pecuniary damage bearing in mind the seriousness of the violations which it has found in respect of Articles 3, 8 and 13 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 due to the deliberate destruction of the applicant’s home and property and his subsequent relocation from Akdoruk village.\r\n96.  It accordingly awards the applicant EUR 14,500 for non-pecuniary damage, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment.\r\nC.  Costs and expenses\r\n97.  Finally, submitting a schedule of costs, the applicant claimed a total sum of GBP 15,523.21 for costs and expenses. These claims comprised:\r\n(a)\tGBP 8,835 for fees of United Kingdom-based lawyers;\r\n(b)\tGBP 1,158.44 for administrative costs incurred by the United Kingdom-based lawyers;\r\n(c)\tGBP 655 for administrative costs incurred by the Kurdish Human Rights Project (“KHRP”);\r\n(d)\tGBP 2,000 for translations carried out by the KHRP;\r\n(e)\tGBP 2,874.77 for costs incurred by lawyers during the Commission’s fact-finding mission in Ankara.\r\n98.  The Government considered these claims exorbitant and unsubstantiated. They disputed that any sum should be awarded in respect of the role of the KHRP, which organisation could be categorised neither as an applicant nor as a representative.\r\n99.  The Court notes that the present case involved complex issues of fact and law requiring detailed examination, including the taking of evidence from witnesses in Ankara. It reiterates in this connection that only legal costs and expenses necessarily and actually incurred can be reimbursed under Article 41 of the Convention.\r\n100.  Making its own estimate based on the information available, the Court awards the applicant in respect of costs and expenses EUR 15,000 exclusive of any value-added tax that may be chargeable such sum to be converted into pounds sterling and paid into the applicant’s representative’s bank account in the United Kingdom as set out in his just satisfaction claim.\r\nD.  Default interest\r\n101.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n2.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 5 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n3.  Holds that it is unnecessary to determine whether there has been a breach of Article 6 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n4.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n5.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n6.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n7.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 18 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n8.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention;\r\n\r\n9.  Holds\r\n(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts free of any tax that may be chargeable:\r\n(i)  EUR 22,000 (twenty-two thousand euros) in respect of pecuniary damage to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment and to be paid into the applicant’s bank account in Turkey;\r\n(ii)  EUR 14,500 (fourteen thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment and to be paid into the applicant’s bank account in Turkey;\r\n(iii)  EUR 15,000 (fifteen thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses such sum to be converted into pounds sterling and to be paid into the bank account in the United Kingdom indicated by the applicant;\r\n(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\r\n\r\n10.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.\r\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 1 June 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\r\n\tMichael O’BOYLE\tViera STRÁŽNICKÁ\r\n\tRegistrar\tPresident\r\n",

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 20190/92)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n22 November 1995 \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the case of C.R. v. the United Kingdom  ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A  , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tF. GÖLCÜKLÜ,\r\n\tMr \tC. RUSSO,\r\n\tMr \tJ. DE MEYER,\r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS,\r\n\tMr \tF. BIGI,\r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND, \r\n\tMr \tP. JAMBREK, \r\n\tMr \tU. LOHMUS,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 24 June and 27 October 1995,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE \r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 9 September 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 20190/92) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr C.R., a British citizen, on 31 March 1992.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention. \r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30). \r\n3.   On 24 September 1994 the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider both the instant case and the case of S.W. v. the United Kingdom  .  \r\n4.   The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On 24 September 1994, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr C. Russo, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr F. Bigi and Mr U. Lohmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).  Subsequently, Mr P. Jambrek, substitute judge, replaced Mr Macdonald, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1). \r\n5.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).  Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 5 April 1995 and the Government’s memorial on 6 April.  On 17 May 1995 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to reply in writing. \r\n6.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 June 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court: \r\n(a) for the Government\r\n\t\tMs S. DICKSON, Foreign and Commonwealth Office,\tAgent,\r\n\t\tMr A. MOSES, QC,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr R. HEATON, Home Office,\r\n\t\tMr J. TOON, Home Office,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr J. MUCHA,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\n\t\tMr R. HILL, Barrister-at-law,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr A.C. GUTHRIE,\tAssistant.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Mucha, Mr Hill and Mr Moses and also replies to questions put by some of its members individually. \r\nAS TO THE FACTS \r\nI.   PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE \r\n7.   The applicant is a British citizen, born in 1952, and lives in Leicester. \r\n8.   The applicant married his wife on 11 August 1984.  They had one son, who was born in 1985.  On 11 November 1987 the couple were separated for a period of about two weeks before becoming reconciled. \r\n9.   On 21 October 1989, as a result of further matrimonial difficulties, his wife left the matrimonial home with their son and returned to live with her parents.  She had by this time already consulted solicitors regarding her matrimonial affairs and had left a letter for the applicant in which she informed him that she intended to petition for divorce.  However no legal proceedings had been taken by her before the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to criminal proceedings.  The applicant had on 23 October 1989 spoken to his wife by telephone indicating that it was his intention also to \"see about a divorce\". \r\n10.   Shortly before 9 p.m. on 12 November 1989, twenty-two days after his wife had returned to live with her parents, and while the parents were out, the applicant forced his way into the parents’ house and attempted to have sexual intercourse with the wife against her will. In the course of that attempt he assaulted her, in particular by squeezing her neck with both hands. \r\n11.   The applicant was charged with attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  At his trial before the Leicester Crown Court on 30 July 1990 it was submitted that the charge of rape was one which was not known to the law by reason of the fact that the applicant was the husband of the alleged victim.  He relied on a statement by Sir Matthew Hale CJ in his History of the Pleas of the Crown published in 1736: \r\n\"But the husband cannot be guilty of rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.\" \r\n12.   In his judgment ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 747) Mr Justice Owen noted that it was a statement made in general terms at a time when marriage was indissoluble.  Hale CJ had been expounding the common law as it seemed to him at that particular time and was doing it in a book and not with reference to a particular set of circumstances presented to him in a prosecution.  The bald statement had been reproduced in the first edition of Archbold on Criminal Pleadings, Evidence and Practice (1822, p. 259) in the following terms: \"A husband also cannot be guilty of rape upon his wife.\"\r\nMr Justice Owen further examined a series of court decisions (R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen’s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 113; R. v. Clarke [1949] 2 All England Law Reports 448; R. v. Miller [1954] 2 All England Law Reports 529; R. v. Reid [1972] 2 All England Law Reports 1350; R. v. O’Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663; R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22; R. v. Roberts [1986] Criminal Law Reports 188; see paragraphs 19-22 below), recognising that a wife’s consent to marital intercourse was impliedly given by her at the time of marriage and that the consent could be revoked on certain conditions.  He added: \r\n\"I am asked to accept that there is a presumption or an implied consent by the wife to sexual intercourse with her husband; with that, I do not find it difficult to agree.  However, I find it hard to ... believe that it ever was the common law that a husband was in effect entitled to beat his wife into submission to sexual intercourse ...  If it was, it is a very sad commentary on the law and a very sad commentary upon the judges in whose breasts the law is said to reside.  However, I will nevertheless accept that there is such an implicit consent as to sexual intercourse which requires my consideration as to whether this accused may be convicted for rape.\" \r\nOn the question of what circumstances would suffice in law to revoke the consent, Mr Justice Owen noted that it may be brought to an end, firstly, by a court order or equivalent.  Secondly, he observed, it was apparent from the Court of Appeal’s judgment in the case of R. v. Steele ([1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22) that the implied consent could be withdrawn by agreement between the parties.  Such an agreement could clearly be implicit; there was nothing in the case-law to suggest the contrary.  Thirdly, he was of the view that the common law recognised that a withdrawal of either party from cohabitation, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse has been terminated, would amount to a revocation of the implicit consent.  He concluded that both the second and third exceptions to the matrimonial immunity against prosecution for rape applied in the case.\r\nFollowing the judge’s ruling, the applicant pleaded guilty to attempted rape and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. \r\n13.   The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, on the ground that Mr Justice Owen had made a wrong decision in law in ruling that a man may rape his wife when the consent to intercourse which his wife gave on entering marriage had been revoked neither by a court order nor by agreement between the parties. \r\n14.   On 14 March 1991 the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division (Lord Lane CJ, Sir Stephen Brown P, Watkins, Neill and Russell LJJ), unanimously dismissed the appeal ([1991] 2 All England Law Reports 257).  Lord Lane noted that the general proposition of Sir Matthew Hale in his History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736) (see paragraph 11 above) that a man could not commit rape upon his wife was generally accepted as a correct statement of the common law at that epoch.  Further, Lord Lane made an analysis of previous court decisions, from which it appears that in R. v. Clarence (1888), the first reported case of this nature, some judges of the Court for Crown Cases Reserved had objected to the principle.  In the next reported case, R. v. Clarke (1949), the trial court had departed from the principle by holding that the husband’s immunity was lost in the event of a court order directing that the wife was no longer bound to cohabit with him.  Almost every court decision thereafter had made increasingly important exceptions to the marital immunity (see paragraph 22 below). The Court of Appeal had accepted in R. v. Steele (1976) that the implied consent to intercourse could be terminated by agreement.  This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Roberts (1986), where it held that the lack of a non-molestation clause in a deed of separation, concluded on expiry of a non-molestation order, did not revive the consent to intercourse. \r\nLord Lane added the following observations: \r\n\"Ever since the decision of Byrne J in R. v. Clarke in 1949, courts have been paying lip-service to Hale CJ’s proposition, whilst at the same time increasing the number of exceptions, the number of situations to which it does not apply.  This is a legitimate use of the flexibility of the common law which can and should adapt itself to changing social attitudes. \r\nThere comes a time when the changes are so great that it is no longer enough to create further exceptions restricting the effect of the proposition, a time when the proposition itself requires examination to see whether its terms are in accord with what is generally regarded today as acceptable behaviour. \r\n... \r\nIt seems to us that where the common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is the true position of a wife in present-day society, the duty of the court is to take steps to alter the rule if it can legitimately do so in the light of any relevant parliamentary enactment.  That in the end comes down to a consideration of the word ‘unlawful’ in the 1976 Act.\" \r\nLord Lane then critically examined the different strands of interpretation of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act in the case-law, including the argument that the term \"unlawful\" (see paragraph 17 below) excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.  He concluded: \r\n\"...  [W]e do not consider that we are inhibited by the 1976 Act from declaring that the husband’s immunity as expounded by Hale CJ no longer exists.  We take the view that the time has now arrived when the law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim.\" \r\n15.   The Court of Appeal granted the applicant leave to appeal to the House of Lords, which unanimously upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment on 23 October 1991 ([1991] 4 All England Law Reports 481). Lord Keith of Kinkel, joined by Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, Lord Griffiths, Lord Ackner and Lord Lowry, gave, inter alia, the following reasons: \r\n\"For over 150 years after the publication of Hale’s work there appeared to have been no reported case in which judicial consideration was given to his proposition.  The first such case was R. v. Clarence [1888] 22 Queen’s Bench Division 23, [1886-90] All England Law Reports 133 ...  It may be taken that the proposition was generally regarded as an accurate statement of the common law of England.  The common law is, however, capable of evolving in the light of changing social, economic and cultural developments.  Hale’s proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects at the time it was enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are very familiar and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail.  Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife was the subservient chattel of the husband.  Hale’s proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time.  In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable. \r\n... \r\nThe position then is that that part of Hale’s proposition which asserts that a wife cannot retract the consent to sexual intercourse which she gives on marriage has been departed from in a series of decided cases.  On grounds of principle there is no good reason why the whole proposition should not be held inapplicable in modern times.  The only question is whether section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presents an insuperable obstacle to that sensible course.  The argument is that ‘unlawful’ in that subsection means outside the bond of marriage. \r\n...  The fact is that it is clearly unlawful to have sexual intercourse with any woman without her consent, and that the use of the word in the subsection adds nothing.  In my opinion there are no rational grounds for putting the suggested gloss on the word, and it should be treated as being mere surplusage in this enactment ... \r\nI am therefore of the opinion that section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act presents no obstacle to this House declaring that in modern times the supposed marital exception in rape forms no part of the law of England.  The Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, took a similar view [in the present case].  Towards the end of the judgment of that court Lord Lane CJ said ...:\r\n‘The remaining and no less difficult question is whether, despite that view, this is an area where the court should      step aside to leave the matter to the parliamentary process.  This is not the creation of a new offence, it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive and we consider that it is our duty having reached that conclusion to act upon it.’ \r\nI respectfully agree.\" \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE \r\nA. The offence of rape \r\n16.   The offence of rape, at common law, was traditionally defined as unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent by force, fear or fraud.  By section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, \"it is a felony for a man to rape a woman\". \r\n17.   Section 1 (1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides, in so far as it is material, as follows: \r\n\"For the purposes of section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (which relates to rape) a man commits rape if  -\r\n(a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it ...\" \r\n18.   On 3 November 1994 the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 replaced the above provisions by inserting new subsections to section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, one of the effects of which was to remove the word \"unlawful\": \r\n\"1.  (1)   It is an offence for a man to rape a woman or another man.\r\n\t(2)   A man commits rape if – (a) he has sexual intercourse with a person ... who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it ...\" \r\nB. Marital immunity \r\n19.   Until the proceedings in the applicant’s case the English courts, on the few occasions when they were confronted with the issue whether directly or indirectly, had always recognised at least some form of immunity attaching to a husband from any charge of rape or attempted rape by reason of a notional or fictional consent to intercourse deemed to have been given by the wife on marriage.  The proposition of Sir Matthew Hale quoted above (see paragraph 11) has been upheld until recently, for example in the case of R. v. Kowalski ([1987] 86 Criminal Appeal Reports 339), which concerned the question whether or not a wife had impliedly consented to acts which if performed against her consent would amount to an indecent assault.  Mr Justice Ian Kennedy, giving the judgment of the court, stated, obiter: \r\n\"It is clear, well-settled and ancient law that a man cannot, as actor, be guilty of rape upon his wife.\" \r\nAnd he went on to say that that principle was \r\n\"dependent upon the implied consent to sexual intercourse which arises from the married state and which continues until that consent is put aside by decree nisi, by a separation order or, in certain circumstances, by a separation agreement\". \r\nIn another example, Lord Justice O’Connor in the R. v. Roberts case ([1986] Criminal Law Reports 188) held: \r\n\"The status of marriage involves that the woman has given her consent to her husband having intercourse with her during the subsistence of the marriage ... she cannot unilaterally withdraw it.\" \r\n20.   However, on 5 November 1990, Mr Justice Simon Brown held in R. v. C. ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 755) that the whole concept of marital exemption in rape was misconceived: \r\n\"Were it not for the deeply unsatisfactory consequence of reaching any other conclusion on the point, I would shrink, if sadly, from adopting this radical view of the true position in law.  But adopt it I do.  Logically, I regard it as the only defensible stance, certainly now as the law has developed and arrived in the late twentieth century.  In my judgment, the position in law today is, as already declared in Scotland, that there is no marital exemption to the law of rape.  That is the ruling I give.\" \r\nOn the other hand, on 20 November 1990, in R. v. J. ([1991] 1 All England Law Reports 759) Mr Justice Rougier upheld the general common law rule, considering that the effect of section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act was that the marital exemption embodied in Hale’s proposition was preserved, subject to those exceptions established by cases decided before the Act was passed.  He further stated:\r\n\"... there is an important general principle to be considered here, and that is that the law, especially the criminal law, should be clear so that a man may know where he stands in relation to it.  I am not being so fanciful as to suppose that this defendant carefully considered the authorities and took Counsel’s advice before behaving as alleged, but the basic principle extends a long way beyond the bounds of this case and should operate to prevent a man being convicted by means of decisions of the law ex post facto.\" \r\nOn 15 January 1991, Mr Justice Swinton Thomas in R. v. S. followed Rougier J, though he considered that it was open to judges to define further exceptions.\r\nBoth Rougier and Swinton Thomas JJ stated that they regretted that section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act precluded them from taking the same line as Simon Brown J in R. v. C. \r\n21.   In its Working Paper 116 \"Rape within Marriage\" completed on 17 September 1990, the Law Commission stated: \r\n\"2.8 It is generally accepted that, subject to exceptions (considered ... below), a husband cannot be convicted of raping his wife ...  Indeed there seems to be no recorded prosecution before 1949 of a husband for raping his wife ... \r\n... \r\n2.11 The immunity has given rise to a substantial body of law about the particular cases in which the exemption does not apply. The limits of this law are difficult to state with certainty. Much of it rests on first instance decisions which have never been comprehensively reviewed at appellate level ...\" \r\n22.   The Law Commission identified the following exceptions to a husband’s immunity:\r\n - where a court order has been made, in particular: \r\n(a)  where an order of the court has been made which provides that a wife should no longer be bound to cohabit with her husband (R. v. Clarke [1949] 33 Criminal Appeal Reports 216); \r\n(b)  where there has been a decree of judicial separation or a decree nisi of divorce on the ground that \"between the pronouncement of decree nisi and the obtaining of a decree absolute a marriage subsists as a mere technicality\" (R. v. O’Brien [1974] 3 All England Law Reports 663); \r\n(c)  where a court has issued an injunction restraining the husband from molesting the wife or the husband has given an undertaking to the court that he will not molest her (R. v. Steele [1976] 65 Criminal Appeal Reports 22); \r\n(d)  in the case of R. v. Roberts ([1986] Criminal Law Reports 188), the Court of Appeal found that where a non-molestation order of two months had been made in favour of the wife her deemed consent to intercourse did not revive on expiry of the order;\r\n - where no court order has been made: \r\n(e)  Mr Justice Lynskey observed, obiter, in R. v. Miller ([1954] 2 Queen’s Bench Division 282) that a wife’s consent would be revoked by an agreement to separate, particularly if it contained a non-molestation clause; \r\n(f)  Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane stated, obiter, in R. v. Steele that a separation agreement with a non-cohabitation clause would have that effect. \r\n23.   The Law Commission noted that it was stated in R. v. Miller and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Steele that lodging a petition for divorce would not be sufficient.\r\nIt referred also to the ruling by Mr Justice Owen in the present case where an implied agreement to separate was considered sufficient to revoke the immunity and that, even in the absence of agreement, the withdrawal from cohabitation by either party, accompanied by a clear indication that consent to sexual intercourse had been terminated, would operate to exclude the immunity.  It found this view difficult to reconcile with the approach in Steele that filing a divorce petition was \"clearly\" not sufficient.  The ruling in the present case appeared substantially to extend what had previously been thought to be the law, although it emphasised that factual separation, and not mere revocation of consent to intercourse, was necessary to remove the immunity. \r\n24.   The Law Commission pointed out that its inquiry was unusual in one important respect.  It was usual practice, when considering the reform of common law rules, to consider the grounds expressed in the cases or other authorities for the current state of the law, in order to analyse whether those grounds were well-founded.  However, that step was of little assistance here, partly because there was little case-law on the subject but principally because there was little dispute that the reason set out in the authorities for the state of the law could not be supported (paragraph 4.1 of the Working Paper).  The basis of the law was that intercourse against the wife’s actual will was excluded from the law of rape by the fictional deemed consent to intercourse perceived by Sir Matthew Hale in his dictum.  This notion was not only quite artificial but, certainly in the modern context, was also quite anomalous.  Indeed, it was difficult to find any current authority or commentator who thought that it was even remotely supportable.  The artificial and anomalous nature of the marital immunity could be seen if it was reviewed against the current law on the legal effects of marriage (paragraph 4.2).\r\nThe concept of deemed consent was artificial because the legal consequences of marriage were not the result of the parties’ mutual agreement.  Although the parties should have legal capacity to enter into the marriage contract and should observe the necessary formalities, they were not free to decide the terms of the contract; marriage was rather a status from which flow certain rights or obligations, the contents of which were determined by the law from time to time.  This point had been emphasised by Mr Justice Hawkins in R. v. Clarence (1888) when he said: \"The intercourse which takes place between husband and wife after marriage is not by virtue of any special consent on her part, but is mere submission to an obligation imposed on her by law\" (paragraph 4.3).\r\nIn this connection, the Law Commission stressed that \"[t]he rights and duties arising from marriage have, however, changed over the years as the law has adapted to changing social conditions and values. The more modern view of marriage is that it is a partnership of equals\" (paragraph 4.4).  It then gave examples of such changes in the law and added: \r\n\"4.11 This gradual recognition of mutual rights and obligations within marriage, described in paragraphs 4.3-4.10 above, in our view demonstrates clearly that, whatever other arguments there may be in favour of the immunity, it cannot be claimed to be in any way justified by the nature of, or by the law governing, modern marriage.\" \r\n25.   The Law Commission made, inter alia, the provisional proposal that \"the present marital immunity be abolished in all cases\" (paragraph 5.2 of the Working Paper). \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION \r\n26.   In his application of 31 March 1992 (no. 20190/92) to the Commission, the applicant complained that, in breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, he was convicted in respect of conduct, namely the attempted rape upon his wife, which at the relevant time did not, so he submitted, constitute a criminal offence. \r\n27.   The Commission declared the application admissible on 14 January 1994.  In its report of 27 June 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention (fourteen votes to three).  The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment  .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT \r\n28.   At the hearing on 20 June 1995 the Government, as they had done in their memorial, invited the Court to hold that there had been no violation of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention. \r\n29.   On the same occasion the applicant reiterated the request to the Court stated in his memorial to find that there had been a breach of Article 7 (art. 7) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention. \r\nAS TO THE LAW \r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 7 (art. 7) OF THE CONVENTION \r\n30.   The applicant complained that his conviction and sentence for attempted rape of his wife constituted retrospective punishment in breach of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, which reads: \r\n\"1.  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed.  Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed. \r\n2.   This Article (art. 7) shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.\" \r\n31.   The Government and the Commission disagreed with the above contention. \r\nA. General principles \r\n32.   The guarantee enshrined in Article 7 (art. 7), which is an essential element of the rule of law, occupies a prominent place in the Convention system of protection, as is underlined by the fact that no derogation from it is permissible under Article 15 (art. 15) in time of war or other public emergency.  It should be construed and applied, as follows from its object and purpose, in such a way as to provide effective safeguards against arbitrary prosecution, conviction and punishment. \r\n33.   Accordingly, as the Court held in its Kokkinakis v. Greece judgment of 25 May 1993 (Series A no. 260-A, p. 22, para. 52), Article 7 (art. 7) is not confined to prohibiting the retrospective application of the criminal law to an accused’s disadvantage: it also embodies, more generally, the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty (nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege) and the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused’s detriment, for instance by analogy.  From these principles it follows that an offence must be clearly defined in the law.  In its aforementioned judgment the Court added that this requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts’ interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable.  The Court thus indicated that when speaking of \"law\" Article 7 (art. 7) alludes to the very same concept as that to which the Convention refers elsewhere when using that term, a concept which comprises written as well as unwritten law and implies qualitative requirements, notably those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, as a recent authority, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37). \r\n34.   However clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation.  There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Indeed, in the United Kingdom, as in the other Convention States, the progressive development of the criminal law through judicial law-making is a well entrenched and necessary part of legal tradition. Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen. \r\nB. Application of the foregoing principles \r\n35.   The applicant maintained that the general common law principle that a husband could not be found guilty of rape upon his wife, albeit subject to certain limitations, was still effective on 12 November 1989, when he committed the acts which gave rise to the charge of attempted rape paragraph 10 above).  A succession of court decisions before and also after that date, for instance on 20 November 1990 in R. v. J. (see paragraph 20 above), had affirmed the general principle of immunity.  It was clearly beyond doubt that as at 12 November 1989 no change in the law had been effected, although one was being mooted.  The removal of the immunity by the Court of Appeal on 14 March 1991 and the House of Lords on 23 October 1991 occurred by way of direct reversal, not clarification, of the law.\r\nWhen the House of Commons debated the Bill for the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see paragraph 17 above), different views on the marital immunity were expressed.  On the advice of the Minister of State to await a report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, an amendment that would have abolished the immunity was withdrawn and never voted upon.  In its report, which was not presented until 1984, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that the immunity should be maintained and that a new exception should be created.\r\nIn 1988, when considering certain amendments to the 1976 Act, Parliament had the opportunity to take out the word \"unlawful\" in section 1 (1) (a) (see paragraph 17 above) or to introduce a new provision on marital intercourse, but took no action in this respect.\r\nOn 17 September 1990 the Law Commission provisionally recommended that the immunity rule be abolished (see paragraphs 24 and 25 above). However, the debate was pre-empted by the Court of Appeal’s and the House of Lords’ rulings in the applicant’s case (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above).  In the applicant’s submission, these rulings altered the law retrospectively, which would not have been the case had the Law Commission’s proposal been implemented by Parliament.  Consequently, he concluded, when Parliament in 1994 removed the word \"unlawful\" from section 1 of the 1976 Act (see paragraph 18 above), it did not merely restate the law as it had been in 1976. \r\n36.   The applicant further argued that in examining his complaint under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention, the Court should not consider his conduct in relation to any of the exceptions to the immunity rule.  The issue was never resolved by the national courts, as the sole ground on which the applicant’s conviction rested was in fact the removal of the common law fiction by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. \r\n37.   Should a foreseeability test akin to that under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) apply in the instant case, the applicant was of the opinion that it had not been satisfied.  Although the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords did not create a new offence or change the basic ingredients of the offence of rape, they were extending an existing offence to include conduct which until then was excluded by the common law.  They could not be said to have adapted the law to a new kind of conduct but rather to a change of social attitudes.  To extend the criminal law, solely on such a basis, to conduct which was previously lawful was precisely what Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention was designed to prevent.  Moreover, the applicant stressed, it was impossible to specify with precision when the change in question had occurred.  In November 1989, change by judicial interpretation was not foreseen by the Law Commission, which considered that a parliamentary enactment would be necessary. \r\n38.   The Government and the Commission were of the view that by November 1989 there was significant doubt as to the validity of the alleged marital immunity for rape.  This was an area where the law had been subject to progressive development and there were strong indications that still wider interpretation by the courts of the inroads on the immunity was probable.  In particular, given the recognition of women’s equality of status with men in marriage and outside it and of their autonomy over their own bodies, the adaptation of the ingredients of the offence of rape was reasonably foreseeable, with appropriate legal advice, to the applicant.  He was not convicted of conduct which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when it was committed.\r\nIn addition, the Government pointed out, on the basis of agreed facts Mr Justice Owen had found that there was an implied agreement between the applicant and his wife to separation and to withdrawal of the consent to intercourse.  The circumstances in his case were thus covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already stated by the English courts. \r\n39.   The Court notes that the applicant’s conviction for attempted rape was based on the statutory offence of rape in section 1 of the 1956 Act, as further defined in section 1 (1) of the 1976 Act (see paragraphs 16 and 17 above).  The applicant does not dispute that the conduct for which he was convicted would have constituted attempted rape within the meaning of the statutory definition of rape as applicable at the time, had the victim not been his wife.  His complaint under Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention relates solely to the fact that he could not avail himself of the marital immunity under common law because, so he submitted, it had been retrospectively abolished. \r\n40.   It is to be observed that a crucial issue in the judgment of the Court of Appeal (summarised at paragraph 14 above) related to the definition of rape in section 1 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act: \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it\".  The question was whether \"removal\" of the marital immunity would conflict with the statutory definition of rape, in particular whether it would be prevented by the word \"unlawful\".  The Court of Appeal carefully examined various strands of interpretation of the provision in the case-law, including the argument that the term \"unlawful\" excluded intercourse within marriage from the definition of rape.  In this connection, the Court recalls that it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply national law (see, for instance, the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, pp. 86-87, para. 37).  It sees no reason to disagree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion, which was subsequently upheld by the House of Lords (see paragraph 15 above), that the word \"unlawful\" in the definition of rape was merely surplusage and did not inhibit them from \"removing a common law fiction which had become anachronistic and offensive\" and from declaring that \"a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim\" (see paragraph 14 above). \r\n41.   The decisions of the Court of Appeal and then the House of Lords did no more than continue a perceptible line of case-law development dismantling the immunity of a husband from prosecution for rape upon his wife (for a description of this development, see paragraphs 14 and 20-25 above).  There was no doubt under the law as it stood on 12 November 1989 that a husband who forcibly had sexual intercourse with his wife could, in various circumstances, be found guilty of rape. Moreover, there was an evident evolution, which was consistent with the very essence of the offence, of the criminal law through judicial interpretation towards treating such conduct generally as within the scope of the offence of rape.  This evolution had reached a stage where judicial recognition of the absence of immunity had become a reasonably foreseeable development of the law (see paragraph 34 above). \r\n42.   The essentially debasing character of rape is so manifest that the result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords - that the applicant could be convicted of attempted rape, irrespective of his relationship with the victim - cannot be said to be at variance with the object and purpose of Article 7 (art. 7) of the Convention, namely to ensure that no one should be subjected to arbitrary prosecution, conviction or punishment (see paragraph 32 above).  What is more, the abandonment of the unacceptable idea of a husband being immune against prosecution for rape of his wife was in conformity not only with a civilised concept of marriage but also, and above all, with the fundamental objectives of the Convention, the very essence of which is respect for human dignity and human freedom. \r\n43.   Having reached this conclusion, the Court does not find it necessary to enquire into whether the facts in the applicant’s case were covered by the exceptions to the immunity rule already made by the English courts before 12 November 1989. \r\n44.   In short, the Court, like the Government and the Commission, finds that the national courts’ decisions that the applicant could not invoke immunity to escape conviction and sentence for attempted rape upon his wife did not give rise to a violation of his rights under Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention. \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY \r\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 7 para. 1 (art. 7-1) of the Convention. \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 22 November 1995. \r\n\r\n\t\tRolv RYSSDAL\r\n\t\tPresident\r\n\t\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\n",

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 17101/90)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n21 September 1990 \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the case of Fayed v. the United Kingdom,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of the Rules of Court, as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tR. BERNHARDT,\r\n\tMr \tC. RUSSO,\r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS,\r\n\tMr \tR. PEKKANEN,\r\n\tMr \tA.N. LOIZOU,\r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND,\r\n\tMr \tL. WILDHABER,\r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK,\r\nand also of Mr M.-A. EISSEN, Registrar, and Mr H. PETZOLD, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 25 March and 25 August 1994,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 12 July 1993, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 17101/90) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 30 August 1990 by Mr Mohamed Al Fayed, Mr Ali Fayed and Mr Salah Fayed, who are Egyptian citizens, and by a company they owned, namely House of Fraser Holdings PLC.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 6 para. 1 and 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13) of the Convention.\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 25 August 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mrs E. Palm, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr F. Bigi, Mr L. Wildhaber and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr R. Pekkanen and Mr C. Russo, substitute judges, replaced respectively Mr Pettiti, who had withdrawn, and Mr Bigi and Mrs Palm, who were prevented from taking further part in the consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 paras. 1 to 3).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\"the Government\"), the applicants’ lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 10 January 1994 and the applicants’ memorial on 24 January 1994, the applicants’ supplementary memorial on 1 March 1994, the Government’s supplementary observations on 16 March 1994, and the applicants’ and the Government’s comments on the claims for just satisfaction on 10 and 18 March respectively. In a letter received on 3 March 1994 the Secretary to the Commission had informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to submit argument in writing.\r\n5.   On 5 October 1993 the British company, Lonrho PLC (see paragraphs 10 and following below) sought leave to submit written comments under Rule 37 para. 2. However, by letter received at the registry on 17 November 1993 the company withdrew its request.\r\n6.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 March 1994.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n- for the Government\r\n\t\tMrs A.F. GLOVER, Legal Counsellor,\r\n\t\t\tForeign and Commonwealth Office, \tAgent,\r\n\t\tMr M. BAKER, QC,\r\n\t\tMr J. EADIE, Barrister-at-law, \tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMrs T. DUNSTAN, Department of Trade and Industry,\r\n\t\tMr R. BURNS, Department of Trade and Industry,\r\n\t\tMr J. GARDNER, Department of Trade and Industry, \tAdvisers;\r\n- for the Commission\r\n\t\tSir Basil HALL, \tDelegate;\r\n- for the applicants\r\n\t\tLord Lester of HERNE HILL, QC,\r\n\t\tMr P. GOULDING, Barrister-at-law, \tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr R. FLECK,\r\n\t\tMs L. HUTCHINSON, Solicitors,\r\n\t\tMr D. MARVIN, Attorney-at-law (Washington, DC, USA),\r\n\t\tMr R. WEBB, Legal Director,\r\n\t\t\tHouse of Fraser Holdings PLC, \tAdvisers.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Sir Basil Hall, Mr Baker and Lord Lester, and also replies to questions put by the President.\r\nOn the day of the hearing and subsequently on 12 April 1994 the applicants produced to the Court a number of documents referred to in argument by Lord Lester.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\nA. The applicants\r\n7.   The three applicants, Mr Mohamed Al Fayed, Mr Ali Fayed and Mr Salah Fayed, are brothers. They are businessmen.\r\nB. Takeover of the House of Fraser PLC\r\n8.   In March 1985 the applicants acquired ownership of the House of Fraser PLC (\"HOF\"), a public company, for about £600 million in cash. HOF was then, and is now, one of the largest groups of department stores in Europe and includes one particularly well-known London store, Harrods. The acquisition of HOF was effected through a public company called House of Fraser Holdings PLC (\"HOFH\"), which at all material times was owned by the applicants. HOFH had previously been known as the Al Fayed Investment Trust (UK) Limited and assumed its present name in December 1985.\r\n9.   Prior to the HOF takeover, in or about early November 1984, the applicants appointed public relations consultants. With the latter’s assistance, the brothers and their direct advisers led the press to receive and present a positive picture of their origins, wealth, business interests and resources. Upon the basis of this picture, which they had a part in painting, they enjoyed, for a time, an esteem or reputation which was highly valuable to them. Between 2 and 10 November 1984 the first applicant gave separate interviews to The Observer, The Sunday Telegraph and The Daily Mail. A further interview involving the brothers took place on 10 March 1985. In these interviews the brothers described a wealthy, distinguished and established family background. They gave a similar picture to their merchant banker, who accepted it and, acting on their behalf, conveyed that picture by a press release in November 1984 and in a television interview in early March 1985. There were other press interviews about the family background for which the applicants were responsible.\r\nThey thus took active steps to promote their own reputations in the public domain. The acceptance of the brothers by the City of London and by the Government was later considered to be crucial to an understanding of the events surrounding their takeover of HOF.\r\n10.   The takeover was vigorously but unsuccessfully opposed by Lonrho PLC (\"Lonrho\") and, in particular, its Chief Executive, Mr Rowland, a former business associate, turned rival, of the applicants.\r\nFrom about 1981, if not earlier, it had been Lonrho’s wish to acquire HOF. In December 1981, following a report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (\"the Secretary of State\") had sought and obtained from Lonrho undertakings not to acquire or control any further shareholdings beyond its then level of 29.9% of HOF. Thereafter Lonrho had sought to be released from these undertakings.\r\nIn 1984 Lonrho had sold its share-holding in HOF to the applicants, but when those directors representing Lonrho’s interests were obliged to resign from HOF’s Board and the applicants bid to take over HOF completely, relations between Lonrho and the applicants deteriorated. Lonrho proceeded to launch an acrimonious campaign against the applicants. In opposing the applicants’ bid for HOF, Lonrho had made submissions to Ministers concerning unfair competition and the undesirability of HOF falling into foreign hands. It was alleged that the applicants were fraudulently claiming that the funds for the acquisition were theirs personally. Lonrho asserted that the brothers were lying about their money and themselves and that they should not be permitted to acquire HOF without a thorough inquiry. However, the applicants’ bid was cleared by the Department of Trade and Industry (\"DTI\") and accepted by the HOF Board. In March 1985 the Secretary of State decided, on the recommendation of the Director General of Fair Trading, not to refer the applicants’ proposed acquisition to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as had been done in the case of the earlier bid by Lonrho. The decision of Government clearance was expressly described at the time by the DTI as having been influenced by the statements made and assurances given by and on behalf of the Fayed brothers about their bid. Lonrho nevertheless campaigned on through the media and other publications, and in particular through The Observer, a newspaper it owned.\r\n11.   The applicants instructed their solicitors to threaten and, if necessary, institute libel proceedings if anything were published putting in doubt their claim to be the beneficial owners of the funds used to acquire HOF. This policy affected several publications, including The Observer. In almost every instance the threat of action led to the publication of a retraction. The applicants instituted three libel actions against The Observer in 1985 and 1986 for articles written about them. One central issue in these actions was the truth or not of The Observer’s allegation that the funds used by the applicants in their takeover of HOF were not their own.\r\n12.   In March 1987 Lonrho commenced legal proceedings against the applicants and their bankers alleging wrongful interference with Lonrho’s business, and conspiracy and negligence in connection with HOFH’s acquisition of HOF. In particular, it was alleged that the applicants, by false statements about their financial capacity to acquire the share capital and develop HOF’s business, had persuaded HOF’s Board of Directors to accept their bid and had convinced the Secretary of State not to refer their bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It was claimed that the applicants had thereby tortiously interfered with Lonrho’s right to bid for the shares or, alternatively, they had conspired against Lonrho.\r\nLonrho unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s refusal to refer the applicants’ acquisition of HOF to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.\r\nC. Appointment of the Inspectors and their investigation\r\n13.   On 9 April 1987, after two years of unrelenting pressure by Lonrho upon the Government, the Secretary of State appointed two Inspectors to investigate the affairs of HOFH and, in particular, the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of shares in HOF in 1984 and 1985. The appointment of the Inspectors was made by the Secretary of State under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 (see paragraph 36 below). They were told at the time of their appointment, and they so informed the applicants, that an area of particular concern to the Secretary of State was the validity of the assurances given by the applicants and their advisers in March 1985 (Inspectors’ report, paragraphs 1.10, 23.1.9 and 26.19).\r\n14.   In their subsequent report the Inspectors described the applicants’ takeover bid as being unusual, not least because it was a bid involving huge sums of money by three individuals and, since the offerers were individuals, the corporate balance sheets and other financial statements which are customary on such occasions were totally absent (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 21.1.1). In order to establish what had occurred during the takeover, they had been obliged to make findings on vigorously contested issues of fact (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 1.7).\r\nThe principal questions they addressed when investigating the affairs of HOFH were listed in their report as follows:\r\n\"(i)   Were the Fayeds who they said they were, and if not who were they?\r\n(ii)   Did they acquire HOF with their own unencumbered funds?\r\n(iii)  Did they deliberately mislead, whether directly or indirectly, those who represented them to the authorities and the public?\r\n(iv)   If so, did they seek to frustrate those who tried to establish the true facts, and if so how?\r\n(v)   What steps did the Board of HOF and its advisers take before they gave the comfort that they appeared to give to those who relied on their words or actions?\r\n(vi)   Were the authorities - the officials of the [Office of Fair Trading] and the DTI and, eventually, Ministers - or the public misled about the Fayeds? If so, how and why?\"\r\n(The Inspectors’ report, paragraph 1.11)\r\nThe Inspectors also stated that, throughout their investigation, they were not concerned solely with simple questions relating to the direct control of the purchase money which was used to buy HOF. They were also concerned about the veracity of the statements which the applicants made, or which they allowed others to make on their behalf, which had the effect of influencing people to act favourably towards them (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 1.12; and also chapter 9).\r\n15.   During the course of the investigation, the Inspectors identified matters upon which they wished to receive evidence. If any uncertainty or issue arose in relation to the provision of such evidence, these were discussed in the course of meetings or through correspondence between the Inspectors’ staff and the applicants’ solicitors. Thereafter, information was provided to the Inspectors by way of memoranda, together with copy documentation. In addition, the Inspectors received oral evidence by interviewing witnesses on oath. Mr Mohamed Al Fayed and Mr Ali Fayed were interviewed, in the presence of their lawyers, on 14 October 1987 and again on 8 and 9 March 1988. All proceedings were conducted in private. There was no opportunity for the applicants to confront or cross-examine witnesses, it being well-established as a matter of English law that the Inspectors were not obliged to afford such an opportunity to anyone.\r\n16.   It was agreed between the Inspectors and the applicants that, having assimilated the factual information supplied, the Inspectors would notify the applicants of the provisional conclusions they had reached and the material upon which they had relied in reaching such conclusions. The Inspectors would then consider such submissions as the applicants might make in respect of these conclusions.\r\n17.   Respect for personal privacy was known to be a matter of especial concern to the applicants. The Inspectors’ approach to matters of privacy and confidentiality is summed up in their report (at paragraphs 26.44 - 45) as follows:\r\n\"[I]f private people incorporate a company, in which they become directors, and which makes public representations about their affairs, Inspectors who are appointed to investigate the truth of those representations must balance their concern to preserve the directors’ privacy as far as practicable ... against their duty to do the job which they were appointed to perform.\r\nIf the Fayeds had chosen to say nothing this might have created evidential difficulties for us. But because they wished us to make findings in their favour they brought witnesses to see us ... and gave us evidence about their private affairs which it was then our duty to test.\"\r\n18.   At the start of the investigation the applicants expressly accepted that the Inspectors were entitled to inquire into the accuracy of statements which had been made by them or on their behalf in late 1984 and early 1985. These were the statements at the heart of the investigation. Only at the very end of the investigation, when they were confronted by the Inspectors with \"overwhelming evidence\" that they had been telling lies, did they resile from that stance and challenge the Inspectors’ entitlement to look into certain aspects of their private life (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 26.28).\r\nThe Inspectors rejected the challenge and gave their reasons for so doing (see generally chapter 16 of the Inspectors’ report). The Inspectors were entitled to seek confidential information from third parties, but before doing so they gave the applicants an opportunity to satisfy them as to the accuracy of the statements \"in whatever manner was least obtrusive to their privacy\" (Inspectors’ report, paragraphs 16.2.5 and 16.6.2). The law did not permit them to compel the applicants to produce personal bank statements (which would have gone far to confirm or refute the accuracy of the statements) nor, save to a very limited extent, did the applicants consent to such production. The Inspectors considered that the applicants were in breach of their duty to give all the assistance which they were reasonably required to give. By virtue of section 436 of the 1985 Act the Inspectors could have certified this to a court, which could then have taken steps to sanction the applicants if, after hearing evidence, it was satisfied that they were in breach of their duty (see paragraph 38 below). The Inspectors were, however, of the opinion that they could complete their task without the need to resort to such a serious measure and chose to pursue the matter without making such a certificate. They made clear that if the applicants chose not to give evidence, they, the Inspectors, would be entitled to draw inferences from such failure.\r\n19.   In October 1987 and thereafter Lonrho publicly criticised the conduct of the investigation by the Inspectors and sought an additional two-month period in which to assemble and submit evidence to them. Through its lawyers, Lonrho argued that the rules of natural justice required the Inspectors to allow Lonrho access to the information the Inspectors had received from the applicants because Lonrho’s commercial reputation would suffer if the Inspectors dismissed the complaints which it had made so publicly. The Inspectors dismissed Lonrho’s application for access to the applicants’ evidence, but permitted Lonrho to have a longer period in which to adduce evidence to them, relating primarily to the personal background of the applicants and their family. The applicants’ solicitors in turn protested to the Inspectors vigorously about this latter decision. The written material provided to the Inspectors by Lonrho ran to thousands of pages. The Inspectors accepted that Lonrho and its directors had pursued their ends in a remarkably single-minded manner, and they described the applicants and Lonrho as \"bitterly antagonistic parties\" (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 26.71).\r\nD. The Inspectors’ report and its follow-up, including consideration of criminal and civil proceedings\r\n20.   The Inspectors’ provisional conclusions, which exceeded 500 pages of text and were, in large part, unfavourable to the applicants, were made available to the applicants on 12 April 1988. The Inspectors had previously made known to the applicants the gist of the adverse evidence received and the conclusions that they, the Inspectors, might be disposed to draw from that evidence.\r\nBetween 12 April and 17 June there was no significant response from the applicants. On the latter date the applicants’ solicitors informed the Inspectors that they were not even in a position to discuss the procedural situation of the inquiry. The Inspectors told the applicants’ solicitors on 20 June that by 15 July the Inspectors would consider that they had had ample time to respond to the provisional conclusions. On that date the applicants lodged detailed submissions running to 571 pages and containing a mixture of factual analysis and legal argument and, quite often, new evidence. The argument sought to limit the scope of the inquiry very drastically. The applicants’ solicitors requested the Inspectors, as \"the basic minimum which fairness required\", to deal with certain questions raised and, if rejecting any of their principal submissions, to state reasons before issuing any report (Inspectors’ report , paragraph 1.23 and chapter 17).\r\n21.   On 23 July 1988 the Inspectors delivered their report to the Secretary of State, in broadly the same terms as their provisional conclusions. They explained that they had not acceded to the applicants’ ultimate procedural request because they were of the view that otherwise the completion of their report might be indefinitely delayed:\r\n\"It appeared to us that the appropriate course for us to take would be to consider the written submissions we had received and to express our views on them when we submitted our report to the Secretary of State. Our findings would not be dispositive of anything, we had given HOFH, HOF, the Fayeds and their advisers ample time to make their submissions, which they had chosen to make in this way at this extremely late stage and we considered that it was in the public interest that we should now complete our work and submit our report.\"\r\n22.   The Inspectors concluded that the applicants had dishonestly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to the Secretary of State, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the HOF Board and HOF shareholders and their own advisers; that during the course of their investigations, the Inspectors had received evidence from the applicants, under solemn affirmation and in written memoranda, which was false and which the applicants knew to be false; in addition, that the applicants had produced a set of documents they knew to be false; that this evidence related mainly, but not exclusively, to their background, their past business activities and the way in which they came to be in control of enormous funds in the autumn of 1984 and the spring of 1985 (see especially Inspectors’ report, chapter 2). The Inspectors were satisfied that the main thrust of Lonrho’s attack on the applicants was well founded on a sound basis of substantiated fact (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 1.20).\r\nHowever, the Inspectors did not reject the entirety of the applicants’ evidence and praised part of their work. Thus the report included, for example, findings that \"the departure of the Lonrho directors and their replacement by the Fayeds brought harmony to a board where previously discord had existed\" (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 6.6.9); and that \"the Fayeds’ considerable ability to identify assets with a potential for capital appreciation has undoubtedly been an important element in their business success\" (Inspectors’ report, paragraph 12.6.10). In the final chapter of the report the Inspectors made complimentary findings of fact and expressed favourable opinions about HOFH. They regarded the management of HOF since its acquisition as, subject to certain reservations, \"law-abiding, proper and regular\".\r\n23.   The Secretary of State passed the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office. On 29 September 1988 the DTI announced that publication of the report would be delayed until the Serious Fraud Office had completed its investigations. In the summer of 1988 the Secretary of State also sent copies of the report to the Bank of England, the City Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (which is an integral part of the system of regulation of business in the United Kingdom), the Inland Revenue, the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.\r\n24.   On 9 November 1988 the Secretary of State announced that, consistent with the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading, he had decided against the referral of HOFH’s acquisition of HOF to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, even though the Inspectors’ report did disclose new material facts.\r\nAlso in November 1988 Lonrho made an application for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decisions (i) not to publish the report immediately and (ii) not to refer the acquisition to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in the light of the report. In the context of these proceedings the Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions submitted affidavits in December 1988 stating their opinion that publication of the report would prejudice the criminal investigation and run the risk of preventing a fair trial in the event of criminal proceedings subsequently being brought against the applicants. Lonrho’s application was ultimately rejected by the House of Lords in May 1989.\r\n25.   On 30 March 1989 The Observer newspaper published a sixteen-page special midweek edition devoted solely to extracts from and comments on a leaked copy of the Inspectors’ report. On the same day, Lonrho posted between 2,000 and 3,000 copies of the special edition to persons named on a mailing list to whom Lonrho had been regularly sending literature hostile to the applicants. The High Court immediately granted injunctions, on the applications of the Secretary of State and HOFH, restraining any further disclosure of the report or its contents.\r\n26.   During the course of a radio interview broadcast on 4 April 1989, the Secretary of State stated, prior to its publication, that the Inspectors’ report \"clearly disclosed wrongdoing\". This gave rise to substantial press coverage.\r\n27.   On 1 March 1990 the Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that their inquiries into the matter were complete (see paragraph 23 above) and that they would not be taking further action. In a joint statement issued on that date they said:\r\n\"The directors are now satisfied that all lines of inquiry have been pursued and that the evidence available is insufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offence relating to any matter of substance raised in the report.\"\r\nThe Attorney General expressed himself satisfied that the conclusion reached by the two directors was the correct one on the basis of the admissible and available evidence. On 12 March 1990 he stated to the House of Commons, in reply to a question (Hansard, House of Commons, 12 March 1990, column 14):\r\n\"Whereas it was open to the Inspectors to take account of hearsay evidence if they thought that it was reliable - and of course it was open to them to reach the conclusion that they did - it would not have been open to a jury in a criminal case to convict upon evidence of the same character. The Inspectors are entitled to take account of evidence covering a wider scope than that available in criminal proceedings in an English court ... Inquiries were pursued in every part of the world indicated by the Inspectors’ report, but the [Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions] had to conclude, as they said in their joint statement issued on 1 March, that there was insufficient evidence available for use in an English court in English criminal proceedings on any matter of substance raised in the Inspectors’ report to warrant the bringing of criminal proceedings.\"\r\nE. Publication of the Inspectors’ report\r\n28.   On 1 March 1990 the Secretary of State had announced his intention to publish the report on 7 March 1990. It is general policy to publish reports on public companies, of which HOFH was one (see paragraph 41 below). In addition the Government considered that in the particular case there were specific grounds of general public interest justifying publication. In their pleadings before the Commission they described these grounds as follows:\r\n\"There had been a complex and lengthy investigation, and the public were entitled to learn the result of that investigation unless there were compelling reasons why they should not. There were important lessons to be learnt by those involved in takeovers from studying the report. ... The report contained a recommendation that certain features of part XIV of the 1985 Act (which deals with the investigation of companies and their affairs) deserved to be reconsidered in the light of difficulties encountered by the Inspectors ... It was appropriate to acknowledge that the Secretary of State, the [Office of Fair Trading], the DTI, certain journalists and sections of the press, the Board of HOF, the regulatory authorities, and the applicants’ professional advisers had been misled by the applicants. Lonrho considered that its interests and reputation had been seriously and adversely affected by the preparedness of the Secretary of State to allow the HOFH bid to go forward in March 1985 without a reference to the [Monopolies and Mergers Commission]. Lonrho would have had a legitimate grievance if the explanation for this was suppressed without compelling reasons. There was a need to dispel continuing speculation as to the events which had given rise to the investigation. Rumours and speculation were rife. Publication of the report would provide employees and creditors with information concerning the way in which HOF and Harrods had been run and might be expected to be run in future. (The Inspectors were largely prepared to accept the sincerity of the brothers’ assurances for the future.) The brothers had been prepared before the Inspectors to attempt to discredit Lonrho, Mr Rowland, The Observer, its editor and others. It was deemed to be in the public interest to publicise both the fact that these attempts had been made and the conclusion of the Inspectors that they were ill-founded.\"\r\n29.   On 2 March 1990, the applicants were provided with pre-publication copies of the report in confidence, in order to enable them to consider their position.\r\nThroughout the period between submission of the report to the Secretary of State in July 1988 and its publication on 7 March 1990 the applicants’ solicitors had adopted, in extensive correspondence with the DTI and the Treasury Solicitor, the position that judicial review or other court proceedings were likely to be taken, on the basis, inter alia, that the Inspectors’ report did not constitute a valid report under the Companies Act 1985 because of the scope of the investigation and alleged procedural unfairness (including departures from what the applicants alleged was an agreed procedure). By letter dated 1 March 1990 the DTI undertook that if the applicants were to apply for judicial review to challenge the validity of the report, publication would be held up pending the final determination by the courts of their application. In the event no such proceedings were commenced. According to the applicants, the possibility of applying for judicial review to prevent publication was kept under consideration by them and their advisers, but the unanimous view at all stages was that such proceedings were almost inevitably bound to fail.\r\n30.   On 7 March 1990, the day the report was published, the Secretary of State stated to the House of Commons (Hansard, House of Commons, 7 March 1990, column 873):\r\n\"I should explain to the House that in this matter I have three main responsibilities as Secretary of State: first, to decide whether to publish the report. This I have now done as soon as possible after I was informed by the prosecution authorities that they had withdrawn their objection to publication. Second, I had to consider whether to apply to the court to disqualify any director under section 8 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. I have concluded that it would not be in the public interest to do so. Anyone who reads the report can decide for themselves what they think of the conduct of those involved. Third, I also have responsibility for decisions on whether to refer mergers to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. That responsibility was fully discharged by my predecessor. He had six months from July 1988 in which to consider the findings of the Inspectors’ report and to decide whether to refer the matter. He concluded in November 1988 that a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would not be appropriate ...\r\nNo other matters require action from me. I have passed the report to all those authorities concerned with enforcement and regulation so that they may consider whether to take action under their various powers.\"\r\nThe Secretary of State considered that the publication of the report and the ensuing publicity would enable people who might have dealings with the applicants in their capacity as directors to judge whether their interests were likely to be at risk from the type of conduct described in the report (ibid., column 878).\r\n31.   The Secretary of State also publicly expressed his own view as to the correctness of the Inspectors’ findings. On 28 March 1990 he told a Parliamentary Select Committee (House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee report on company investigations, 2 May 1990, HC 36, Annex 6, p. 183, paras. 938, 940A):\r\n\"... the allegations in the report have not been substantiated in a court of law. We can all take our view about them and I think that the balance of probability is extremely strong that they are accurate, but there is no proof of this.\r\n...\r\nI am not required to say that every fact and opinion in the report is true. These were outside Inspectors who were appointed to look into these matters, and they published their report. I have no means of checking it word for word. I myself and I think most people are inclined to believe that the events revealed are correct, but we have no proof - that is all I am saying.\r\n...\r\n[Question:] It appears that [the applicants] even told a succession of lies to the Inspectors themselves, who were then investigating the lies they had already told. Is that right?\r\n[Secretary of State:] It so appears.\"\r\nThe Select Committee accepted the Inspectors’ findings as authoritative, referring in its subsequent report to the \"misinformation concerning the financial status of the Fayed brothers\" recounted in the Inspectors’ report (Trade and Industry Committee report, loc. cit., p. xxvi, para. 126).\r\n32.   On the day of the publication of the report the applicants issued a press communiqué through HOFH commenting on, inter alia, the contents of the report and the conduct of the Inspectors. Part of this press release read as follows:\r\n\"It is appalling to discover that two people in such a position could have gone so badly off the rails in the conduct of this investigation.\r\n...\r\nThe Inspectors misled us.\r\nThey misled our lawyers. Indeed they were not even honest with them.\r\nThey demonstrated prejudice towards us and they did not treat us even-handedly.\r\nThey reneged on their agreements with us.\r\nThey have employed language which has no place in such a document.\r\nThey have reached conclusions which they do not support with facts.\r\nThey have dishonoured themselves and the whole procedure of Department of Trade inquiries.\r\nThese Inspectors went far beyond their legal powers, enquiring into matters that were no legitimate concern to them.\r\nThey completely disregarded the principles of natural justice. In simple terms they did not give us a fair hearing. They reversed the burden of proof in a denial of the basic tenet of British justice. They have held us to be guilty, unless proven innocent.\"\r\n33.   On 28 March 1990, in the course of a debate in the House of Lords, the Minister of State for Trade and Industry stated (Hansard, House of Lords, 28 March 1990, columns 946-47):\r\n\"Although the Inspectors concluded that the Fayeds lied to the competition authorities at the time of the merger - I have no reason to believe that they were wrong, but it is for individuals to make up their own minds once they have read the report - the Inspectors did not criticise the Fayeds for the way they were running the House of Fraser which they already owned and which cannot be taken away from them. In these circumstances, [the Secretary of State] considered that publication of the report, which would allow people to judge for themselves whether they wished to do business with the Fayeds, would be a severe blow to their reputation, as indeed I think it has proved.\"\r\nF. Aftermath of publication\r\n34.   The report and its findings were widely reported on television, radio and in the national press. The applicants claimed that it very seriously damaged their personal and commercial reputations as the Minister had predicted.\r\nIn August 1990 they abandoned their libel actions against The Observer newspaper and paid the latter’s £500,000 legal costs. At the time the Court of Appeal was about to hear an appeal brought by the applicants on a preliminary procedural question. Failure in this appeal would have had the consequence of obliging the applicants to disclose a number of crucial documents bearing on the issue of the possible financing of the acquisition of HOF by third-party funds. According to the applicants, they discontinued the libel actions as a result of legal advice that publication of the Inspectors’ report had deprived them of any effective remedy (see paragraph 11 above).\r\nOne month after the publication of the report the Bank of England served notice of restrictions on Harrods Bank Ltd in relation to the applicants’ positions within that company. The Parliamentary Select Committee considered that the Secretary of State had not taken sufficient action against the applicants (Trade and Industry Committee report on company investigations, loc. cit., pp. xxv-xxvii, paras. 118-40). The City Takeover Panel subsequently disciplined the applicants, in reliance on the report. As the Takeover Panel made clear, it did not seek to conduct its own investigation into the facts, but relied on the Inspectors’ report. The penalty imposed was public censure.\r\n35.   Lonrho persisted with its attacks. In May 1990 it applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s refusal to apply to the High Court for an order disqualifying the three applicants as directors. This application was dismissed on 21 October 1991.\r\nIn October 1993 it was announced that a settlement had been negotiated between the applicant brothers and Lonrho, the terms of which included the discontinuance of all proceedings between the two parties.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\nA. Basis and scope of a section 432 (2) investigation\r\n36.   The investigation of HOFH was conducted under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of shares in HOF in 1984 and 1985. Section 432 (2) empowers the Secretary of State to appoint Inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and to report on them in such manner as he directs if it appears to him that there are circumstances suggesting wrongdoing, within the categories of wrongdoing defined as follows:\r\n\"(a) that the company’s affairs are being or have been conducted with intent to defraud its creditors or the creditors of any other person, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to some part of its members, or\r\n(b)   that any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or\r\n(c)   that persons concerned with the company’s formation or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards it or towards its members, or\r\n(d)   that the company’s members have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect.\"\r\n37.   The Secretary of State is under no statutory obligation to disclose to the company concerned the reasons for the appointment of Inspectors to investigate its affairs (Norwest Holst Limited v. Secretary of State [1978] 3 Weekly Law Reports 73 (Court of Appeal)); nor does he generally do so. In the present case, when requested by the House of Lords to do so in the course of Lonrho’s judicial review applications, counsel for the Government stated that the Secretary of State had acted under section 432 (2) (a) in appointing the Inspectors.\r\nB. Inspectors’ powers to obtain information\r\n38.   Section 434 confers wide powers upon the Inspectors to obtain information, if necessary by compulsion, from officers and agents of the company whose affairs are being investigated. An answer given by a person to a question put to him in exercise of powers conferred by section 434 may be used in evidence against him (section 434 (5)). Under section 436 obstruction of the Inspectors may be certified by them to a court, which may, after enquiry, treat it as a contempt of court punishable by imprisonment or fine.\r\nC. Inspectors’ duty to act fairly\r\n39.   The Inspectors are bound by the rules of natural justice; they have a duty to act fairly and to give anyone whom they propose to criticise in their report a fair opportunity to answer what is alleged against them (In re Pergamon Press Ltd [1971] 1 Chancery 388 (Court of Appeal)). The Inspectors in the present case accepted as applicable to them the principle of natural justice whereby a person exercising an investigatory jurisdiction must base his or her findings on material having probative value (Inspectors’ report, paragraphs 26.23 and 26.25 - citing Mahon v. Air New Zealand [1985] Appeal Cases 808 (Privy Council), at pp. 820-21).\r\nHowever, proceedings before the Inspectors are administrative in form, not judicial; the Inspectors are not a court of law and they are masters of their own procedure (In re Pergamon Press Ltd, loc. cit., pp. 399-400, per Lord Denning MR; pp. 406-07, per Buckley LJ). Except for the duty to act fairly, Inspectors are not subject to any set rules or procedures and are free to act at their own discretion. There is no right for a person who is at risk of being criticised by the Inspectors to cross-examine witnesses (ibid., p. 400B, per Lord Denning MR). It is not necessary for the Inspectors to put their tentative conclusions to the witnesses in order to give them a chance to refute them. It is sufficient in law for the Inspectors to put to the witnesses what has been said against them by other persons or in documents to enable them to deal with those criticisms in the course of the investigation (Maxwell v. Department of Trade and Industry [1974] 1 Queen’s Bench 523 (Court of Appeal)).\r\nD. Publication of the report of an investigation\r\n40.   The Secretary of State is empowered by section 437 (3) (c) to decide whether or not to print and publish the Inspectors’ report. Although he has a very wide discretion in deciding whether or not to publish the whole report, he is precluded by section 437 (3) (c) from deciding to publish only parts or a synopsis of it.\r\nPublication may be deferred if there is a possibility that criminal proceedings may be taken, in order to avoid the possibility of prejudice to such proceedings.\r\n41.   The question whether an Inspector’s report should be published is considered in each case on its merits. The DTI’s general policy is to publish reports on public companies wherever possible, as being matters of public interest.\r\nMembers of a limited company are in a privileged legal position because their liability is limited. In view of this privilege, where the Secretary of State has decided that the affairs of a large public company should be investigated under the provisions of section 432 of the 1985 Act, because he is satisfied that the circumstances are of sufficient concern to warrant the substantial cost of an inspection, it is important that the Inspectors’ report explaining the underlying facts and the conclusions that they draw from them should be made public unless there are overriding reasons to the contrary.\r\nE. Inspectors’ liability in defamation\r\n42.   The defence of privilege or immunity in defamation cases rests upon the idea that conduct which would otherwise be actionable escapes liability because the defendant is acting in furtherance of some interest of social importance which is entitled to protection, even at the expense of uncompensated harm to the plaintiff’s reputation. If the interest is one of paramount importance, considerations of policy may require that the defendant’s immunity for false statements be absolute, without regard to his purpose or motive or the reasonableness of his conduct. Such is the nature of the absolute protection afforded to judicial and parliamentary proceedings. Also on grounds of public policy, a defence of qualified privilege may lie when the publication is made by a person in good faith and in the discharge of some public or private duty. The condition attached to qualified privilege is that it must be exercised in a reasonable manner and for a proper purpose. A publisher with malicious intent would lose the defence of qualified privilege.\r\n43.   In re Pergamon Press Ltd (loc. cit., at p. 400G) Lord Denning MR stated:\r\n\"Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness, keeping nothing back. The public interest demands it. They need have no fear because their report, so far as I can judge, is protected by an absolute privilege ...\"\r\nEven if, contrary to Lord Denning’s observation, the Inspectors’ report is subject to a qualified rather than an absolute privilege, neither the Inspectors nor the Secretary of State could be successfully sued for defamation in publishing the report, except upon proof of express malice (that is, the desire to injure as the dominant motive for the defamatory publication: see Horrocks v. Lowe [1975] Appeal Cases 135 (House of Lords), at p. 149, per Lord Diplock).\r\nF. Judicial review\r\n44.   The grounds on which administrative action (such as the Secretary of State’s decision to publish the report) is subject to judicial control are the three traditional grounds of judicial review described by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ([1985] Appeal Cases 375 (House of Lords), at pp. 410-11). These grounds are illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.\r\n\"Illegality\" means that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it.\r\n\"Irrationality\", or what is often also referred to as \"Wednesbury unreasonableness\" (see Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation [1947] 1 King’s Bench 223 (Court of Appeal)), applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. \"‘Irrationality’ or ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’ is a narrowly restricted ground of judicial review of an administrative decision. Where the existence or non-existence of a fact is left to the judgment and discretion of a public body and that fact involves a broad spectrum ranging from the obvious to the debatable to the just conceivable, it is the duty of the court to leave the decision of fact to the public body to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision-making power save in a case where it is obvious that the public body, consciously or unconsciously, are acting perversely\" (per Lord Brightman, in R. v. Hillingdon LBC, ex parte Puhlhofer [1986] Appeal Cases 484 (House of Lords), p. 528).\r\n\"Procedural impropriety\" covers failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision, as well as failure to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice.\r\n45.   Judicial review would, for example, provide a remedy if Inspectors under the Companies Act were prejudiced or biased against the subjects of their report (Franklin v. Minister of Town and County Planning [1948] Appeal Cases 87 (House of Lords)); or if the Inspectors reached conclusions which there were no facts to support, or took into account irrelevant considerations, or failed to take account of relevant considerations, or reached conclusions which no reasonable person in their position could have reached (the Wednesbury case, loc. cit.); or if their findings have not been properly based on material which has probative value (Mahon v. Air New Zealand, loc. cit.); or if the Inspectors were dishonest or acted in bad faith (the Wednesbury case, loc. cit.); or if the Inspectors acted ultra vires or beyond their legal powers (the Wednesbury case, loc. cit.); or if the Inspectors acted against the legitimate expectations of those concerned (Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service, loc. cit.); or if the Inspectors acted contrary to the rules of natural justice (Wiseman v. Borneman [1971] Appeal Cases 297 (House of Lords)); or if the Inspectors acted unfairly (In re Pergamon Press, loc. cit.; Maxwell v. Department of Trade, loc. cit.; R. v. Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, ex parte Guinness PLC [1990] 1 Queen’s Bench 146 (Court of Appeal)).\r\nHowever, a mistake of fact could not form the basis of a challenge to an administrative decision by the Inspectors or the Secretary of State unless the fact was a condition precedent to an exercise of jurisdiction, or the fact was the only evidential basis for a decision, or the fact was as to a matter which expressly or impliedly had to be taken into account (R. v. London Residuary Body, ex parte Inner London Education Authority, Times Law Reports, 24 July 1987 (Divisional Court)).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n46.   The three applicant brothers and the company HOFH lodged an application (no. 17101/90) with the Commission on 30 August 1990.\r\nThe applicants contended that, in violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, the Inspectors’ report had determined their civil right to honour and reputation and denied them effective access to a court in determination of this civil right. They further alleged a denial of effective domestic remedies to challenge the findings of the Inspectors, contrary to both Article 6 para. 1 and Article 13 (art. 6-1, art. 13) of the Convention.\r\nIn addition, they claimed that the making and publication of the Inspectors’ report had determined criminal charges against them and violated the presumption of innocence, in breach of Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2); and had unjustifiably interfered with their honour and reputation, protected as part of their right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, and with the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions as guaranteed under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1).\r\n47.   On 15 May 1992 the Commission declared admissible the complaint of the three applicant brothers under the \"civil\" branch of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, both on its own and in relation to Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention. The remainder of the application, including the grievance of the fourth applicant company, was declared inadmissible.\r\n48.   In its report of 7 April 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31) the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), either as regards the making and publication of the Inspectors’ report (twelve votes to one) or as regards the applicant brothers’ access to court whether for proceeding against the Inspectors and the Secretary of State (ten votes to three) or for proceeding against others (twelve votes to one). The Commission further concluded (unanimously) that no separate issue arose under Article 13 (art. 13).\r\nThe full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n49.   At the public hearing on 23 March 1994 the Government maintained in substance the concluding submission set out in their memorial, whereby they invited the Court to hold\r\n\"(1) that the application is inadmissible because of failure by the applicants to exhaust domestic remedies;\r\n (2) alternatively, (a) that there has been no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and (b) that there has been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention or that no separate issue arises for examination under Article 13 (art. 13)\".\r\n50.   On the same occasion the applicants likewise maintained in substance the conclusions formulated at the close of their memorial, whereby they requested the Court\r\n\"to decide and declare that they are the victims of breaches of Article 6 (art. 6), and to afford just satisfaction to them under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention\".\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   THE GOVERNMENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\r\n51.   The Government submitted that the applicants had failed to exhaust their domestic remedies in a number of respects. The Delegate of the Commission explained at the hearing that this plea, although not adverted to in the admissibility decision of 15 May 1992 because the Commission assumed that it had not been maintained, had been raised before the Commission at the appropriate time. The Court therefore has jurisdiction to entertain it (see the Artico v. Italy judgment of 13 May 1980, Series A no. 37, pp. 12-13, paras. 24 and 27).\r\n52.   According to the Government, the applicants failed to exhaust their domestic remedies (a) by not having applied for judicial review either of the Inspectors’ conduct of the inquiry or of their decision to submit their report to the Secretary of State; (b) by not having applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision to publish the Inspectors’ report; and (c) by not having pursued the libel proceedings commenced against The Observer newspaper.\r\n53.   The grounds on which judicial review may be sought (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above) are such that it would not have ensured access to a court for determination of the truth of statements made about the applicants in the Inspectors’ report, the absence of such access being the essence of their complaints under the Convention. Nor would the libel actions against The Observer, although to some extent concerned with the same subject-matter (see paragraph 11 above), have provided a remedy against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State as regards the publication of the damaging statements contained in the Inspectors’ report.\r\nThe Court therefore agrees with the Delegate of the Commission and the applicants that the plea of non-exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been made out by the Government.\r\nII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n54.   The applicants contended that the Inspectors’ investigation and, above all, the publication of the Inspectors’ report gave rise to a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), which, in so far as relevant, provides:\r\n\"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ...\"\r\nIn their submission, the making and the subsequent publication of the Inspectors’ report in its entirety seriously damaged their reputations, thereby determining their civil right to honour and reputation, and the state of English law was such that they were denied effective access to the courts to challenge the resultant interference with that civil right.\r\nThis contention was accepted neither by the Government nor by the majority of the Commission.\r\nA. Investigation by the Inspectors\r\n55.   The first stage of the applicants’ argument, which was disputed by the Government and not accepted by the Commission, was that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was applicable to the investigation by the Inspectors.\r\n56.   In order for an individual to be entitled to a hearing before a tribunal, there must exist a \"dispute\" (\"contestation\") over one of his or her civil rights or obligations. It follows, so the Court’s case-law has explained, that the result of the proceedings in question must be directly decisive for such a right or obligation, mere tenuous connections or remote consequences not being sufficient to bring Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) into play (see, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 20-22, paras. 44-50).\r\n57.   The applicants claimed to identify three different disputes (contestations) arising in and during the investigation by the Inspectors: firstly, the dispute between the applicants and Lonrho, which the applicants described as giving rise to and forming the subject-matter of the proceedings conducted by the Inspectors; secondly, a dispute between the applicants and the Inspectors, in that the applicants had contested the Inspectors’ actions in investigating their honesty and then arriving at conclusions in this regard; and, thirdly, a dispute between the applicants and the Secretary of State, in that, notwithstanding their opposition, the Secretary of State had initially considered there to be circumstances suggesting dishonest conduct by them, and had thereafter adopted the contents of the Inspectors’ report, so they asserted, and decided to publish it.\r\nIn the applicants’ submission, one of the objects of the inquiry by the Inspectors was to make findings as to whether the applicants were guilty of misconduct and the central conclusion of the report was that the applicants had dishonestly misled the authorities. Even though the Inspectors’ role may in theory have been investigative, the manner in which they performed their functions in the present case was in fact determinative. The Inspectors’ report, published to the world at large, had the force of a judgment convicting the applicants of dishonesty. The result of the inquiry was thus directly decisive for the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation. In short, so they argued, the Inspectors’ report effectively \"determined\" their civil right to reputation without any of the procedural guarantees of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) being respected.\r\n58.   Having regard to the cases of Golder v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, p. 13, para. 27) and Helmers v. Sweden (judgment of 29 October 1991, Series A no. 212-A, p. 14, para. 27), the respondent Government did not dispute the existence and \"civil\" character of the right under English law to a good reputation.\r\nHowever, they submitted that neither the investigation by the Inspectors nor the publication of the report \"determined\" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation or, indeed, any right at all. The principal purpose of the investigation and report of the Inspectors, they maintained, was to acquire, marshal and set down factual information which would enable the various competent authorities - such as the Director General of Fair Trading, the prosecuting authorities, the Bank of England, the Takeover Panel and the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 23, 27, 30 and 34 above) - to decide what action, if any, to take. Four further purposes also existed, none of which, however, included ascertaining whether the applicants merited their good reputation. These additional purposes were dispelling public speculation about the events surrounding the takeover, enabling those concerned in takeovers to learn lessons, laying the foundations for reform of company law and practice, and providing information to HOF’s employees, shareholders and creditors.\r\n59.   The Commission, after analysing the purposes served by the preparation and publication of the Inspectors’ report, came to the conclusion that the Inspectors had an \"investigative rather than determinative\" role (paragraph 64 of the Commission’s report). The Commission was therefore of the opinion that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was not applicable to the proceedings conducted by Inspectors because those proceedings did not determine any civil right or obligation of the applicants.\r\n60.   The Court notes that under the terms of section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 Inspectors can only be appointed if it appears to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more types of specified wrongdoing or unlawful action in the conduct of a company’s affairs (see paragraph 36 above). The Act confers on the Inspectors wide powers to obtain information and obstruction of the Inspectors may, upon reference by them to a court, be treated by it as a contempt of court and punished accordingly (sections 434 and 436 of the Act - see paragraph 38 above). The principal question addressed by the Inspectors in the instant case can be reduced to whether the Fayed brothers had dishonestly misled the authorities and the public in order to obtain Government clearance and acceptance by the HOF Board of their bid (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). The Inspectors’ published findings - that the applicants had indeed made dishonest representations concerning their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources and had thereafter knowingly submitted false evidence to the Inspectors (see paragraph 22 above) - undoubtedly damaged the applicants’ reputations. The competent Ministers and a Parliamentary Select Committee - quite apart, it can be supposed, from a substantial section of public opinion - showed a disposition to accept as correct these findings, publication of which was seen as a kind of sanction (see paragraphs 26, 30, 31, 33 and 34 above).\r\nSuch elements or consequences are, it is true, not infrequently found in the context of adjudicatory proceedings.\r\n61.   However, the Court is satisfied that the functions performed by the Inspectors were, in practice as well as in theory, essentially investigative (see the similar analysis by the Supreme Court of the United States of America of the function of the Federal Civil Rights Commission in the case of Hannah v. Larche (363 US 420 (1960)). The Inspectors did not adjudicate, either in form or in substance. They themselves said in their report that their findings would not be dispositive of anything (see paragraph 21 above). They did not make a legal determination as to criminal or civil liability concerning the Fayed brothers, and in particular concerning the latter’s civil right to honour and reputation. The purpose of their inquiry was to ascertain and record facts which might subsequently be used as the basis for action by other competent authorities - prosecuting, regulatory, disciplinary or even legislative.\r\nLonrho admittedly exhibited a clear interest in the inquiry and its outcome, by being instrumental in bringing about the appointment of the Inspectors, by submitting evidence and by seeking to prompt action by the Secretary of State (see paragraphs 12 in fine, 13, 19, 24, 25 and 35 above). The Inspectors described Lonrho and the Fayed brothers as \"bitterly antagonistic parties\" (see paragraph 19 in fine above). Nonetheless, whilst there was a close connection between Lonrho’s grievance against the Fayed brothers and the matters investigated by the Inspectors (see, inter alia, paragraphs 10-13 and 22 above), the object of the proceedings before the Inspectors was not to resolve any dispute (contestation) between Lonrho and the applicants. Those disputes, and in particular the applicants’ libel claims that Lonrho, through The Observer, had wrongfully damaged their reputations, were being adjudicated by the ordinary courts (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). Likewise, no dispute (contestation) between the Secretary of State or the Inspectors and the applicants as to the lawfulness of any alleged interference with the applicants’ right to reputation arose merely because the applicants contested the grounds on which the Minister decided to appoint the Inspectors and on which the Inspectors conducted their lines of inquiry.\r\nIn short, it cannot be said that the Inspectors’ inquiry \"determined\" the applicants’ civil right to a good reputation, for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), or that its result was directly decisive for that right.\r\n62.   Acceptance of the applicants’ argument would entail that a body carrying out preparatory investigations at the instance of regulatory or other authorities should always be subject to the guarantees of a judicial procedure set forth in Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) by reason of the fact that publication of its findings is liable to damage the reputation of the individuals whose conduct is being investigated. Such an interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would in practice unduly hamper the effective regulation in the public interest of complex financial and commercial activities. In the Court’s view, investigative proceedings of the kind in issue in the present case fall outside the ambit and intendment of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\n63.   The Court accordingly concludes that the investigation by the Inspectors was not such as to attract the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\nB. Proceedings to contest the Inspectors’ findings\r\n64.   The Inspectors’ report, published to the world at large, contained statements damaging to the applicants’ reputations.\r\nThe applicants argued that English law denied them their entitlement under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) to access to a court to have determined whether there was any justification for this attack on their reputations. In particular, they stated, there was no opportunity under English law, whether by way of defamation proceedings or by way of judicial review, to challenge the Inspectors’ condemnatory findings of fact or conclusions before a tribunal satisfying the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\n1. Relevant principles\r\n65.   In the words of the Court’s Golder judgment, \"... Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court or tribunal. In this way the Article (art. 6-1) embodies the ‘right to a court’, of which the right of access, that is the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only\" (loc. cit., p. 18, para. 36). This right to a court \"extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law; [Article 6 para. 1] (art. 6-1) does not in itself guarantee any particular content for (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ in the substantive law of the Contracting States\" (see, inter alia, the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 46-47, para. 81; and the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p.16, para. 36).\r\nWhether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the substantive content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court. In the latter kind of case Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) may have a degree of applicability. Certainly the Convention enforcement bodies may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) a substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the State concerned. However, it would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) - namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication - if, for example, a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons (see the Commission’s admissibility decision of 9 October 1984 on application no. 10475/83, Dyer v. the United Kingdom, Decisions and Reports 39, pp. 246-66 at pp. 251-52).\r\nThe relevant principles have been stated by the Court as follows:\r\n\"(a) The right of access to the courts secured by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is not absolute but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access ‘by its very nature calls for regulation by the State, regulation which may vary in time and in place according to the needs and resources of the community and of individuals’.\r\n(b) In laying down such regulation, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, but the final decision as to observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired.\r\n(c) Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is not a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved.\"\r\n(Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 102, p. 71, para. 194, citing the Ashingdane v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 93, pp. 24-25, para. 57)\r\nThese principles reflect the process, inherent in the Court’s task under the Convention, of striking a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights (see, inter alia, the Sporrong and Lönnroth v. Sweden judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 26, para. 69).\r\n2.  Applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n66.   In the Government’s submission, the defence of privilege delimited the very content of the applicants’ right to a good reputation as protected under English law. They maintained that, unlike procedural barriers to access to court, such an exercise by the State of the power to fix the content of a particular civil right did not bring into play Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), although it might on occasions raise an issue in relation to one or other of the substantive rights protected by the Convention (such as the right to respect for private life under Article 8) (art. 8). In the circumstances, they concluded, the applicants had no actionable claim to a civil right under English law so as to attract the application of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\nThe Commission and the applicants, on the other hand, considered that the defence amounted to a limitation on the right to bring defamation proceedings and, as such, a restriction on effective access to court.\r\n67.   It is not always an easy matter to trace the dividing line between procedural and substantive limitations of a given entitlement under domestic law. It may sometimes be no more than a question of legislative technique whether the limitation is expressed in terms of the right or its remedy.\r\nIn the present case the Court does not consider it necessary to settle the question of the precise nature of the defence of privilege for the purposes of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), since it is devoid of significance in the particular circumstances. If the Court were to treat the facts underlying the complaints declared admissible by the Commission as raising a substantive, rather than a procedural, complaint going to the right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention - as it has jurisdiction to do (see the Handyside v. the United Kingdom judgment of 7 December 1976, Series A no. 24, pp. 19-20, para. 41) -, the same central issues of legitimate aim and proportionality as under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) would be posed.\r\nThe Court therefore proposes to proceed on the basis that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable to the facts of the case, the argument before the Court having been directed solely to this Article.\r\n68.   On this approach, it has to be ascertained whether the contested limitation on the applicants’ ability to take legal proceedings to challenge the findings and conclusions in the Inspectors’ report which were damaging to their reputations satisfied the conditions stated in the Court’s case-law.\r\n3. Legitimacy of the aims pursued by the contested limitation\r\n69.   The legitimacy of the limitation complained of cannot be divorced from its context, namely the system of investigation and reporting under the Companies Act 1985.\r\nThe underlying aim of this system is clearly the furtherance of the public interest in the proper conduct of the affairs of public companies whose owners benefit from limited liability. Considerations of public interest dictate both the appointment of Inspectors and the publication or not of their report (see paragraphs 36, 40 and 41 above). The system contributes to safeguarding the interests of the various parties concerned in the affairs of public companies such as investors, shareholders, especially small shareholders, creditors, customers, trading partners and employees, as well as ensuring the overall soundness and credibility of the country’s company law structures. In the words of the Commission’s report (at paragraph 64), \"it is ... necessary in a democratic society that governments exercise supervisory controls over large commercial activities in order to ensure good management practices and the transparency of honest dealings\".\r\nAs regards the particular facts complained of by the applicant brothers, the Court accepts as accurate the Government’s analysis of the purposes served by the making and publication of the Inspectors’ report (see paragraphs 28 and 58 above - see also paragraphs 13, 14 and 30 above as regards the particular facts).\r\nThe investigation into the affairs of HOFH and the publication of the resultant report in themselves therefore pursued legitimate aims.\r\n70.   As to the contested limitation on the ability to take legal proceedings, it was common ground that any defamation action brought by the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State would have been successfully met with a defence of privilege, be it absolute or qualified (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). The rationale of this defence is that statements which harm an individual’s reputation and which would otherwise give rise to liability should benefit from total or partial immunity because their author or publisher is acting in furtherance of some overriding interest of social importance (see paragraph 42 above). As regards more specifically investigations under the Companies Act, the British courts have explained that \"the public interest demands\" that \"Inspectors should make their report with courage and frankness\" (per Lord Denning in re Pergamon Press Ltd - see paragraph 43 above).\r\nLike the Commission, the Court has no difficulty in accepting that the underlying objective in according Inspectors freedom to report in this manner is likewise legitimate.\r\n4. Proportionality of the means employed\r\n71.   It remains to be determined whether in the circumstances of the particular case there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate objectives pursued by the contested limitation.\r\n72.   Before the Court the applicants appeared to shift the emphasis of their argument as compared with their submissions to the Commission. Whilst continuing to maintain that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued, they stressed that their complaint was not directed against the defence of privilege as such. They were not asserting a right to hold the Inspectors or the Secretary of State personally liable for damages in a suit for defamation; nor were they arguing that such independent reports into the affairs of public companies should never be prepared or published. Rather their claim was that where a report by organs of the State has branded an individual as being guilty of wrongdoing such as dishonesty after a procedure not attended by the procedural guarantees of a fair trial, Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) grants the individual whose reputation is at stake the right to challenge the findings against him or her in a court of law before publication of the report. Accepting that a cause of action based on libel was barred and that judicial review did not provide the desired remedy, some other form of effective access to the courts should have been available to them for this purpose by virtue of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\nThe English legal system, in their view, lacked adequate safeguards to protect their civil right to honour and reputation against misuse of their powers by the Inspectors and the Secretary of State. They submitted that means which involved denying them any effective remedy at all for the attack on their reputations caused disproportionate harm to them. They suggested that the requisite fair balance between the competing interests would be secured by the Government adopting a system which satisfied the aim pursued in a manner less harmful to their human rights, such as publication of the report only following full judicial scrutiny of the Inspectors’ findings of fact.\r\n73.   In its report, the Commission expressed the opinion that the principle of proportionality had not been transgressed in the applicants’ case. In its view, judicial review, whilst not affording complete protection against possibly erroneous conclusions by the Inspectors, did \"provide sufficient guarantees for persons affected by the report, which [were] proportionate to the general public interest in inquiries of the present kind\" (paragraph 75 of the report).\r\n74.   In so far as the defence of privilege was taken to be a procedural bar on access, the Government agreed with the Commission’s analysis. As they perceived it, the applicants’ claim was really based on the impracticable proposition that a person aggrieved at any conclusion of fact reached by Inspectors acting under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 because of some detrimental effect on his or her reputation ought, by virtue of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), to have a right of appeal to a court to challenge that conclusion.\r\n75.   The Court recognises that limitations on access to court may be more extensive when regulation of activities in the public sphere is at stake than in relation to litigation over the conduct of persons acting in their private capacity. As to enforcement of the right to a good reputation under domestic law, the limits of acceptable criticism are wider with regard to businessmen actively involved in the affairs of large public companies than with regard to private individuals, to paraphrase a principle enunciated by the Court in the context of the State’s power to restrict freedom of expression in accordance with Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) of the Convention (see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 26, para. 59). Persons, such as the applicants, who fall into the former category of businessmen inevitably and knowingly lay themselves open to close scrutiny of their acts, not only by the press but also and above all by bodies representing the public interest (ibid.).\r\n76.   An additional point to note as concerns the particular circumstances of the present case is that the findings in the Inspectors’ report to which the applicants took exception related to matters which the applicants themselves had made great efforts to bring into the public domain, namely their family background, their personal wealth and their business activities (see paragraphs 9 and 22 above). The beneficial public reputation which the applicants enjoyed in late 1984 and early 1985 was largely the result of an active public relations campaign which they undertook with the assistance of their advisers, and it played a crucial role in facilitating clearance of their bid for HOF. Thereafter the applicants were at pains to stifle any publicity adverse to this favourable reputation which they had themselves largely created, as is shown by their threatened or actual libel actions against various newspapers, notably The Observer (see paragraph 11 above). The contested limitation was thus concerned with an investigation of circumstances offered to public scrutiny by persons who had themselves sought a public profile through their bid to take over a large public company.\r\n77.   Like the Commission, the Court does not find it decisive whether the Inspectors’ report benefited from absolute or merely qualified privilege (see paragraphs 42 and 43 above). In any event, in their argument to the Court the applicants did not suggest that either the Inspectors or the successive Secretaries of State had acted with malicious intent, which would have destroyed a defence of qualified privilege.\r\n78.   In arriving at their findings of fact or conclusions, the Inspectors were under a duty to act fairly and to give anyone whom they proposed to criticise in their report a fair opportunity to answer the allegations against them. Although the investigation was administrative and not judicial in nature, the Inspectors were bound by what are known under English law as \"the rules of natural justice\" (see paragraph 39 above). The remedy of judicial review was available to the applicants against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State to challenge the appointment of the Inspectors, the making of the report, its content or its publication if it could be claimed that there had been unfairness or breach of the rules of natural justice or that the findings or conclusions were unreliable on a number of other grounds (see paragraphs 44 and 45 above). In the latter connection, judicial review would have provided relief if it could have been established that the Inspectors had made findings of fact not properly based on material with probative value, or reached conclusions which there were no facts to support, or taken into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take account of relevant considerations, or reached conclusions which no reasonable person in their position could have reached (ibid.).\r\nJudicial review would not, it is true, have provided the applicants with \"the effective remedy\" to which they were claiming to be entitled under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), namely a remedy enabling them to argue before a court that the Inspectors’ findings of fact were simply erroneous. Nonetheless, the manner in which findings detrimental to a person’s reputation are arrived at in an administrative investigation, as well as the objectives pursued by the investigation, is relevant for assessing the permissibility under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of a limitation on the person’s opportunities to go to court to enforce his or her civil right to reputation.\r\nWhilst Inspectors are accorded broad freedom in reporting on the affairs of public companies, the performance of their investigative functions is attended by not inconsiderable safeguards intended to ensure a fair procedure and the reliability of findings of fact.\r\n79.   Extremely serious accusations were levelled against the Inspectors by the applicants in the press release issued by them on the day of the publication of the Inspectors’ report, including accusations of dishonesty, prejudice, non-respect of agreed procedures, unfairness and total disregard of the principles of natural justice (see paragraph 32 above). In correspondence with the authorities the applicants had previously been consistently threatening to take legal action to contest the report and its publication; yet in the event they did not do so, despite a formal undertaking on behalf of the Secretary of State to hold up publication if proceedings were brought (see paragraph 29 above). As the Government pointed out, a reading of the Inspectors’ report shows that the applicants were made aware of the information required of them and were given every reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them and to furnish evidence, notwithstanding their last-minute procedural request to the Inspectors (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above). Safeguards afforded to the applicants throughout the investigation included constant consultation by the Inspectors as regards the structure, procedure and lines of inquiry of the investigation, the professional representation of the applicants, at interviews as well as in the submission of evidence and argument, and the Inspectors’ concern to respect the applicants’ personal privacy as much as possible (see paragraphs 15 to 18 and 20 above).\r\n80.   The applicants pointed out that the Inspectors’ report containing findings of dishonesty was published, with the benefit of protection from liability in defamation, even though the authorities decided that there was no cause for instituting either criminal or civil proceedings (see paragraphs 23, 27, 28 and 30 above). The Court has also taken note of the evidence submitted by the applicants showing that there is a body of informed opinion in the United Kingdom which believes that these consequences of the system enacted by Parliament in the Companies Act 1985 are not desirable.\r\n81.   It is not, however, for the Court to substitute its own view for that of the national legislature as to what would be the most appropriate policy in this regard. The risk of some uncompensated damage to reputation is inevitable if independent investigators in circumstances such as those of the present case are to have the necessary freedom to report without fear, not only to the authorities but also in the final resort to the public. It is in the first place for the national authorities to determine the extent to which the individual’s interest in full protection of his or her reputation should yield to the requirements of the community’s interest in independent investigation of the affairs of large public companies. The applicants’ argument would amount to reading into Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) an entitlement to have a report such as the one in the present case not published until after a full judicial hearing repeating, doubtless over a longer time-scale, the same fact-finding exercise as that already carried out by the Inspectors. Such an entitlement could effectively destroy the utility of informing the public of the results of the administrative investigations provided for under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985. Having found the aim of not only making but also publishing Inspectors’ reports to be legitimate, the Court cannot apply the test of proportionality in such a way as to render publication impracticable.\r\n82.   In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Court cannot find that, in the exercise of their responsibility of regulating the conduct of the affairs of public companies, the national authorities exceeded their margin of appreciation to limit the applicant brothers’ access to the courts under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), either as regards the state of the applicable law or as regards the effects of the application of that law to the brothers. Having regard in particular to the safeguards that did exist in relation to the impugned investigation, the Court concludes that a reasonable relationship of proportionality can be said to have existed between the freedom of reporting accorded to the Inspectors and the legitimate aim pursued in the public interest.\r\n5. Conclusion\r\n83.   In the Court’s view, the limitation on the applicants’ opportunity, before and after publication of the Inspectors’ report, to take legal proceedings to challenge the Inspectors’ findings damaging to their reputations did not involve an unjustified denial of their \"right to a court\" under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\nC. Proceedings against others\r\n84.   A further issue addressed in the Commission’s report was whether the publication of the Inspectors’ report rendered impossible a fair and unbiased trial of the libel actions brought by the applicants against The Observer newspaper (see paragraphs 13 and 34 above), such that they were thereby denied effective access to court for the determination of a dispute over their civil right to honour and reputation.\r\nThis complaint was not pursued by the applicants in their pleadings before the Court, and the Court sees no cause, in law or on the facts, to examine it of its own motion.\r\nD. Recapitulation\r\n85.   The Court finds no violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) in the present case under any of the heads of complaint.\r\nIII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 (art. 13)\r\n86.   Before the Commission the applicants alleged that, contrary to Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention, no effective remedy was available under English law in respect of their complaint of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention. Article 13 (art. 13) provides:\r\n\"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\"\r\n87.   The Commission concluded in its report that no separate issue arose under Article 13 (art. 13). In their memorial to the Court, the applicants announced that they would not be seeking to contest the Commission’s conclusion.\r\n88.   In view of the applicants’ effective withdrawal of this complaint, the Court does not find it necessary also to examine the case under Article 13 (art. 13).\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.    Dismisses the Government’s preliminary objection;\r\n\r\n2.    Holds that there has been no breach of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention;\r\n\r\n3.    Holds that it is not necessary also to examine the case under Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention.\r\n\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 September 1994.\r\n\r\nRolv RYSSDAL\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nActing Registrar\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of the Rules of Court, the concurring opinion of Mr Martens is annexed to this judgment.\r\n\r\nR. R.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS\r\n1.    The applicants submitted that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) was violated because the defence of privilege amounted to a restriction on their right of access to court with respect to the statements in the Inspectors’ report which were damaging to their reputation (paragraph 64 of the Court’s judgment).\r\n2.    The Government denied the applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) since in their opinion the applicants had no actionable claim to a civil right under English law (paragraph 66).\r\n3.    The outcome of the Court’s reasoning in paragraphs 65-67 of its judgment is that the Court \"proposes to proceed on the basis that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is applicable to the facts of the case\". I support that modus procedendi, although I find it difficult to subscribe to the reasoning which led to it.\r\n4.    The starting-point for the Court’s reasoning is its doctrine that Article 6 (art. 6) \"extends only to ‘contestations’ (disputes) over (civil) ‘rights and obligations’ which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law\" (paragraph 65).\r\n5.    In my concurring opinion in the case of Salerno v. Italy (judgment of 12 October 1992, Series A no. 245-D, pp. 57 et seq.), I examined the genesis of this doctrine. In paragraph 3.4 of that opinion I recalled that the doctrine had been fundamentally criticised on repeated occasions by several judges , but I left open whether I too subscribed to that criticism. I came to the conclusion that in any event there was no room for the \"arguable claim\" test where the applicant has in fact had access to a court which has decided on the merits of his claim: a decision on a non-arguable claim should also meet the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).\r\n6.    The present case demonstrates that also within the context of an access-to-court issue the \"arguable claim\" test is an unfortunate feature of the Court’s case-law . It has obliged the Court to adopt a reasoning whose subtleness, to my mind, seems hardly convincing. Nor clear, for what does it mean to say that \"Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) may have a degree of applicability\" and in what cases will this extraordinary phenomenon occur? When does the answer to the question whether a person has an actionable domestic claim depend not only on the substantive content of the relevant right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars?\r\n7.    In my opinion the Court’s reasoning would have been simpler and more persuasive without all this meandering necessitated by its maintaining the \"arguable claim\" test: there could be no doubt as to the applicants’ right to reputation having been damaged. Whether or not a right to reputation is enshrined in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is immaterial, since such a right does exist, at least in principle, under all our national laws and it has not been contended that in this respect English law makes an exception by clearly and fully excluding such a right. Neither can there be doubt as to the right to reputation being a \"civil\" right within the autonomous meaning of that notion under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1). It follows that under this provision, whenever a person’s reputation has been interfered with, he or she is in principle entitled to access to a court meeting its requirements. Consequently, the question whether under English law the defence of privilege constitutes a substantive limitation on the content of the right to reputation or a procedural barrier to access to court is immaterial. On this approach the Court could have gone into the essential question whether the contested limitation was justified under the conditions stated in its case-law (paragraph 68) almost immediately.\r\n\r\n",

AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n\r\n(Application no. 50064/99)\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n\r\n11 December 2003\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL\r\n\r\n\r\n11/03/2004\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision. \r\nIn the case of Girardi v. Austria,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Third Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\r\n\tMr\tG. RESS, President,\r\n\tMr\tL. CAFLISH,\r\n\tMr\tP. KŪRIS,\r\n\tMr\tR. TÜRMEN,\r\n\tMr\tJ. HEDIGAN,\r\n\tMrs\tH.S. GREVE\r\n\tMrs\tE. STEINER, judges,\r\nand Mr V. BERGER, Section Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 20 November 2003,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.  The case originated in an application (no. 50064/99) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by an Austrian national, Elisabeth Girardi (“the applicant”), on 9 July 1999. \r\n2.  The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Mautner-Markhof.\r\n3.  On 4 July 2002 the Third Section declared the application partly inadmissible and decided to communicate the complaint concerning the length of the proceedings to the Government. Under the provisions of Article 29 § 3 of the Convention, it decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility.\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n4.  The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Vienna. \r\nShe is the mother of M, L and R, born in wedlock in 1973, 1974 and 1976, respectively. The spouses separated in 1982. Custody of L and M was assigned to the applicant, the custody of R to the father.\r\n5.  In December 1989 M was admitted in a public girls' home as she refused to stay with her mother. She stayed there until January 1992. From December 1989 until September 1995 custody proceedings concerning the temporary transfer of M's custody to the Vienna Youth Welfare Office for the time M had spent at the girls' home were pending before the Austrian courts.\r\nA. The Youth Welfare Office's request for reimbursement of expenses\r\n6.  On 3 January 1990 the Vienna Youth Welfare Office, on behalf of M, filed a request with the Floridsdorf District Court that the applicant should pay a monthly contribution to the expenses incurred for M's stay in the girls' home. \r\n7.  The file was later on transferred to the competent Juvenile Court and, in January 1990, the court heard M's parents.\r\n8.  On 8 March 1991 the Youth Welfare Office reduced the amount of the requested monthly contribution. \r\n9.  On 10 April 1991 the President of the Juvenile Court granted the applicant's motion for bias against the competent court clerk (Rechtspfleger).\r\n10.  A hearing scheduled for 25 July 1991 was cancelled due to the applicant's illness. Further hearings scheduled for 2 September 1991 and 11 September 1991 had to be cancelled because the court's attempts to deliver the summons to the applicant were unsuccessful. \r\n11.  On 10 February 1992 the Juvenile Court ordered that the applicant had to pay ATS 2,500 in monthly maintenance for M. The applicant appealed, claiming that she was fit to work to an extent of 75% only.\r\n12.  On 4 March 1992 the case was assigned to another judge as the competent judge had declared himself biased.\r\n13.  On 13 May 1992 the Appeal Chamber quashed the decision and remitted the case back to the Juvenile Court, instructing the latter to take a new decision after having supplemented its proceedings. In particular, it stated that the first instance court ought to appoint a forensic medical expert in order to establish the applicant's fitness to work.\r\n14.  On 20 May 1998 the Juvenile Court ordered the applicant to pay ATS 1,550 in monthly maintenance for M. At that stage of the proceedings, no expert had been heard yet.\r\n15.  Referring to the Appeal Chamber's decision of 13 May 1992, the applicant appealed, again relying on her reduced fitness to work.\r\n16.  On 13 August 1998 the Juvenile Court appointed an expert in forensic medicine to file a report on the question as to which extent the applicant's capacities to earn her living were reduced.\r\n17.  The applicant appealed against this decision, claiming that it no longer made sense to appoint a medical expert, now that the court had already dismissed her request by a decision of 20 May 1998. Further, she claimed that there was no need for a further report as, in this respect, she had already submitted two reports of different medical officers (Amtsarzt).\r\n18.  On 17 and 20 August 1998 the applicant filed motions for bias against the court clerk (Rechtspfleger) I.S., who was dealing with her case, claiming that the appointment of a further medical expert was not justified, that I.S. was handling the case file in a negligent manner, namely that several documents were missing from the file, and that I.S. had been rude to her on the telephone.\r\n19.  On 25 August 1998 the President of the Vienna Juvenile Court (Präsident des Jugendgerichtshofs) dismissed her motion for bias, finding that the mere fact that she had appointed a medical expert was not sufficient to cast doubt upon I.S.' impartiality. He also noted that there were no documents missing from the file.\r\n20.  On 17 September 1998 the Appeal Chamber dismissed the applicant's appeal against the appointment of a medical expert, but granted her appeal against the decision of 20 May 1998. In this respect, it referred the case to the Juvenile Court for supplementing the taking of evidence, namely to comply with its decision of 13 May 1992.\r\n21.  On 21 and 23 March 1999 the applicant requested that, pursuant to Section 91 of the Courts Act (Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz), a time-limit be fixed for the decision on the Youth Welfare Office's application of 3 January 1990.\r\n22.  On 23 March 1999 the applicant filed a motion for bias against I.S., claiming that the latter had not been available to her during office hours and that she had refused to give her information requested over the telephone.\r\n23.  On 29 March 1999 the President of the Vienna Juvenile Court dismissed her motion as being unfounded.\r\n24.  On 30 March 1999 the President rejected her appeal against this decision, as the relevant provisions of the Court Clerks Act (Rechtspflegergesetz) did not provide for such remedy.\r\n25.  On 8 April 1999 the applicant was summoned by the appointed medical expert to undergo a medical examination at the Institute for Forensic Medicine (Institut für Gerichtsmedizin) on 22 April 1999.\r\n26.  It appears that the applicant filed numerous complaints with the President of the Juvenile Court, again claiming that documents were missing from the file and that I.S. as well as various judges of the Juvenile Court were biased.\r\n27.  On 4 May 1999 the President of the Juvenile Court decided to exclude I.S. from the proceedings. He noted that the latter had expressed that she considered herself biased following a telephone conversation in the course of which the applicant had said she would kill her daughter if I.S. continued to harass her. In these circumstances, the President found it advisable that the matter be re-assigned in accordance with the Juvenile Court's rules on the distribution of cases (Geschäftsverteilung).\r\n28.  On the same day, the Juvenile Court dismissed the applicant's requests for a time-limit to be set. Referring to the applicant's numerous requests, complaints and motions for bias filed with the court, it found that there was no indication of a lack of due diligence on behalf of the Juvenile Court, it being rather the applicant who prevented that a decision on the merits had been taken so far.\r\n29.  On 17 May 1999 the Vienna Youth Welfare Office withdrew its request dated of 3 January 1990.\r\n30.  Thereupon, the applicant, on 27 May 1999, withdrew all requests and complaints still pending before the Juvenile Court at that stage.\r\nB. The applicant's request for reimbursement of expenses\r\n31.  From 30 July 1990 to 3 September 1990 M stayed with her mother. The latter, on 4 September 1990 filed a request with the Juvenile Court, claiming reimbursement of her expenses incurred during this period.\r\n32.  In September 1990 the Vienna Youth Welfare Office reimbursed the applicant for M's stay with her from 30 July 1990 to 21 August 1990.\r\n33.  On 10 August 1993 the Juvenile Court dismissed the applicant's request for expenses incurred during the rest of the period.\r\n34.  On 30 August 1993 the President of the Vienna Juvenile Court dismissed the applicant's motion of bias against the competent judge. On 30 December 1993 the Vienna Court of Appeal granted the applicant's appeal against this decision and quashed the decision. \r\n35.  On 20 January 1994 the Appeal Chamber of the Juvenile Court again dismissed the applicant's motion for bias. On 6 May 1994 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal. A further appeal to the Supreme Court was to no avail. A further motion for bias against the President of the Juvenile Court was to no avail either. \r\n36.  On 5 January 1995 the Appeal Chamber quashed the decision of 10 August 1993 and remitted the case back to the first instance court. \r\n37.  On 19 April 1998 the applicant requested that, pursuant to Section 91 of the Courts Act, a time-limit be fixed for the decision on her application of 4 September 1990.\r\n38.  On 8 June 1998 the President of the Vienna Juvenile Court ordered the Juvenile Court to decide on the applicant's request no later than on 31 July 1998.\r\n39.  On 5 August 1998 the Juvenile Court dismissed the applicant's request for maintenance payments of 4 September 1990.\r\n40.  The applicant appealed against this decision.\r\n41.  It appears from the documents submitted that the applicant filed several complaints with the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht), claiming that I.S. had not complied with the time limit set by the President of the Juvenile Court because she had gone on holidays, that the competent judicial officer, I.S. was to be found at her office only twice a week and that she had been extraordinarily impolite to her.\r\n42.  Thereupon, the President of the Juvenile Court, on 31 August 1998, informed the applicant that both I.S.'s office hours as well as her right to vacation were in accordance with her assignment. He also expressed his regret that, if, in the course of one of the applicant's numerous telephone calls, I.S. might have acted in a slightly indignant way. However, he emphasised that the applicant's allegations had remained unproved.\r\n43.  On 17 September 1998 the Appeal Chamber dismissed her appeal against the Juvenile Court's decision of 5 August 1998 as being unfounded. Further, it stated that there was no further appeal on points of law in the applicant's case as it did not raise questions of law of fundamental importance (Ausspruch über die Unzulässigkeit der ordentlichen Revision). \r\n44.  Nevertheless, the applicant filed an extraordinary appeal on points of law (ausserordentliche Revision) with the Supreme Court.\r\n45.  Referring to an amendment of Section 14 a of the Non-Contentious Proceedings Act (Ausserstreitgesetz), the Supreme Court on 18 December 1998 remitted the case back to the Vienna Juvenile Appeal Court. According to that provision, instead of filing an extraordinary appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court, a party to non-contentious proceedings must now request the Court of Appeal to re-consider its opinion on the admissibility of an ordinary appeal on points of law. The Supreme Court found that, even if in her appeal the applicant had not explicitly requested the Juvenile Appeal Court to declare that a further appeal on points of law be allowed, her appeal should have been understood in such a way. \r\n46.  Thereupon, on 11 January 1999 the Juvenile Appeal Court requested the applicant to remedy procedural defects of her appeal, namely to request that an ordinary appeal in her case be allowed.\r\n47.  As the applicant did not comply with this request, the Juvenile Appeal Court, on 25 February 1999, rejected her appeal.\r\nTHE LAW\r\nI.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n48.  The applicant complained that the length of the maintenance payment proceedings had been incompatible with the “reasonable time” principle as provided in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:\r\nIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations......, everyone is entitled to a fair...hearing within reasonable time... by[a]... tribunal”\r\n49.  As regards the first set of proceedings, the period to be taken into consideration began on 3 January 1990 and ended on 22 May 1999. Thus, they lasted more than nine years and four months. \r\n50.  As regards the second set of proceedings, the period to be taken into consideration began on 4 September 1990 and ended on 25 February 1999. Thus, they lasted for more than eight years and five months.\r\nA.  Admissibility\r\n51.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.\r\nB.  Merits\r\n52.  The Government submitted that the maintenance proceedings were complex. In particular, they had to be seen as a part of highly complex custody proceedings which required extensive expert opinions. While the authorities tried to conduct the proceedings expeditiously, the applicant filed a multitude of motions of bias, appeals and requests for extension of time-limits and therefore herself contributed considerably to the length of the proceedings. The Government further stressed that the applicant repeatedly thwarted attempts to deliver summons on her and failed to obey them. \r\n53.  The applicant did not submit any observations on these issues.\r\n54.  The Court reiterates that the reasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the criteria established by its case-law, particularly the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities and what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Frydlender v. France [GC], no. 30979/96, § 43, ECHR 2000-VII).\r\n55.  The Court considers that the present proceedings can clearly be distinguished from the custody proceedings, as they concerned merely the fixing of maintenance payments and were not particularly complex. \r\n56.  As regards the conduct of the applicant the Court has consistently held that applicants cannot be blamed for making full use of the remedies available to them under domestic law. However, an applicant's behaviour constitutes an objective fact which cannot be attributed to the respondent State and which must be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether or not the reasonable time referred to in Article 6 § 1 has been exceeded (see Erkner and Hofbauer v. Austria, no. 9616/81, Commission decision of 23 April 1987, A 117, § 68) \r\n57.  In the present case, the Court acknowledges that the applicant had filed numerous requests, complaints and motions and had repeatedly failed to obey the authorities' summons. Although such conduct contributed to prolonging the proceedings, it is not in itself sufficient to explain the length of the extensive proceedings. \r\n58.  On the other hand, the Court notes that there are substantial delays attributable to the authorities. In particular, in the first set of proceedings, there is a period of inactivity of more than two years (from 3 January 1990 to 10 February 1992) while the case was pending before the Vienna Juvenile Court, and a further one of six years (from 13 May 1992 to 20 May 1998) before that court took a new decision after the first one had been quashed on appeal. In the second set of proceedings, there is a period of inactivity of some three years (from 4 September 1990 to 10 August 1993), while the case was pending before the Vienna Juvenile Court, and a further such period of three years and seven months (from 5 January 1995 to 5 August 1998) before that court took a new decision after the first one had been quashed on appeal. The Court cannot find that the Government has given sufficient explanation for these delays that occurred.\r\n59.  The Court therefore finds that the overall length of the proceedings cannot be regarded as “reasonable”. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. \r\n\r\nII. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n60.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:\r\n“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”\r\n61.  The applicant has not filed a claim for just satisfaction. Accordingly, the Court considers that no award can be made under this provision.\r\n \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.  Declares the application admissible;\r\n\r\n2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;\r\n\r\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 11 December 2003, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\r\nVincent BERGER\tGeorg RESS\r\n\tRegistrar\tPresident\r\n",

AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n(Application no. 15963/90)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n23 Octobre 1995 \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the case of Gradinger v. Austria  , \r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A  , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tF. MATSCHER, \r\n\tMr \tL.-E. PETTITI, \r\n\tMr \tR. MACDONALD, \r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS, \r\n\tMr \tI. FOIGHEL, \r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA, \r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND, \r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK, \r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, \r\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 April and 28 September 1995, \r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: \r\nPROCEDURE  \r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 9 September 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 15963/90) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by an Austrian national, Mr Josef Gradinger, on 22 May 1989.\r\nThe Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention and Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (art. 6-1, P7-4).  \r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).  The President of the Court gave the lawyer leave to use the German language during the written proceedings (Rule 27 para. 3).  \r\n3.   On 24 September 1994 the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider the instant case and the cases of Schmautzer, Umlauft, Pramstaller, Palaoro and Pfarrmeier v. Austria  . \r\nThe Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Mr F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L. E. Pettiti, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Sir John Freeland and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).  \r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Austrian Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant's lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).  Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's memorial on 24 January 1995 and the applicant's memorial on 30 January 1995.  Mr Gradinger's claims under Article 50 (art. 50) were filed on 14 March.  On 21 March the Commission supplied the Registrar with various documents that he had requested on the President's instructions.  \r\n5.   In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 April 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:  \r\n(a) for the Government  \r\n\t\tMr F. CEDE, Head of the International Law \r\n\t\t\tDepartment, Federal Ministry of\r\n\t\t\tForeign Affairs,\tAgent,\r\n\t\tMs I. SIEß, Constitutional Department,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Chancellery, \r\n\t\tMs E. BERTAGNOLI, International Law Department,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission  \r\n\t\tMr A. WEITZEL,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant  \r\n\t\tMr R. FIEBINGER, Rechtsanwalt,\tCounsel.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Weitzel, Mr Fiebinger and Mr Cede.  \r\nAS TO THE FACTS  \r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE  \r\n6.   Mr Gradinger is an Austrian citizen who lives at St Pölten (Lower Austria).  \r\n7.   On 1 January 1987 at about 4 a.m., while driving his car, he caused an accident which led to the death of a cyclist.\r\nAt the hospital where he was taken for treatment a specimen of his blood was taken.  This showed that he then had a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre.  \r\n8.   On 15 May 1987 the St Pölten Regional Court (Landesgericht) convicted him of causing death by negligence (fahrlässige Tötung) and sentenced him to 200 day-fines of 160 Austrian schillings (ATS) with 100 days' imprisonment in default of payment (Article 80 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) - see paragraph 13 below).\r\nAccording to the applicant, an expert, Dr Psick, had stated at his trial that in view of the shortness of the interval between the last drink the applicant had had and the collision, he could not have absorbed an amount of alcohol exceeding the prescribed limit.\r\nIn the judgment, as set out in the court record (Protokolls- und Urteilsvermerk), it was held that the applicant had indeed been drinking before the accident but not to such an extent as to be caught by Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, which prescribed a heavier penalty for causing death by negligence while under the influence of drink (see paragraph 14 below).  \r\n9.   On 16 July 1987 the St Pölten district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) issued a \"sentence order\" (Straferkenntnis) imposing on Mr Gradinger a fine of ATS 12,000, with two weeks' imprisonment in default, for driving under the influence of drink.  It made this order pursuant to sections 5(1) and 99(1)(a) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (Straßenverkehrsordnung - see paragraphs 15 and 16 below) and on the basis of a different medical report, of 5 February 1987, according to which, in view of the time that had elapsed between the collision and the taking of the blood specimen, Mr Gradinger's blood alcohol level when the accident had occurred must have been at least 0.95 grams per litre.  \r\n10.   The applicant appealed to the Lower Austria regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), which dismissed his appeal on 27 July 1988 on the basis of a further expert opinion, of 16 June 1988, to the effect that the blood alcohol level had been 0.9 grams per litre.  \r\n11.   On 11 October 1988 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) declined to accept for adjudication an appeal by the applicant, on the ground that it did not have sufficient prospects of success.  \r\n12.   A further appeal, to the Administrative Court, was dismissed as ill-founded on 29 March 1989.  It was held that the regional authorities had not in any way misconstrued the law in finding that at the material time Mr Gradinger had been under the influence of drink for the purposes of section 5(1) of the Road Traffic Act.  That finding had been based on an expert opinion of 16 June 1988 in which it had been assumed that all the alcohol consumed by the applicant had passed into his bloodstream by the time of the accident, a point which Mr Gradinger had not contested.  He was therefore wrong in asserting that the expert report had not analysed the effects of the last drink he had had before the accident.\r\nFurthermore, the authorities had acted in accordance with the law in appointing an official expert (Amtssachverständiger) rather than a sworn court expert (gerichtlich beeideter Sachverständiger) to report on Mr Gradinger's blood alcohol level.  In the case under consideration there had been no special factor to justify their doing otherwise. Nor, contrary to the applicant's assertions, had they appointed as expert the person already called upon at first instance by the district authority (see paragraph 9 above).\r\nAs for Article 14 para. 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, embodying the \"non bis in idem\" principle, this was not directly applicable in the Austrian legal system.  Accordingly, the authorities had not misconstrued the law by punishing the applicant after a criminal court had acquitted him (see paragraph 8 above).  \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW  \r\nA. Substantive law  \r\n1. The Criminal Code  \r\n13.   By Article 80 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch):  \r\n\"It shall be an offence, punishable with up to one year's imprisonment, for any person to cause the death of another by negligence.\"  \r\n14.   Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code provides:  \r\n\"It shall be an offence, punishable with up to three years' imprisonment, for any person to cause the death of another by negligence  \r\n1.   ...  \r\n2.   after allowing himself, even if only negligently, to become intoxicated ... through the consumption of alcohol, but not to an extent which excludes his responsibility, notwithstanding that he has foreseen or could have foreseen that he would shortly have to engage in an activity likely to pose ... a danger to the lives ... of others if performed in that state.\"  \r\nUnder an irrebuttable presumption applied by the criminal courts, a driver with a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher is deemed to be \"intoxicated\" for the purposes of Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code (Foregger/Serini, Kurzkommentar zum Strafgesetzbuch, 4th edition, 1988, p. 217).  \r\n2. The Road Traffic Act  \r\n15.   Under section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 it is an offence for any person to drive a vehicle if the proportion of alcohol in his blood or breath is equal to or higher than 0.8 grams per litre or 0.4 milligrams per litre respectively.  The same section also lays down the conditions for the use of breathalysers and blood tests.  \r\n16.   Since 1 May 1986 section 99(1)(a) of the Act has provided:  \r\n\"It shall be an administrative offence (Verwaltungsübertretung), punishable with a fine of not less than 8,000 and not more than 50,000 schillings or, in default of payment, with one to six weeks' imprisonment, for any person:  \r\n(a) to drive ... a vehicle when under the influence of drink ...\"  \r\n17.   In 1958, at the time when the Austrian Government ratified the Convention (see paragraph 28 below), section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (Straßenpolizeigesetz) provided: \"Every driver shall be under a duty to pay reasonable heed to other road users and to display the care and diligence necessary to ensure the maintenance of order, safety and a proper flow of traffic.\"  \r\nB. Procedure  \r\n18.   Article 90 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) provides:  \r\n\"Hearings by trial courts in civil and criminal cases shall be oral and public.  Exceptions may be prescribed by law.\"  \r\n1. Proceedings in the Constitutional Court  \r\n19.   By Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution the Constitutional Court, when an application (Beschwerde) is made to it, has to determine whether an administrative decision (Bescheid) has infringed a right guaranteed by the Constitution or has applied regulations (Verordnung) contrary to the law, a law contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law.\r\nArticle 144 para. 2 provides:  \r\n\"Up to the time of the hearing the Constitutional Court may by means of a decision (Beschluß) decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it cannot be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law.  The court may not decline to accept for adjudication a case excluded from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court by Article 133.\"  \r\n2. Proceedings in the Administrative Court  \r\n20.   By Article 130 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear, inter alia, applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful.  \r\n21.   Section 35(1) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz) provides:  \r\n\"Applications from whose content it is apparent that the contravention of the law alleged by the applicant has not occurred shall be dismissed, at a private sitting, without further formality.\"  \r\n22.   Section 39(1) provides, in particular, that at the end of the preliminary proceedings (Vorverfahren) the Administrative Court must hold a hearing where the applicant makes a request to that effect.  \r\nSection 39(2) reads as follows:  \r\n\"Notwithstanding a party's application under subsection (1), the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing where  \r\n1.   the proceedings must be stayed (section 33) or the application dismissed (section 34);  \r\n2.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction (section 42(2)(2));  \r\n3.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful on account of a breach of procedural rules (section 42(2)(3));  \r\n4.   the impugned decision must be quashed because its content is unlawful according to the established case-law of the Administrative Court;  \r\n5.   neither the respondent authority nor any other party before the court has filed pleadings in reply and the impugned decision is to be quashed;  \r\n6.   it is apparent to the court from the pleadings of the parties to the proceedings before it and from the files relating to the earlier administrative proceedings that a hearing is not likely to clarify the case further.\"  \r\nSub-paragraphs 1 to 3 of section 39(2) were in force in 1958; sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 were inserted in 1964 and sub-paragraph 6 in 1982.  \r\n23.   Section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides:  \r\n\"In so far as the Administrative Court does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority's lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules (section 42 (2)(2) and (3)) ..., it must examine the impugned decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward ...  If it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on [one of these complaints] ..., it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary.\"  \r\n24.   Section 42(1) of the same Act states that, save as otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision.  \r\nBy section 42(2),  \r\n\"The Administrative Court shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful  \r\n1.   by reason of its content, [or]  \r\n2.   because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction, [or]  \r\n3.   on account of a breach of procedural rules, in that  \r\n(a) the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are, in an important respect, contradicted by the case file, or  \r\n(b) the facts require further investigation on an important point, or  \r\n(c) procedural rules have been disregarded, compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority.\"  \r\n25.   If the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision, \"the administrative authorities [are] under a duty ... to take immediate steps, using the legal means available to them, to bring about in the specific case the legal situation which corresponds to the Administrative Court's view of the law (Rechtsanschauung)\" (section 63(1)).  \r\n26.   In a judgment of 14 October 1987 (G 181/86) the Constitutional Court held:  \r\n\"From the fact that it has been necessary to extend the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention to cover the procedural safeguards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, because of the connection between those two provisions (art. 5, art. 6), it follows that, conversely, the limited review (die (bloß) nachprüfende Kontrolle) carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court is insufficient in respect of criminal penalties within the meaning of the Convention that are not covered by the reservation.\"  \r\n3. The \"independent administrative tribunals\"  \r\n27.   Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution, administrative courts called \"independent administrative tribunals\" (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate) were set up in the Länder with effect from 1 January 1991.  The functions of these tribunals include determining both the factual and the legal issues arising in cases concerning administrative offences (Verwaltungsübertretungen).  \r\nIII.   AUSTRIA'S RESERVATIONS  \r\n28.   The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by the Austrian Government on 3 September 1958 contains, inter alia, a reservation worded as follows:  \r\n\"The provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention shall be so applied that there shall be no interference with the measures for the deprivation of liberty prescribed in the laws on administrative procedure, BGBl [Federal Official Gazette] No. 172/1950, subject to review by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Austrian Federal Constitution.\"  \r\n29.   The instrument of ratification of Protocol No. 7 (P7) deposited by the Austrian Government on 14 May 1986 contains, inter alia, the following declaration:  \r\n\"Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4) exclusively relate to criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure.\"  \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION  \r\n30.   Mr Gradinger applied to the Commission on 22 May 1989.  Relying on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, he complained that he had been convicted, contrary to the \"non bis in idem\" principle, by an administrative authority which, furthermore, could not be considered an \"independent and impartial tribunal\" and had called on the services of its own experts.  At the hearing he also alleged a violation of Article 6 para. 2 (art. 6-2), which enshrined the presumption of innocence.  \r\n31.   On 10 May 1993 the Commission rejected the complaint relating to Article 6 para. 2 (art. 6-2) for failure to comply with the six-month rule (Article 26 read in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 of the Convention) (art. 26+27-3) and declared the remainder of the application (no. 15963/90) admissible.\r\nIn its report of 19 May 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention (right to an independent and impartial tribunal) and Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4); it also expressed the view that no separate issue arose under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) regarding the lack of a hearing in the Administrative Court (unanimously).  The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the concurring opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment  . \r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT  \r\n32.   In their memorial the Government asked the Court  \r\n\"1.   to find that Article 6 (art. 6) is not applicable in the case at issue;  alternatively,  \r\n2.   to find that there was no violation of Article 6 (art. 6) in connection with the administrative criminal proceedings underlying the present application;  \r\n3.   to declare the application in respect of the concerns raised under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) incompatible ratione temporis with the Convention pursuant to Article 27 para. 2 (art. 27-2); or alternatively,  \r\n4.   to find that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) to the Convention was not infringed in the administrative criminal proceedings underlying the application\".  \r\nAS TO THE LAW  \r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n33.   The applicant complained of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ...\"  \r\nHe had, he maintained, been denied the right to a \"tribunal\" and to a hearing before such a body.  \r\nA. Applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n1. Whether there was a \"criminal charge\"  \r\n34.   In Mr Gradinger's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a \"criminal charge\".  This was not disputed by the Government.  \r\n35.   In order to determine whether an offence qualifies as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention, it is first necessary to ascertain whether or not the provision (art. 6-1) defining the offence belongs, in the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next the \"very nature of the offence\" and the degree of severity of the penalty risked must be considered (see, among other authorities, the Öztürk v. Germany judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, p. 18, para. 50, and the Demicoli v. Malta judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, pp. 15-17, paras. 31-34).  \r\n36.   Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.  This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).  In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 16 above).\r\nThese considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that Article 6 (art. 6) applies.\r\n2. Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention  \r\n37.   According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.  There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to \"measures for the deprivation of liberty\" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures. Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison.\r\nAdmittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.  However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.  It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 17 above).  \r\n38.   The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.  In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"1.   Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision (art. 64).  Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  \r\n2.   Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.\"  \r\nSecondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  \r\n39.   The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).  It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions (art. 5, art. 64) applied in the present case are covered by that reservation.  They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.\r\nThe Court notes that Mr Gradinger based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.  Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.  Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied.\r\nThese considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.  \r\nB. Compliance with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n1. Access to a tribunal  \r\n40.   Mr Gradinger contended that none of the bodies that had dealt with his case in the proceedings in issue could be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.  The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above).  It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.  Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.  In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  \r\n41.   The Government contested this view, whereas the Commission accepted it.  \r\n42.   The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  \r\n43.   The Constitutional Court is not such a body.  In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts.  It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  \r\n44.   The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\".  These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.  As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of the Convention.  Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 26 above).  \r\n45.   It follows that the applicant did not have access to a \"tribunal\".  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point.\r\n2. Lack of a hearing and failure to take evidence from witnesses  \r\n46.   Mr Gradinger further criticised the Administrative Court for failing to hold a hearing or take evidence from witnesses.  \r\n47.   Having regard to the conclusion set out in paragraph 45 above, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine these complaints.  \r\nII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 4 OF PROTOCOL No. 7 (P7-4)  \r\n48.   The applicant maintained in addition that, by fining him pursuant to section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, the district authority and the regional government had punished him in respect of facts that were identical with those on the basis of which the Regional Court had decided that he did not have a case to answer under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.  As both these provisions in substance prohibited driving a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, there had been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4), which provides:  \r\n\"1.   No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.  \r\n2.   The provisions (P7-4) of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.  \r\n3.   No derogation from this Article (P7-4) shall be made under Article 15 (art. 15) of the Convention.\"  \r\nA. The reservation in respect of Article 4 (P7-4)  \r\n49.   The Government argued that the provision (P7-4) relied on by the applicant could not be invoked in the instant case because Austria's declaration limited its scope exclusively to \"criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure\" (see paragraph 29 above), thereby excluding administrative or disciplinary proceedings.  \r\n\r\n50.   Like the Commission, the Court considers that the \"declaration\" is to be regarded as a reservation within the meaning of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Belilos v. Switzerland judgment of 29 April 1988, Series A no. 132, p. 24, para. 49).  Indeed, the Government did not dispute this.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to determine whether the declaration satisfies the requirements of that provision (art. 64).  \r\n51.   The Court notes at the outset that there is no \"brief statement\" of the law which is said not to conform to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4).  Admittedly, it can be inferred from the wording of the \"declaration\" that Austria intended all proceedings that were not \"criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian Code of Criminal Procedure\" to be excluded from the scope of Articles 3 and 4 (P7-3, P7-4); the Government rightly drew attention to this. Nevertheless, with a description of this nature, which is not exhaustive, the \"declaration\" does not afford to a sufficient degree \"a guarantee ... that [it] does not go beyond the provisions expressly excluded\" by Austria (see, as the most recent authority, the Chorherr judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 20).  Accordingly, the declaration does not satisfy the requirements of Article 64 para. 2 (art. 64-2).\r\nThis conclusion is a sufficient basis for finding the \"declaration\" invalid, without its being necessary also to examine whether the other requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) were complied with.  \r\nB. Applicability ratione temporis of Article 4 (P7-4)  \r\n52.   The Government contended further that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) was inapplicable ratione temporis.  Under section 1(2) of the Administrative Criminal Justice Act (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz), the sanction imposed depended on the law in force when the offence was committed or when the first-instance decision was delivered, if that was more favourable to the accused. In the present case the relevant dates were respectively 1 January and 16 July 1987, whereas Protocol No. 7 (P7) had not entered into force until 1 November 1988.  The fact that the Administrative Court had given judgment after that date, on 29 March 1989, made no difference, because it too was required to rule on the basis of the law applicable when the offence was committed or when the first-instance decision was delivered.  \r\n53.   Like the Commission, the Court observes that the aim of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) is to prohibit the repetition of criminal proceedings that have been concluded by a final decision. That provision (P7-4) does not therefore apply before new proceedings have been opened.  In the present case, inasmuch as the new proceedings reached their conclusion in a decision later in date than the entry into force of Protocol No. 7 (P7), namely the Administrative Court's judgment of 29 March 1989, the conditions for applicability ratione temporis are satisfied.  \r\nC. Compliance with Article 4 (P7-4)  \r\n54.   In reply to Mr Gradinger's arguments (see paragraph 48 above), which the Commission endorsed in substance, the Government affirmed that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) did not preclude applying the two provisions in issue consecutively.  The latter were different in nature and pursued different aims: whereas Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code punished homicide committed while under the influence of drink, section 5 of the Road Traffic Act punished the mere fact of driving a vehicle while intoxicated.  The former was designed to penalise acts that cause death and threaten public safety, the latter to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.  \r\n55.   The Court notes that, according to the St Pölten Regional Court, the aggravating circumstance referred to in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code, namely a blood alcohol level of 0.8 grams per litre or higher, was not made out with regard to the applicant.  On the other hand, the administrative authorities found, in order to bring the applicant's case within the ambit of section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, that that alcohol level had been attained.  The Court is fully aware that the provisions in question differ not only as regards the designation of the offences but also, more importantly, as regards their nature and purpose.  It further observes that the offence provided for in section 5 of the Road Traffic Act represents only one aspect of the offence punished under Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code.  Nevertheless, both impugned decisions were based on the same conduct.  Accordingly, there has been a breach of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4).  \r\nIII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n56.   Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,  \r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"  \r\n57.   Mr Gradinger claimed the sum of ATS 293,130 for the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings in the national courts and then before the Convention institutions.  \r\n58.   The Government expressed the view that only the proceedings in the Administrative Court - which had given rise to the alleged violations - and those in Strasbourg could be taken into account.  They also contested the quantum of the costs, but they were prepared to reimburse a total of ATS 100,000.  \r\n59.   The Delegate of the Commission left the matter of just satisfaction to the discretion of the Court.  \r\n60.   Making an assessment on an equitable basis, having regard to the information in its possession and its case-law, the Court awards Mr Gradinger ATS 150,000.  \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY  \r\n1.   Holds that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention applies in this case;  \r\n\r\n2.   Holds that there has been a violation of that Article (art. 6-1) as regards access to a court;  \r\n\r\n3.   Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaints based on the lack of a hearing in the Administrative Court and that court's failure to take evidence from witnesses;  \r\n4.   Holds that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) applies in this case;  \r\n\r\n5.   Holds that there has been a violation of that Article (P7-4);  \r\n\r\n6.   Holds that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, the sum of 150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand) Austrian schillings in respect of costs and expenses;  \r\n\r\n7.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.  \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 October 1995.  \r\n\r\n\t\tRolv RYSSDAL \r\n\t\tPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the separate opinion of Mr Martens is annexed to this judgment.  \r\n\r\nR. R. \r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS  \r\n1.   I concur in the Court's finding that Article 6 (art. 6) has been violated, but cannot agree with its reasoning.  \r\n2.   My objections concern paragraph 44 of the judgment, which starts with the statement:  \r\n\"The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.\"  \r\n3.   I will refrain from a structural criticism of this paragraph. I cannot help noting, however, that here again the Court finds it necessary to remark that when it is being assessed whether or not the Administrative Court is to be considered a court that affords the safeguards of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), \"regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court\".  One looks in vain, however, for evidence of this methodological principle being put into practice: there does not follow any analysis of what the applicant argued before the Administrative Court, nor is there any trace of \"regard\" to these arguments in the assessment of the adequacy of the Administrative Court's jurisdiction.  For the rest, I refer to the methodological objections to this \"test\" that I raised in paragraph 18 of my separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria (judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312).  \r\n4.   My main objection to this paragraph is the following.  In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.  One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"criminal\" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"civil\" one.  I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  .  Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument.  This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . \r\n",

Switzerland  ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A  , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. BERNHARDT, President,\r\n\tMr \tF. MATSCHER,\r\n\tMr\t C. RUSSO,\r\n\tMr \tN. VALTICOS,\r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS,\r\n\tMrs \tE. PALM,\r\n\tMr \tM.A. LOPES ROCHA,\r\n\tMr \tL. WILDHABER,\r\n\tMr \tK. JUNGWIERT,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 October 1995 and 22 January 1996,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE \r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 29 May 1995, and by the Government of the Swiss Confederation (\"the Government\") on 26 June 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 23218/94) against Switzerland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Turkish national, Mr Riza Gül, on 31 December 1993.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Switzerland recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Articles 45, 47 and 48 (art. 45, art. 47, art. 48).  The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. \r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule 30).  The Turkish Government, having been informed by the Registrar of their right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 48 (b) of the Convention and Rule 33 para. 3 (b)) (art. 48-b), did not indicate any intention of so doing. \r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr L. Wildhaber, the elected judge of Swiss nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4).  On 8 June 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mr C. Russo, Mr N. Valticos, Mr S.K. Martens, Mrs E. Palm, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha and Mr K. Jungwiert (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). \r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38).  Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the memorials of the applicant and the Government on 3 and 11 August 1995 respectively.  On 4 September 1995 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\r\nOn 25 August 1995 the Commission produced the file on the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions. \r\n5.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 October 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court: \r\n(a) for the Government \r\n\t\tMr O. JACOT-GUILLARMOD, Assistant Director,\r\n\t\t\tHead of the International Affairs Division,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Office of Justice,\tAgent,\r\n\t\tMr F. SCHÜRMANN, Deputy Head of the European\r\n\t\t\tLaw and International Affairs Section,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Office of Justice,\r\n\t\tMrs S. MARCONATO, Legal Officer,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Aliens Office,\tCounsel;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr H. DANELIUS,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\n\t\tMr R. PLENDER QC,\r\n\t\tMr J. WALKER, Fürsprech,\tCounsel.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Danelius, Mr Plender and Mr Jacot-Guillarmod, and the latter’s reply to the question asked by one member of the Court.\r\nOn 25 and 27 October 1995 the Registrar received the Government’s and the applicant’s written replies to that question. \r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\nA. Situation of the applicant and part of his family in Switzerland \r\n6.   Mr Gül is a Turkish national, who was born in 1947 and now lives with his wife at Pratteln in the canton of Basle Rural, Switzerland. \r\n7.   Until 1983 he lived with his wife and their two sons, Tuncay (born on 12 October 1971) and Ersin (born on 20 January 1983), in the town of Gümüshane in Turkey.  On 25 April 1983 he travelled to Switzerland, where he applied for political asylum as a Kurd and former member of the Turkish Social Democratic Party (\"the CHP\").  He worked in a restaurant there until 1990, when he fell ill.  Since then he has been in receipt of a partial-invalidity pension. \r\n8.   In 1987 the applicant’s wife, who had remained in Turkey with their two sons, seriously burned herself during a fit brought on by her epilepsy, from which she had suffered since 1982.  In December 1987, having found that it was impossible for her to obtain proper treatment in the area where she was then living, she joined her husband in Switzerland, where she was taken into hospital as an emergency case.  Two of the fingers of her left hand were amputated. \r\n9.   On 19 September 1988 in Switzerland Mrs Gül gave birth to her third child, Nursal, a daughter.  As she still suffered from epilepsy, she could not take care of the baby, who was placed in a home in Switzerland, where she has remained ever since.  In a written declaration dated 31 March 1989, a Pratteln specialist in internal medicine stated that a return to Turkey would be impossible for Mrs Gül and might even prove fatal to her, given her serious medical condition. \r\n10.   On 9 February 1989 the Minister for Refugees rejected Mr Gül’s application for political asylum, on the ground that he had not been able to establish that he personally had been a victim of persecution, as the general situation of the Kurdish population in Turkey was not in itself sufficient to justify granting political asylum.  He went on to say that, according to reliable sources, no measures were being taken by the State authorities against former members of the CHP, and ordered the applicant to leave Switzerland by 30 April 1989, failing which he would be deported.\r\nOn 10 March 1989 the applicant appealed against the above decision to the Federal Justice and Police Department.  He asserted that the collective repression of Kurds in Turkey, of which he himself had been a victim, in itself justified granting political asylum.  In addition, at the time when he had fled to Switzerland all political parties had been proscribed and their members - especially the members of left-wing parties like the CHP - were being prosecuted.  He could not therefore be required to return to Turkey, and this would be in breach of Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention. \r\n11.   In a letter of 26 June 1989, the Basle Rural Cantonal Aliens Police (Fremdenpolizei) informed the applicant’s lawyer that they supported Mr Gül’s request for a residence permit (Aufenthaltsbewilligung) on humanitarian grounds in respect of himself, his wife and his daughter Nursal.\r\nIn view of the length of time Mr Gül had been living in Switzerland and his wife’s precarious state of health, the police considered that the conditions for the issue of such a permit laid down in Article 13 (f) of the Federal Council’s Order Limiting the Number of Aliens (\"the OLNA\" - see paragraph 21 below) had been satisfied.  The final decision to grant a residence permit was given by the Federal Aliens Office on 15 February 1990. \r\n12.   As the Federal Justice and Police Department had informed Mr Gül that his application for political asylum had only very limited prospects of success on appeal, he withdrew it.  The authorities took formal note of this on 8 November 1989.\r\nB. Steps taken by the applicant with a view to bringing his two sons to Switzerland\r\n1. Before the Basle Rural Cantonal Aliens Police \r\n13.   On 14 May 1990 Mr Gül asked the Basle Rural Cantonal Aliens Police for permission to bring to Switzerland his two sons, Tuncay and Ersin, who had remained in Turkey. \r\n14.   In a decision of 19 September 1990 the Aliens Police rejected Mr Gül’s request, on the ground that the conditions for family reunion had not been satisfied (Article 39 of the OLNA - see paragraph 21 below).  Firstly, the Gül family’s flat did not conform to the standards laid down and, secondly, the applicant did not have sufficient means to provide for his family.  In any event, Tuncay was already eighteen and was therefore ineligible for a residence permit under the rules governing family reunion.\r\n2. Before the Basle Rural cantonal government \r\n15.   On 1 October 1990 the applicant appealed against this decision to the Basle Rural cantonal government (Regierungsrat). He argued that the residence permit issued to him and his wife under Article 13 (f) of the OLNA should have been extended to include his two sons, as his personal circumstances made it an extremely serious case.  Since it was impossible to return to Turkey because of his wife’s precarious state of health and the length of time he had lived abroad, the family could be brought back together only in Switzerland.  Both Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights, guaranteeing the right to respect for family life, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child gave the two boys the right to join their parents in Switzerland.  If the cantonal government were nevertheless to rely on the provisions of Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) on family reunion, the younger son, Ersin, could and should be permitted to exercise that right. There was enough room for him in the family’s flat and Mr Gül’s financial resources were sufficient to provide for his family. \r\n16.   On 30 July 1991 the Basle Rural cantonal government dismissed the applicant’s appeal.  It pointed out that under section 4 of the Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act (\"the RSAA\" - see paragraph 20 below) the question whether to grant a residence permit (Aufenthaltsbewilligung) or settlement permit (Niederlassungsbewilligung) was determined by the competent cantonal authorities with unfettered discretion (nach freiem Ermessen), having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and international agreements.  In that connection, the authorities had to take account of the country’s moral and economic interests, and of the degree of immigrant penetration (Überfremdung).\r\nThe cantonal government then considered whether Mr Gül’s two sons could rely on a right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland (Anwesenheitsbewilligung) on the basis of the statutory provisions, as the agreement on settlement concluded by Turkey and Switzerland on 13 December 1990 did not confer such a right.     \r\nUnder section 17 (2) of the RSAA (see paragraph 20 below) a minor did not have such a right unless his parent was in possession of a settlement permit.  As Mr and Mrs Gül only had a residence permit, they could not rely on that provision in order to assert a right to family reunion.  As for the guarantees set forth in Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, only Swiss nationals or persons in possession of a settlement permit could rely on these; Mr and Mrs Gül fell into neither of those categories.\r\nArticles 38 et seq. of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) did not confer a right but merely set out the minimum conditions to be satisfied before family reunion could be authorised.  The cantonal authorities had the final say on the matter, and in reaching their decision they had unfettered discretion.  It being established that the provisions concerned could only apply, if at all, to the minor son, Ersin, the cantonal government listed the minimum conditions which Article 39 para. 1 of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below) required to be satisfied by a foreigner living in Switzerland before family reunion could be authorised, namely:\r\n(a) his residence and, where relevant, his gainful employment should appear to be sufficiently stable; \r\n(b) he should live with his family and occupy accommodation suitable for that purpose; \r\n(c) he should have sufficient means to support his family;\r\nand \r\n(d) firm arrangements should have been made for the care of any children who still needed their parents’ presence. \r\nThe cantonal government did not determine points (a) and (b), but carefully considered points (c) and (d), on which it gave the following decision:\r\n\"(c) The calculations made by the Aliens Police and the cantonal government’s legal service, which investigated the case, show that Mr Gül has not satisfied the condition laid down in Article 39 para. 1 (c) of the OLNA.  He does not have sufficient means to support his family during their residence in Switzerland.  According to the reference calculation, Mr Gül should have a monthly net income of at least 2,710 Swiss francs (CHF) if he is not to fall below the minimum standard of living.  That figure is derived from the base rates used by the cantonal social security office for assessing the likelihood of reliance on social security, which are on the whole identical with the base rates adopted by the Swiss Conference on Public Assistance for the calculation of financial support.  These base rates are used to establish the monthly living expenses of the foreigner concerned and the members of his family seeking to join him, which have to be covered by his income.  This must be sufficient to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also a minimum standard of living. In this way the legitimate interest of the public authorities in preventing the family from becoming a burden on the social security services is also taken into account. \r\nMr Gül’s net monthly income is CHF 2,060, which falls CHF 650 short of the amount required for the minimum standard of living as calculated by the social security services.  The cost of keeping the youngest child, Nursal, in a children’s home has not been taken into account, as it is not known who pays for this.  The calculation of income is based on pay-slips from 1989, the latest available.  On 23 October 1990 the Liestal Cantonal Hospital sent the Basle Rural Aliens Police a medical certificate stating that Mr Gül was 100% unfit for work and would remain so for a period that it was not possible to determine.  On enquiry being made, it was confirmed in a medical certificate dated 19 April 1991 that Mr Gül had suffered from 100% incapacity since April 1990 and would remain unfit for work for the foreseeable future.  The Pratteln municipal social security services stated in a letter of 11 June 1991 that Mr Gül would have to have several operations and that for the time being he was waiting to be awarded an invalidity pension. For the first three months of this year alone the social security services have paid the Gül family CHF 8,731.75, and the family will remain dependent on social security payments.  In June 1991 Mr Gül stated during a personal interview with the subordinate authority (Vorinstanz) that his family was at that time entirely dependent on social security payments.  He therefore has no other source of income.  At present the social security services are paying the Gül family the amount needed by a three-person family, but no more.  The social security services cannot be expected to provide for children arriving from abroad when it is known in advance that they will have to support them. Nor can Mr Gül support his other children from his own resources.  For that reason alone the application for family reunion must be refused. \r\n(d) Article 39 para. 1 (d) also requires firm arrangements to be made for the care of children.  But Mrs Gül, for reasons connected with her illness, is not mentally or physically capable of keeping her daughter Nursal with her and looking after her.  That is why Nursal has been brought up in the \"Auf Berg\" children’s home in Seltisberg, where she is to remain.  It follows that if Mr and Mrs Gül’s eight-year-old son Ersin joined the family, it is not at all certain that firm arrangements could be made for his care.  He too would presumably have to be brought up in a children’s home, which is not the aim of family reunion. A medical certificate dated 18 April 1991 states that Mrs Gül is suffering from a serious illness which makes it necessary for her to have constant medical supervision and treatment.  She might even need to go into hospital again. That prospect makes it impossible to consider that firm arrangements have been made for the child’s care as the Order requires.\" \r\nThe cantonal government went on to say that residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds under Article 13 (f) of the OLNA could not in addition confer on the recipients a right to family reunion.  In order to ensure equal treatment for all aliens not having the right to reside in Switzerland, such reunion could take place only under Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA.\r\nLastly, the cantonal government considered the situation of the younger boy from the standpoint of Article 36 of the OLNA (see paragraph 21 below), announcing its decision in the following terms:\r\n\"Ersin Gül is only eight.  It must be determined whether his entry into Switzerland would be in accordance with Article 36 of the OLNA, which requires an `important reason’ that is lacking in this case.  There is no special reason for treating Ersin Gül differently from other children wishing to rejoin their families in respect of whom the conditions laid down in Articles 38 et seq. of the OLNA have not been satisfied.  Another reason for refusing to admit him to Switzerland is the fact that Ersin and Tuncay Gül would be separated.  Ersin has lived with Tuncay since birth.  On the other hand, he has been separated from his father and mother for eight years and three and a half years respectively.  Having regard to the child’s welfare, which plays an important role in family reunion cases, the question arises, at the very least, whether it is reasonable to separate him from his brother and the environment he is used to in order to bring him to live with his mother, who is seriously ill and unable to keep him with her or look after him, and his father, who went away to Switzerland three month’s after Ersin’s birth, which means that he hardly knows him.  In view of all the circumstances, and having regard to the child’s welfare, the cantonal government considers that Ersin Gül should not be authorised to join his parents in Switzerland.  In any case, there is no important reason within the meaning of Article 36 of the OLNA which requires him to be admitted to Switzerland.\" \r\nThe cantonal government concluded that Mr Gül had not satisfied the conditions laid down for family reunion and that his children could not rely on Article 13 (f) or Article 36 of the OLNA either in order to come to Switzerland to join him.\r\n3. In the Federal Court \r\n17.   On 2 September 1991 the applicant lodged an administrative-law appeal with the Swiss Federal Court.  He repeated his previous arguments (see paragraph 15 above) and added that, because of the \"special circumstances\", Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention gave his sons the right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland.  The earlier issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds to himself, his wife and his daughter had been based on the finding that a return to Turkey was impossible, as it would put the health of his wife and daughter seriously at risk.  Mr Gül argued that the same considerations which had prevailed in the decision to grant that residence permit should prevent any withdrawal thereof, which would be tantamount to subjecting Mrs Gül, whose state of health was still causing concern, to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.  The residence permit issued to Mr and Mrs Gül on humanitarian grounds was therefore the equivalent of a settlement permit, and it followed that they had the right to family reunion, which could only take place in Switzerland. \r\n18.   In a judgment of 2 July 1993 the Federal Court declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible.  It pointed out that, pursuant to section 100 (b) (3) of the Federal Administration of Justice Act, an administrative-law appeal in an immigration-control case was inadmissible if it concerned the issue or refusal of permits to which federal legislation conferred no entitlement.  Like the cantonal government, the Federal Court found that neither section 17 (2) of the RSAA nor Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention conferred such a right on an alien resident outside Switzerland whose parent living in Switzerland had only a residence permit, as Mr Gül did.  In particular, Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention could be relied on only by a person who had the right of abode in Switzerland either by virtue of his Swiss nationality or by virtue of a settlement permit.  The court gave this ruling in the following terms:\r\n\"Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to respect for family life.  In certain circumstances the right to be issued with a residence permit can be deduced from this (see ATF [Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 118 Ib 152 at 4, 157 at c; 116 Ib 355 at 1b; 109 Ib 185 at 2), so that Article 8 (art. 8) may be breached where an alien whose family lives in Switzerland is refused leave to enter the country. According to the Federal Court’s established case-law, however, a breach can occur only where the family members living in Switzerland themselves possess a well-established right of abode (Anwesenheitsrecht).  For that purpose, it is in principle necessary to have Swiss nationality or possess a settlement permit (see ATF 116 Ib 355 at 1b; 115 Ib 4 at 1d).  A mere residence permit is at any rate not sufficient unless it is based on a firmly established right (see ATF 111 Ib 163/4 at 1a), as the Federal Court has held in many unpublished judgments (most recently in the judgment of 6 April 1993 in the case of K., at 1b) ... That is, moreover, consistent with the new provisions on the legal status of aliens having family members in Switzerland (sections 7 and 17 (2) of the RSAA, as amended on 23 March 1990, which came into force on 1 January 1992). Under the Act the right to family reunion presupposes a firmly established right of abode, as pointed out above (at 1b).  Given that the legislature’s intention in adopting the amendment in question was precisely to take account of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights (see Bbl [Federal Gazette] 1987 III, pp. 293 et seq., particularly pp. 321 and 322), there is no reason, when that provision (art. 8) of the Convention is invoked with regard to recognition of legal rights in the matter of residence permits, to go beyond what the Act itself expressly provides (see the Federal Court’s unpublished judgment of 6 April 1993 in the case of K., at 1b).\" \r\nThe Federal Court also emphasised the differences between settlement permits and residence permits, stating: \r\n\"Unlike settlement permits, which are issued for an indefinite period (section 6 (1) of the Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act - hereinafter the RSAA), residence permits are always subject to a time-limit (section 5 (1) of the RSAA).  Whatever the reason for granting the first residence permit, an alien must therefore allow for the possibility that his permit will not be renewed.  There could be many reasons for this, including, for example, police, economic or demographic considerations.  Although the alien’s personal circumstances have to be taken into account in the inquiry into the proportionality of the decision not to renew, that does not mean that the alien is on that account entitled to have his residence permit renewed. \r\nThe above statement of the law also applies to residence permits issued on humanitarian grounds.  The only effect of a finding that a case is an extremely serious one within the meaning of Article 13 (f) of the Federal Council’s Order Limiting the Number of Aliens of 6 October 1986 (hereinafter the OLNA - SR 823.21) is to exclude the alien concerned from the quotas laid down in that Order; it does not imply the existence of a right to a residence permit. The Aliens Police prefer to remain free to decide when such a permit should be issued (see ATF 119 Ib 35 at 1a).  In addition, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the particular circumstances which justified the issue of a residence permit on humanitarian grounds will subsequently cease to exist, or lose their significance to such an extent that not only will there no longer be any reason to exclude the person concerned from the quotas, but even renewal of the residence permit will no longer be justified.  Moreover, it is apparent from the rule established in Article 12 para. 2 of the OLNA that the conditions required for a finding that the case is an extremely serious one may subsequently cease to exist (see the unpublished judgment of 3 July 1992 in the case of P., at 6).  The question whether the case is of this type is therefore entirely separate from the question whether the person concerned has the right to obtain permission to reside in Switzerland by virtue of Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights (see ATF 115 Ib 8). \r\nFurthermore, in the instant case the possibility cannot be entirely ruled out that in the future the medical or other reasons which led the authorities to grant the residence permit will lose their significance, or that new grounds justifying a refusal to renew the permit will become apparent.  The appellant can therefore not deduce from the fact that he is authorised to reside in Switzerland any right to the issue of a residence permit for his sons.\" \r\nThe Federal Court went on to say that the question how the OLNA should be applied to the issue of permits was not one it had to examine in connection with the administrative-law appeal, as the cantonal government had already looked into the question whether the Güls’ younger son could be issued with a residence permit under Article 36 of the OLNA. \r\nC. Situation of the applicant’s son Ersin in Turkey \r\n19.   Ersin has lived in Turkey since his birth, at first in Gümüshane until 1993 (with his mother until 1987), and then in Istanbul.\r\nAccording to the Government, he is at present living, as is his grandfather, with the family of his elder brother Tuncay, and has been visited several times by his father.\r\nThe applicant maintained that Ersin frequently moved from one home to another and spent two or three days staying with various Kurdish families who used to live in the village where he was born, including the family of his elder brother.  Owing to his grandfather’s limited financial resources and the distance between the homes of some of these families and the school it was not possible for the boy to attend school on a regular basis.\r\nAs is evidenced by an article which appeared in the Turkish newspaper Sabah on 25 July 1995, Mr and Mrs Gül visited their son in Turkey in July and August 1995. \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\r\nA. The Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act  (RSAA) of 26 March 1931 \r\n20.   The Federal Residence and Settlement of Aliens Act provides:\r\nSection 4\r\n\"The authority shall have discretion to decide, having regard to the relevant statutory provisions and treaties with foreign States, whether to grant residence or settlement permits.\"\r\nSection 16\r\n\"1.   When deciding whether to grant a permit the authorities must take account of the country’s moral and economic interests, and of the degree of immigrant penetration. \r\n...\"\r\nSection 17\r\n\"1.   As a general rule, the authority shall first issue only a residence permit, even if it is foreseen that the alien will establish his permanent residence in Switzerland.  In each case the Federal Aliens Office shall fix the date from which permission to settle may be granted. \r\n2.   Where that date has already been fixed, or where the alien is in possession of a settlement permit, his spouse shall be entitled to a residence permit for as long as the couple continue to live together.  On completion of five years’ uninterrupted lawful residence the spouse shall also become entitled to a settlement permit.  Unmarried children under 18 shall have the right to be included in the settlement permit for as long as they continue to live with their parents.  These rights shall be extinguished if the beneficiary has engaged in conduct contrary to public policy.\" \r\nBefore 1 January 1992 the second paragraph of this section read: \r\n\"Where that date has already been fixed, or where the alien is in possession of a settlement permit, his wife and his children under 18 shall have the right to be included in the permit if they form part of his household.\" \r\nB. The Order Limiting the Number of Aliens (OLNA) of 6 October 1986 \r\n21.   The relevant provisions of the Order Limiting the Number of Aliens are the following:\r\nArticle 13 - Exceptions\r\n\"The following categories of person shall not be included in the quotas: \r\n... \r\n(f) aliens issued with residence permits in extremely serious personal cases or on general policy grounds. \r\n...\" \r\nBefore 18 October 1989 the expression \"extremely serious personal cases\" read: \"cases of extreme adversity\". \r\nArticle 36 - Other aliens without gainful employment \r\n\"Residence permits may be issued to other aliens without gainful employment where important reasons so require.\"\r\nChapter 4: Family reunion\r\nArticle 38 - Principle\r\n\"1.   The Cantonal Aliens Police may authorise an alien to bring to Switzerland his spouse and his dependent unmarried children under 18. \r\n...\"\r\nArticle 39 - Conditions \r\n\"1.   An alien may be authorised to bring his family without being required to complete any qualifying period ... \r\n(a) if his residence and, where relevant, his gainful employment appear to be sufficiently stable; \r\n(b) if he lives with his family and occupies accommodation suitable for that purpose; \r\n(c) if he has sufficient means to support his family; and \r\n(d) if firm arrangements have been made for the care of any children who still need their parents’ presence. \r\n2.   Accommodation is suitable if it meets the standards applicable to Swiss nationals in the area where the alien wishes to live.\" \r\nBefore 20 October 1993 the words \"without being required to complete any qualifying period\" were not part of the text. \r\nC. Case-law of the Swiss Federal Court \r\n22.   According to the established case-law of the Federal Court, a person is entitled under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention to join a member of his family in Switzerland if the latter is a Swiss national or is in possession of a settlement permit (Judgments of the Federal Court (ATF) vol. 116, part Ib, p. 355; vol. 115, part Ib, p. 4; vol. 111, part Ib, pp. 163 et seq.). \r\nD. The convention on social security concluded by Switzerland and Turkey on 1 May 1969 \r\n23.   Replying to the question asked at the hearing by one member of the Court, the Government stated that by virtue of the convention on social security concluded by Switzerland and the Republic of Turkey on 1 May 1969, which came into force on 1 January 1972 with effect from 1 January 1969, invalidity insurance benefits payable in either country are also payable in the other.  In the instant case, if Mr Gül returned to Turkey, he would receive CHF 915, made up of his ordinary pension (CHF 436) and half of the supplementary pension paid in respect of his wife (CHF 131), his son Ersin (CHF 174) and his daughter Nursal (CHF 174).\r\nThe applicant asserted that only his invalidity pension, not the social security benefits, could be paid to him in Turkey. Moreover, his invalidity pension was currently under review; if his invalidity were to be assessed as less than 50%, his pension could no longer be transferred to Turkey. \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION \r\n24.   Mr Gül applied to the Commission on 31 December 1993.  He alleged that the Swiss authorities’ refusal to allow his two sons, Tuncay and Ersin, to join him in Switzerland constituted a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. \r\n25.   On 10 October 1994 the Commission declared the application (no. 23218/94) admissible as regards the complaint under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention concerning Ersin.  It declared the remainder of the application inadmissible.\r\nIn its report of 4 April 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by fourteen votes to ten, that there had been a violation of Article 8 (art. 8).  The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT \r\n26.   In their memorial the Government asked the Court to hold in the instant case:  \r\n\"primarily, that Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is not applicable; in the alternative, that there was no `interference’ by the Swiss public authorities with the applicant’s exercise of his right to enjoy a family life with his son Ersin;  in the further alternative, if such interference is held to have occurred, that it was justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) of the Convention.\" \r\n27.   The applicant asked the Court to find that the conditions laid down in Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2) of the Convention had not been satisfied and to uphold the Commission’s opinion on this point. \r\nAS TO THE LAW \r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8) OF THE CONVENTION \r\n28.   Mr Gül submitted that the Swiss authorities’ refusal to permit his son Ersin to join him in Switzerland had infringed his right to respect for his family life.  He relied on Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which provides: \r\n\"1.   Everyone has the right to respect for his ... family life ... \r\n2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\" \r\n29.   It is first necessary to determine whether there is a \"family life\" within the meaning of Article 8 (art. 8). \r\n30.   The Government’s primary submission was that Article 8 (art. 8) was not applicable, since in the instant case the element of intention inherent in the concept of family life was missing.  Mr Gül had left Turkey when his younger son Ersin was three months old, and had never attempted to develop a family life in his country of origin.  In addition, the focus of that son’s family life was in Turkey since, even after his mother’s departure, the child had been taken in as a member of his elder brother’s family.  Furthermore, the fact that Mr and Mrs Gül’s daughter Nursal had been placed in a home in Switzerland showed that they were in any event incapable of assuming their parental responsibilities with regard to the boy. \r\n31.   Like the applicant, the Commission considered that the bond between Mr Gül and his son Ersin amounted to \"family life\". \r\n32.   The Court reiterates that it follows from the concept of family on which Article 8 (art. 8) is based that a child born of a marital union is ipso jure part of that relationship; hence, from the moment of the child’s birth and by the very fact of it, there exists between him and his parents a bond amounting to \"family life\" (see the Berrehab v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 June 1988, series A no. 138, p. 14, para. 21, and the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 19, para. 54) which subsequent events cannot break save in exceptional circumstances. \r\n33.   Admittedly, Mr Gül left Turkey in 1983, when his son Ersin was only three months old (see paragraph 7 above); Mrs Gül left Ersin in 1987 because of her accident (see paragraph 8 above).\r\nHowever, after obtaining a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in Switzerland in 1990, the applicant asked the Swiss authorities for permission to bring the boy, who was then six years old, to Switzerland (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). Subsequently, he repeatedly asked the Swiss courts to allow his son to join him, before bringing his case before the Convention institutions.  Despite the distance, in geographical terms, between them, the applicant has made a number of visits to Turkey, the last of these being in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above).  It cannot therefore be claimed that the bond of \"family life\" between them has been broken. \r\n34.   Secondly, it is necessary to ascertain whether there was interference by the Swiss authorities with the applicant’s right under Article 8 (art. 8). \r\n35.   Mr Gül submitted that the result in practice of the authorities’ persistent refusal to allow Ersin to join him in Switzerland had been to separate the family and make it impossible, owing to lack of sufficient financial resources, for the parents to maintain regular contacts with their son, whereas, according to the Court’s case-law, contacts between parents and child were of capital importance.  In addition, the length of time Mr Gül had lived in Switzerland, his invalidity and his wife’s ill-health made family reunion in Turkey an unrealistic prospect, so that the family could only be brought together again in Switzerland. \r\n36.   The Government submitted that the applicant could not rely on a right to family reunion in Switzerland, as he had only a humanitarian permit, which was not a true settlement permit but merely a document authorising residence that could be withdrawn from him.  In addition, Switzerland had fully discharged the positive obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), as the invalidity pension the applicant was in receipt of enabled him to make occasional visits to Turkey.  In any event, Switzerland was in no way responsible for the situation the Gül family was in.  Lastly, the Swiss authorities were not under any obligation to ensure that the applicant led an optimal family life in Switzerland. \r\n37.   The Commission considered that where a parent wanted his minor child to live with him, preventing this amounted to interference with his right to respect for family life, and that the family would need to be reunited in Switzerland rather than in Turkey in view of Mr and Mrs Gül’s particular circumstances.  \r\n38.   The Court reiterates that the essential object of Article 8 (art. 8) is to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities.  There may in addition be positive obligations inherent in effective \"respect\" for family life. However, the boundaries between the State’s positive and negative obligations under this provision (art. 8) do not lend themselves to precise definition.  The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar.  In both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as a whole; and in both contexts the State enjoys a certain margin of appreciation (see, most recently, the Keegan v. Ireland judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, para. 49, and the Kroon and Others v. the Netherlands judgment of 27 October 1994, Series A no. 297-C, p. 56, para. 31).\r\nThe present case concerns not only family life but also immigration, and the extent of a State’s obligation to admit to its territory relatives of settled immigrants will vary according to the particular circumstances of the persons involved and the general interest.  As a matter of well-established international law and subject to its treaty obligations, a State has the right to control the entry of non-nationals into its territory (see, among other authorities, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 33-34, para. 67).\r\nMoreover, where immigration is concerned, Article 8 (art. 8) cannot be considered to impose on a State a general obligation to respect the choice by married couples of the country of their matrimonial residence and to authorise family reunion in its territory.  In order to establish the scope of the State’s obligations, the facts of the case must be considered (see, mutatis mutandis, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment previously cited, p. 34, para. 68, and the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 32, para. 88). \r\n39.   In this case, therefore, the Court’s task is to determine to what extent it is true that Ersin’s move to Switzerland would be the only way for Mr Gül to develop family life with his son. \r\n40.   The applicant left Turkey in 1983 and made his way to Switzerland, where he applied for political asylum; this application was rejected by the Minister for Refugees in 1989 (see paragraph 10 above).  His wife joined him in 1987 so that she could receive medical treatment in Switzerland after a serious accident.  Their daughter Nursal was placed from birth in a home in Switzerland and has remained there ever since (see paragraph 9 above).  In 1990 Mr and Mrs Gül were granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and then sought permission to bring their son Ersin to Switzerland.  Ersin has always lived in Turkey (see paragraph 19 above). \r\n41.   By leaving Turkey in 1983, Mr Gül caused the separation from his son, and he was unable to prove to the Swiss authorities - who refused to grant him political refugee status - that he personally had been a victim of persecution in his home country. In any event, whatever the applicant’s initial reasons for applying for political asylum, the visits he has made to his son in recent years tend to show that they are no longer valid.  His counsel, moreover, expressly confirmed this at the hearing.  In addition, according to the Government, by virtue of a social security convention concluded on 1 May 1969 between Switzerland and Turkey, the applicant could continue to receive his ordinary invalidity pension and half of the supplementary benefit he receives at present in respect of his wife, his son Ersin and his daughter Nursal if he returned to his home country (see paragraph 23 above).\r\nMrs Gül’s return to Turkey is more problematic, since it was essentially her state of health that led the Swiss authorities to issue a residence permit on humanitarian grounds.  However, although her state of health seemed particularly alarming in 1987, when her accident occurred, it has not been proved that she could not later have received appropriate medical treatment in specialist hospitals in Turkey.  She was, moreover, able to visit Turkey with her husband in July and August 1995 (see paragraph 19 above).\r\nFurthermore, although Mr and Mrs Gül are lawfully resident in Switzerland, they do not have a permanent right of abode, as they do not have a settlement permit but merely a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, which could be withdrawn, and which under Swiss law does not give them a right to family reunion (see paragraph 18 above). \r\n42.   In view of the length of time Mr and Mrs Gül have lived in Switzerland, it would admittedly not be easy for them to return to Turkey, but there are, strictly speaking, no obstacles preventing them from developing family life in Turkey.  That possibility is all the more real because Ersin has always lived there and has therefore grown up in the cultural and linguistic environment of his country.  On that point the situation is not the same as in the Berrehab case, where the daughter of a Moroccan applicant had been born in the Netherlands and spent all her life there (see the Berrehab judgment previously cited, p. 8, para. 7). \r\n43.   Having regard to all these considerations, and while acknowledging that the Gül family’s situation is very difficult from the human point of view, the Court finds that Switzerland has not failed to fulfil the obligations arising under Article 8 para. 1 (art. 8-1), and there has therefore been no interference in the applicant’s family life within the meaning of that Article (art. 8-1). \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT \r\nHolds by seven votes to two that there has been no breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention. \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 19 February 1996. \r\n\r\n\t\tRudolf BERNHARDT\r\n\t\tPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the dissenting opinion of Mr Martens, approved by Mr Russo, is annexed to this judgment.\r\nR. B.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS, APPROVED BY JUDGE RUSSO\r\nA. Introduction\r\n1.   To my regret I have not been able to persuade the majority. I remain unable to share their opinion.  I will refrain from arguing why, but just set out my own judgment.  I trust that from that judgment it will be sufficiently clear why I could not join the majority. \r\n2.   What is at stake in this case is whether the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland with his parents violated Switzerland’s obligation under Article 8 (art. 8) to respect the applicant’s family life.  Consequently, the circumstances obtaining at the date of the (first) refusal of the requested authorisation - that is 19 September 1990 - are decisive.\r\nI will come back to these circumstances hereinafter (see paragraph 14), but I note already here that on 19 September 1990 the applicant and his wife were living lawfully in Switzerland having been granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds on 15 February 1990.  Their son Ersin, who was born on 20 January 1983, was then 7 years old and lived in Turkey under circumstances which still remain controversial (see paragraph 12 below). \r\n3.   One more preliminary remark with regard to the facts.  The Court has repeatedly stressed that it is not bound by the Commission’s findings of fact and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it (see, inter alia, the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 29, para. 74).  In doing so we should, however, bear in mind our limitations and be particularly careful not to take into account facts other than those which are properly established.  The Government have contended - without basing their contention on specific facts - that in 1983 the applicant left Turkey \"of his own free will, preferring to seek employment in Switzerland\" thereby suggesting that the applicant’s assertion that he came to Switzerland as a refugee was a falsehood.  However, although the applicant sought asylum on 26 April 1983, his application was only dismissed on 9 February 1989 together with that of his wife (which dated from 8 February 1988).  The applicant appealed.  This appeal was never decided because the applicant withdrew his application, since - as his counsel put it without being contradicted - pursuing the application for asylum was incompatible with accepting the residence permit on humanitarian grounds that had been offered to him and his wife.  Under these circumstances it is not for us to simply base ourselves on the refusal at first instance or to speculate, thirteen years hence, on the truth and relevance of the assertions underlying the applicant’s asylum request.  True, it is common ground that in the summer of 1995 the applicant visited Ersin in Turkey and, although attracting notice by a press interview, has apparently not experienced any disagreeableness from the Turkish authorities.  However, that does not in itself warrant the conclusion that thirteen years earlier, in 1983, the applicant had no relevant and sufficient grounds for fleeing from persecution in Turkey and requesting asylum in Switzerland. \r\nB. Applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) \r\n4.   In its Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, the Court adopted the established doctrine of the Commission that although, certainly, the right of aliens to enter or to remain in a country is not as such guaranteed by the Convention, immigration controls have to be exercised consistently with Convention obligations and that, accordingly, the exclusion of a person from a State where members of his family are living may raise an issue under Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 59 and 60 of the judgment). Since this judgment there has been a considerable evolution in the Court’s general doctrine on Article 8 (art. 8), but not on this point.  On the contrary, its subsequent case-law has solidly confirmed the principle that, although Contracting States have, as a matter of well-established international law, the right to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens, that right is subject to their obligations under the Convention, notably those under Article 8 (art. 8) (see the Berrehab v. the Netherlands judgment of 21 June 1988, Series A no. 138, pp. 15-16, paras. 28-29; the Moustaquim v. Belgium judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 193, p. 19, para. 43; the Cruz Varas and Others judgment cited above, p. 28, para. 70; the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 34, para. 102; the Beldjoudi v. France judgment of 26 March 1992, Series A no. 234-A, p. 27, para. 74; and the Nasri v. France judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 320-B, p. 25, para. 41).\r\nAccordingly, if on 19 September 1990 there existed \"family life\" between the applicant and his son Ersin, the applicability of Article 8 (art. 8) to the facts of the present case cannot be called into question.  To the evolution in the Court’s general doctrine on Article 8 (art. 8) I will return in paragraph 7 below. \r\n5.   On 19 September 1990 there certainly was a family life relationship between the applicant and Ersin.  Since Ersin was born from the legitimate marriage between the applicant and his wife, it follows from the aforementioned Berrehab judgment (p. 14, para. 21) that there is ipso facto such a relationship (see also the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 19, para. 54).  True, as the Court recognised in the Berrehab judgment, subsequent events may break such a family life relationship, but only exceptional circumstances can warrant the conclusion that the tie between a parent and his or her child is severed.  The mere fact that, at the relevant date, the applicant had not seen his then seven-year-old son for almost seven years is not sufficient to produce this negative effect.  In this context it is immaterial whether the applicant left his wife and Ersin under fear from political prosecution or purely for economic reasons. \r\nC. Is Switzerland in breach of an obligation under Article 8 (art. 8)?\r\n6.   \"According to the Court’s well established case-law, ‘the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company constitutes a fundamental element of family life’\", as the Court pointed out in paragraph 86 of the McMichael v. the United Kingdom judgment of 24 February 1995, Series A no. 307-B, p. 55. Consequently, decisions of State authorities hindering such enjoyment in principle amount to an infringement of the State’s obligation to respect the family life of those concerned.  It follows that the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland in principle entails their responsibility under Article 8 (art. 8).\r\nBefore it is possible to assess whether the refusal was justified, it is - alas - necessary to give some consideration to the question whether or not Switzerland’s obligation under Article 8 (art. 8) is a positive or a negative one. \r\nD. Positive or negative obligation? \r\n7.   The Court’s case-law distinguishes between positive and negative obligations.  Negative obligations require member States to refrain from action, positive to take action.  The Court has repeatedly stressed that the boundaries between the two types \"do not lend themselves to precise definition\" (see, for instance, the Keegan v. Ireland judgment of 26 May 1994, Series A no. 290, p. 19, para. 49).  The present case well illustrates the truth of this proposition since the question whether the Swiss decision violated a positive or a negative obligation, if either, seems hardly more than one of semantics: the refusal of the Swiss authorities to let Ersin and his parents be reunited may be considered as an action from which they should have refrained, whereas it could arguably also be viewed as failing to take an action which they were required to take, namely making a reunion possible by granting the authorisation.  If one takes the view that, if there is a violation at all, it must be of a positive obligation - a view that finds support in the aforementioned Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment (see paragraph 4 above) - then one has to put up with the rather awkward systematic inconsistency that exclusion of a person from a state where his family lives does not fall into the same category of breaches as expulsion of a person from a state where his family lives: the former decision may be in breach of a positive obligation under Article 8 (art. 8), whereas the latter may be in breach of a negative obligation. \r\n8.   These and other difficulties in distinguishing between cases where positive and cases where negative obligations are at stake would be immaterial if both kinds of obligation were treated alike.  There was a time, however, when the Court’s case-law did treat them differently.\r\nThe Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment is a striking instance: see paragraph 67 of that judgment.  Under the pretext of the vagueness of the notion \"respect\" in Article 8 (art. 8) the Court held that its requirements will vary from case to case, thus creating for itself the possibility of taking into account, when establishing whether or not there is a positive obligation, whether or not there is a consensus between member States and, moreover, a wide margin of appreciation for the State concerned. This approach has been rightly criticised both outside and inside the Court.  One of the main objections was that under this doctrine, in the context of positive obligations, the margin of appreciation might already come into play at the stage of determining the existence of the obligation, whilst in the context of negative obligations it only plays a role, if at all, at the stage of determining whether a breach of the obligation is justified.\r\nThe Court’s doctrine on this point has, however, evolved considerably since the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment.  The aforementioned difference in treatment between positive and negative obligations has gradually dwindled away. The Court now holds that the applicable principles are similar, adding that in both contexts regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and the community (see, inter alia: the above-mentioned Keegan judgment, loc. cit. (paragraph 7 above); the above-mentioned Hokkanen judgment, p. 20, para. 55; and the Stjerna v. Finland judgment of 25 November 1994, Series A no. 299-B, p. 61, para. 39). \r\n9.   For present purposes it may, therefore, be assumed that it makes no material difference whether a positive or a negative obligation is at stake.  The present doctrine notably implies that the distinction between the two types of obligation has no bearing on either the burden of proof or the standards for assessing whether a fair balance has been struck.\r\nIt follows that the refusal of the Swiss authorities to grant the applicant’s son Ersin authorisation to reside in Switzerland amounts to a violation of Article 8 (art. 8), unless it is deemed justified under paragraph 2 of that Article (art. 8-2) or under similar principles to those enshrined therein.\r\nI agree with the Commission that the requirements of \"in accordance with the law\" and \"legitimate aim\" are fulfilled.  The applicant’s argument that the refusal was not \"in accordance with the law\" did not convince me.  On the other hand I cannot help saying that I consider the Government’s attempt to embellish the harsh, political objectives of their decision by pleading that in the first place it was designed to serve Ersin’s interests rather hypocritical.  The stress laid on financial considerations makes it clear that the legitimate aim pursued was, if not only then mainly, \"the interests of the economic well-being of the country\".\r\nIt follows that in any event the decisive question is whether the refusal of authorisation to reside in Switzerland was proportionate. \r\nE. Was the refusal proportionate? \r\n10.   Was it \"necessary in a democratic society\" to refuse the applicant’s seven-year-old son Ersin authorisation to come and live in Switzerland with his parents?  In other words, did that decision of the Swiss authorities strike a fair balance between the competing interests of the applicant, his wife and their son on the one hand and those of the community as a whole on the other? \r\n11.   In explaining the interests of the community the Government have stressed that Switzerland has a very high percentage of foreigners living within its borders.  Hence, as counsel for the Government put it at our hearing, \"in Switzerland immigration is a particularly sensitive subject\".  Against this background the Government are, understandably, afraid of creating a precedent and therefore emphasise - rightly - that what is at stake is their right to control the entry of non-nationals into their territory and that, accordingly, we should leave them a wide margin of appreciation.  In this context they stress that they have only granted the applicant and his wife a temporary residence permit on humanitarian grounds, that as a consequence of that generosity they have already to bear the costs of subsistence of the applicant, his wife and their daughter Nursal and that it is therefore asking too much to expect them to do the same for Ersin. \r\n12.   So much for the one scale of the balance.  What lies in the other?  First and foremost, of course, a fundamental element of an elementary human right, the right to care for your own children.  It was only natural that the applicant and his wife, as soon as their residence situation was regularised, wanted their seven-year-old son to live with them.  There is a dispute as to Ersin’s living conditions, but I need not go deeply into that.  It suffices to note that the Government have not convincingly established that those conditions were satisfactory, let alone that, at the decisive moment, it was more in the interest of Ersin to remain in Turkey than to be reunited with his father and mother. \r\n13.   The Government do not argue that these are not weighty interests.  But they seek to diminish their relevance by contending that the applicant - on whom, they add, is the burden - has not shown that there are obstacles to re-establishing the family - father, mother and Ersin - in Turkey.  It is clear that the Government are thus relying on paragraph 68 of the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment.  However, they choose to ignore the fact that the Court, in the first sentence of that paragraph, explicitly distinguishes \"the present proceedings\" - i.e. the cases of the three wives that were before the Court - from the case of \"immigrants who already had a family which they left behind in another country until they had achieved settled status in the United Kingdom\" (= the country of settlement).\r\nThat is an important proviso, for it strongly suggests that in a case of \"immigrants who already had a family which they left behind\" - such as the present applicant - different norms should be applied. \r\n14.   Which norms?  The Court does not answer that question, but it is natural to infer that it intended to make it clear that in respect of such cases it might possibly hold that, in the context of the issue of family reunion, the State of settlement should respect the choice of the immigrants who have achieved settled status there and, accordingly, must accept members of their family which they had left behind for settlement.\r\nIn other words, contrary to the Government’s suggestion, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment is no authority for their allegation that Switzerland may refuse Ersin entry - although he is a member of the family which the applicant and his wife left behind - on the mere ground that if the applicant and his wife want family reunion they should go back to Turkey, there being a violation of Switzerland’s obligations under Article 8 (art. 8) only if the applicant proves that there are obstacles to doing so or other special reasons why that could not be expected of him.\r\nOn the contrary, the Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali judgment supports the proposition that in cases where a father and mother have achieved settled status in a country and want to be reunited with their child which for the time being they have left behind in their country of origin, it is per se unreasonable, if not inhumane to give them the choice between giving up the position which they have acquired in the country of settlement or to renounce the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other’s company which constitutes a fundamental element of family life. \r\n15.   It remains, of course, to be considered whether the latter principle applies in the present case, where the applicant has not \"achieved settled status\" in Switzerland, in so far as he and his wife have not been granted a \"settlement permit\", but have to base their right of residence on a permit which has, in principle, a temporary character and, consequently, a lower legal status than a settlement permit.\r\nIt cannot be denied that, from a point of view of State interest - that is from a point of view of immigration and residence - there is a good case for answering this question in the negative.  However, the European Court of Human Rights has to ensure, in particular, that State interests do not crush those of an individual, especially in situations where political pressure - such as the growing dislike of immigrants in most member States - may inspire State authorities to harsh decisions. As we stressed in paragraph 29 of our aforementioned Berrehab judgment (see paragraph 4 above), the Court must examine cases like this not only from the point of view of immigration and residence, but also with regard to the mutual interests of the applicant, his wife and Ersin.\r\nWhether he came as a refugee (as we must presume (see paragraph 3 above)) or as a job seeker (as the Government allege), at the material time the applicant had been living in Switzerland for seven years and his wife for four years.  During these years he had been legally employed, apparently by the same employer, until an unspecified date in 1990 when he fell ill (see paragraph 7 of the Court’s judgment).  The Swiss authorities have taken this time element into consideration, since their decision to grant a residence permit was partly based on the time the applicant had been living in Switzerland (see paragraph 11 of the Court’s judgment).  Rightly so, for, generally speaking, it may be assumed that after a period of between three and five years immigrants become rooted in the country of settlement.  By then they have formed new social ties there and have definitively begun to adapt themselves to their new homeland.  In assessing the humaneness of the choice with which the Swiss authorities confronted the applicant and his wife this element, the fact that they have become integrated in their new homeland - an element which, incidentally, is closely connected with their private life - is of far more importance than the formal status of their permit.\r\nThere are some further, specific elements to be taken into account.\r\nThe first is that for the applicant and his wife the choice in question was not only between renouncing their son or renouncing the position which they had acquired in Switzerland, but also between renouncing their son Ersin or their little daughter Nursal who was being educated in a home in Switzerland and whose interests almost certainly would have required that she should be left behind.\r\nThe second is that the applicant’s wife is dependent on medical care which she can certainly get in Switzerland, whilst it is in debate to what extent, if at all, she will be able to get it in Turkey.\r\nThe third is that the mere fact that the Turkish authorities did not immediately arrest the applicant when he entered the country as a visitor does not imply that he would not get into trouble if he tried to settle there again on a permanent basis.\r\nThe fourth is that the applicant and his wife deserve compassion: whilst his wife had been suffering from epilepsy since 1982 and had a terrible accident in 1987, the applicant himself became disabled in 1990.\r\nUnder these circumstances it could not reasonably be required of the applicant and his wife that in order to be reunited with Ersin they should leave Switzerland and return to Turkey.\r\nIt follows that a proper balance was not achieved between the interests involved, that the refusal of the Swiss authorities is disproportionate and, as such, not necessary in a democratic society. I thus conclude that there was a violation of Article 8 (art. 8).\r\n",

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 21928/93)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n21 February 1996 \r\n \r\nIn the case of Hussain v. the United Kingdom ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\nMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\nMr \tF. GÖLCÜKLÜ,\r\nMr \tR. MACDONALD,\r\nMr \tA. SPIELMANN,\r\nMr \tN. VALTICOS,\r\nMrs E. PALM,\r\nMr \tF. BIGI,\r\nSir \tJohn FREELAND,\r\nMr \tP. JAMBREK,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 September 1995 and 26 January 1996, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.    The case was referred to the Court on 8 December 1994 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and on 23 December 1994 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\"the Government\"), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 21928/93) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 31 March 1993 by a Pakistani national, Mr Abed Hussain. The Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention. The Commission further sought a decision as to whether there had been a breach of Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention.\r\n2.    In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the case of Singh v. the United Kingdom (no. 56/1994/503/585) should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6) and that a joint hearing should be held. The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 January 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr N. Valticos, Mrs E. Palm, Mr F. Bigi and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 13 April 1995 and the applicant’s memorial on 18 April. The Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\r\n5.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 September 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government\r\n\t\tMr I. CHRISTIE, Foreign and Commonwealth Office,\tAgent,\r\n\t\tMr D. PANNICK QC, Mr M. Shaw, Barrister-at-Law,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr H. CARTER, Mr H. BAYNE, Mr R. HARRINGTON,\r\n\t\tHome Office,\tAdvisers,\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr N. BRATZA, \tDelegate,\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\n\t\tMr E. FITZGERALD QC, Mr J. COOPER, Barrister-at-Law,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMs K. AKESTER,\tSolicitor.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Pannick.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n6.   Mr Abed Hussain was born in 1962 and is currently detained in Lindholme prison.\r\n7.   On 12 December 1978, the applicant - then aged 16 - was convicted at Leeds Crown Court of the murder of his younger brother, aged 2. The applicant had inflicted severe injuries on the infant while looking after him. He received a mandatory sentence of detention \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" pursuant to section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) (see paragraph 23 below). Its effect was to render the applicant \"liable to be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State [for the Home Department] may direct\".\r\n8.   In passing sentence on the applicant, the judge stated:\r\n\"I regard you as someone who has demonstrated himself tobe a cruel and unfeeling young man. I think you are -certainly for the time being - a dangerous person.\"\r\nThe applicant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on 5 March 1980.\r\n9.   Mr Hussain was first detained in the youth wing of Liverpool prison and then in a young offenders’ institution before being transferred to an adult prison.\r\n10.   Under the administrative procedures governing such sentences as that received by the applicant, a \"tariff\" period is set to fix the number of years’ detention necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence (see paragraph 27 below). In this regard, in 1978 the trial judge wrote to the Secretary of State:\r\n\"Over the two or three days immediately preceding thebaby’s death, [the applicant] had undoubtedly treated himwith very considerable violence by slapping, kicking andshaking. The baby was covered with over 60 bruises andhis brain and spine were injured. Since [the applicant]denied ever having laid hands on him, it was not possibleto discover why he had acted with such violence. [The applicant] is unquestionably an unscrupulous youngliar, but the most unusual feature of him was hisimpassivity. He demonstrated no feeling whatsoever forhis brother’s injuries and death. This gave me the impression that he is very probably avery dangerous young man who is quite unmoved bybrutality. I am anxious that this aspect of hischaracter should be borne fully in mind whenever thequestion of release arises. He still has three youngsiblings and their safety must be a predominantconsideration. I am deeply concerned at the appearanceof normality this young man gives; it is probably verymisleading. I cannot recommend any period for his detention. It willhave to continue until one can say with reasonablecertainty that maturation has rendered him safe. Thedifficulty is that he is already `old for his years’, asone police officer described him. Maturation hereinvolves much more than simply a young boy growing up.I can do no more than sound this sombre note of warning.\"\r\n11.   It was not until 1986 that the applicant’s tariff was set, at fifteen years, by the Secretary of State after a confidential process of consultation involving the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice. In the course of this process, in which the applicant had no sight of any of the documents, the trial judge recommended a period of ten years \"in view of the young age of [the] prisoner at the time of the offence\"; the Lord Chief Justice agreed but stated that this should be \"the absolute minimum\". However, the Secretary of State commented: \"I cannot accept the judicial tariff as matching the gravity of one of the most appalling offences I have encountered.\"\r\nHe accordingly increased the proposed tariff by five years. The applicant first learnt about these details through a letter from the Home Office of 6 October 1994, sent in accordance with the House of Lords’ judgment of 24 June 1993 (see paragraph 30 below).\r\n12.   In the course of the applicant’s detention the Parole Board (see paragraph 37 below) has so far considered whether or not to recommend the applicant’s release on four occasions.\r\n13.   The first Parole Board review took place in December 1986. The reports of progress were positive and, as later disclosed to the applicant:\r\n\"the Local Review Committee [see paragraph 38 below], whofelt that the risk was acceptable, considered Mr Hussain suitable to be given a provisional release date.\"\r\nThe Parole Board did not however recommend the applicant’s release but it did recommend that he be transferred to a less restrictive category C prison with a further review to commence in August 1990. At the time, the applicant did not see any of the reports before the Parole Board and had no opportunity to appear before it.\r\n14.   The second Parole Board review took place in 1990. A Home Office summary of the review, disclosed later to the applicant, stated:\r\n\"The Local Review Committee recommended that Mr Hussainshould be given a provisional release date ... The Board did not recommend Mr Hussain’s release, butrecommended his transfer to open conditions with afurther review to commence eighteen months thereafter.However, the Secretary of State rejected the Board’srecommendation and directed that he should move toanother category C prison with a further review tocommence in October 1992.\"\r\nAgain the applicant did not see any of the reports on him and was afforded no hearing before the Parole Board. He was given no reasons for the decisions taken.\r\n15.   In the third review in December 1992, the Parole Board recommended that the applicant be transferred to open conditions with a further review in six months’ time. However, the Secretary of State, in exercise of his statutory powers (see paragraph 29 below), rejected this recommendation, directing that the applicant remain in close conditions with a further review to commence in March 1995. The applicant was only informed in March 1993 that his release had not been recommended and about the date of his next review.\r\n16.   In June 1993, Mr Hussain applied for judicial review (see paragraph 39 below) in respect of the decision communicated in March 1993 on the basis that he had not been shown the reports on him placed before the Board. He relied on the case of Prem Singh (see paragraph 24 below) as establishing that persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure had a right at common law to disclosure of reports.\r\n17.   On 13 October 1993, the Parole Board gave the High Court an undertaking to reconsider the applicant’s case immediately and to disclose their case file to him so that he could make informed representations. The applicant withdrew his application for judicial review.\r\n18.   At his most recent review in January 1994, the applicant was shown the reports on him that were before the Parole Board but he was not given an opportunity to appear in person before the Board. Following this review, the Secretary of State accepted the Parole Board’s recommendation to transfer the applicant to open-prison conditions, which transfer took place in February 1994. The Parole Board will again consider the applicant’s case in February 1996.\r\n19.   The applicant has been detained for over seventeen years.\r\nII. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\nA. Categorisation of detention in the case of murderers\r\n20.   A person who unlawfully kills another with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm is guilty of murder. English law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder: \"detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" if the offender is under the age of 18 (section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) - see paragraph 23 below); \"custody for life\" if the offender is between 18 and 20 years old (section 8 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982); and \"life imprisonment\" for an offender aged 21 or over (section 1 (1) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965).\r\nMandatory life sentences are fixed by law in contrast to discretionary life sentences, which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences (for example manslaughter, rape, robbery). The principles underlying the passing of a discretionary life sentence are:\r\n(i) that the offence is grave and\r\n(ii) that there are exceptional circumstances which demonstrate that the offender is a danger to the public and that it is not possible to say when that danger will subside.\r\nDiscretionary life sentences are indeterminate so that \"the prisoner’s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody only so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large\" (R. v. Wilkinson [1983] 5 Criminal Appeal Reports 105, 108).\r\nB. Detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure\r\n21.   The notion of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has its origins in statutory form in an Act of 1800 for \"the safe custody of insane persons charged with offences\" (Criminal Lunatics Act), which provided that defendants acquitted of a charge of murder, treason or felony on the grounds of insanity at the time of the offence were to be detained in \"strict custody until His Majesty’s pleasure shall be known\" and described their custody as being \"during His [Majesty’s] pleasure\".\r\n22.   In 1908, detention during His Majesty’s pleasure was introduced in respect of offenders aged between 10 and 16. It was extended to cover those under the age of 18 at the time of conviction (1933) and further extended to cover persons under the age of 18 at the time when the offence was committed (1948).\r\n23.   The provision in force at present is section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) (\"the 1933 Act\") which provides:\r\n\"A person convicted of an offence who appears to thecourt to have been under the age of eighteen years at thetime the offence was committed shall not, if he isconvicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment forlife, nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on orrecorded against any such person; but in lieu thereof thecourt shall ... sentence him to be detained during HerMajesty’s pleasure and, if so sentenced he shall beliable to be detained in such a place and under suchconditions as the Secretary of State may direct.\"\r\n24.   In the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (20 April 1993, unreported) Lord Justice Evans in the Divisional Court held as follows in respect of detention \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\":\r\n\"At the time of sentencing, the detention orders undersection 53 were mandatory. It is indeed the statutoryequivalent for young persons of the mandatory lifesentence for murder. But the sentence itself is closerin substance to the discretionary sentence of which partis punitive (retribution and deterrence) and the balancejustified only by the interests of public safety when thetest of dangerousness is satisfied. The fact that themandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights asregards release on licence does not alter the fact thatthe mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishmentfor the whole of its period: see R. v. Secretary of StateEx. p. Doody & Others [1993] Q.B. 157 and Wynne v. UK(E.C.H.R. 1st December 1992). The order for detentionunder section 53 is by its terms both discretionary andindeterminate: it provides for detention `during HerMajesty’s pleasure’... I would decide the present case onthe narrow ground that, notwithstanding Home Office andParole Board practice, the applicant should be regardedas equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for thepurpose of deciding whether Wilson rather than Paynegoverns his case.\"\r\n (transcript, pp. 24C-25B)\r\nThe court accordingly held that the applicant in the case, detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure, should be afforded the same opportunity as would be given to a discretionary life prisoner to see the material before the Parole Board when it decided whether he should be released after his recall to prison on revocation of his licence.\r\nThe Parole Board has changed its policy accordingly.\r\n25.   However, in a statement in Parliament made on 27 July 1993 (see paragraph 32 below), the Secretary of State, Mr Michael Howard, explained that he included in the category of \"mandatory life sentence prisoners\" those\r\n\"persons who are, or will be, detained during HerMajesty’s pleasure under section 53 (1) of the Childrenand Young Persons Act 1933 ...\"\r\n26.   In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte T. and Others [1994] Queen’s Bench 378, 390D, Lord Justice Kennedy in the Divisional Court (with whom Mr Justice Pill agreed) said:\r\n\"I see no reason to regard him as having any specialstatus because he was sentenced to detention [during HerMajesty’s pleasure] rather than to life imprisonment,despite what was said by Evans LJ when giving judgment inReg. v. Parole Board, ex parte Singh (Prem)(20 April 1993, unreported). The issues in that casewere very different from those with which we areconcerned. If Hickey had not been sent to hospital hecould hope to benefit from the provisions ofsection 35 (2) of the 1991 Act [on mandatory lifeprisoners] ... It will be recalled that in Hickey’s casethe offence was murder, so the sentence was mandatory notdiscretionary.\"\r\nOn appeal the Court of Appeal stated that in respect of a person sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure under section 53 (1) of the 1933 Act for the offence of murder, the relevant provisions on release were those in section 35 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (see paragraph 29 below), and not those relating to a discretionary life prisoner (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hickey [1995] 1 All England Law Reports 479, 488).\r\nC. Release on licence\r\n27. Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment, custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure have a \"tariff\" set in relation to that period of imprisonment they should serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. After the expiry of the tariff, the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence. Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change in recent years, in particular following the coming into force on 1 October 1992 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\"the 1991 Act\").\r\n1. General procedure\r\n28.   Section 61 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (\"the 1967 Act\") provided, inter alia, that the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge, may \"release on licence a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for life or custody for life or a person detained under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933\". In this respect no difference was made between discretionary and mandatory life prisoners.\r\n29.   By virtue of section 35 (2) of the 1991 Act, persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure and those life prisoners who are not discretionary life prisoners (see paragraph 20 above), may be released on licence by the Secretary of State, if recommended to do so by the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge. The decision on whether to release still lies, therefore, with the Secretary of State.\r\n30.   The Secretary of State also decides the length of a prisoner’s tariff. Subsequently to a House of Lords judgment of 24 June 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 Appeal Cases 531, 567G), the view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State who then proceeds to fix the tariff. Where the Secretary of State decides to depart from the judicial recommendation he is obliged to give reasons. As a matter of practice the prisoner is informed of the Secretary of State’s final decision.\r\nIn the second, post-punitive phase of detention the prisoner knows that \"the penal consequence of his crime has been exhausted\" (ibid., 557A).\r\n31.   A statement of policy issued by Sir Leon Brittan, then Secretary of State for the Home Department, on 13 November 1983 indicated that release on licence following expiry of the tariff depended on whether the person was considered no longer to pose a risk to the public.\r\n32.   On 27 July 1993 the Secretary of State, Mr Michael Howard, made a statement of policy in relation to mandatory life prisoners, stating, inter alia, that before any such prisoner is released on licence he\r\n\"will consider not only, (a) whether the period served bythe prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements ofretribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe torelease the prisoner, but also (c) the publicacceptability of early release. This means that I willonly exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfiedthat to do so will not threaten the maintenance of publicconfidence in the system of criminal justice\".\r\n33.   In a number of recent court cases involving persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure, it has been stated that the correct test for post-tariff detention was to be whether the offender continued to constitute a danger to the public (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Cox, 3 September 1991; R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh, 20 April 1993 - cited above at paragraph 24; R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (no. 2), 16 March 1995).\r\n2. Procedure applicable to discretionary life prisoners\r\n34.   The 1991 Act instituted changes to the regime applying to the release of discretionary life prisoners following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A).\r\n35.   Pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 Act, the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is now fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After the tariff has expired, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined. Pursuant to the Parole Board Rules 1992 which came into force on 1 October 1992, a prisoner is entitled to an oral hearing, to disclosure of all evidence before the panel (see paragraph 37 below) and to legal representation. There is provision enabling a prisoner to apply to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross-examine those who have written reports about him.\r\n36.   For the purposes of the 1991 Act, persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure are not regarded as discretionary life prisoners (section 43 (2)).\r\nD. Parole Board and Local Review Committees\r\n37.   Section 59 of the 1967 Act set out the constitution and functions of the Parole Board:\r\n\"(1) For the purposes of exercising the functionconferred on it by this Part of this Act as respectsEngland and Wales there shall be a body known as theParole Board ... consisting of a chairman and not lessthan four other members appointed by the Secretary ofState.\r\n...\r\n(4) The following provisions shall have effect withrespect to the proceedings of the Board on any casereferred to it, that is to say\r\n(a) the Board shall deal with the case onconsideration of any documents given to it by theSecretary of State and of any reports it has calledfor and any information whether oral or in writingthat it has obtained; and\r\n(b) if in any particular case the Board thinks it isnecessary to interview the persons to whom the caserelates before reaching a decision, the Board mayrequest one of its members to interview him andshall take into account the report of that interviewby that member ...\r\n(5) The documents to be given by the Secretary of Stateto the Board under the last foregoing subsection shallinclude\r\n(a) where the case referred to the Board is one ofrelease under section 60 or 61 of this Act, anywritten representations made by the person to whomthe case relates in connection with or since hislast interview in accordance with rules under thenext following subsection;\r\n(b) where the case so referred relates to a person recalled under section 62 of this Act, any written representations made under that section.\"\r\nAs to the constitution of the Parole Board, Schedule 2 to the 1967 Act further provides:\r\n\"1. The Parole Board shall include among its members\r\n(a) a person who holds or has held judicial office;\r\n(b) a registered medical practitioner who is apsychiatrist;\r\n(c) a person appearing to the Secretary of State tohave knowledge and experience of the supervision orafter care of discharged prisoners;\r\n(d) a person appearing to the Secretary of State tohave made a study of the causes of delinquency orthe treatment of offenders.\"\r\nThe Parole Board always counts among its members three High Court judges, three circuit judges and a recorder. Cases referred to the Board may be dealt with by three or more members of the Board (Parole Board Rules 1967). In practice, the Board sits in small panels, including, in the case of life prisoners, a High Court judge and a psychiatrist. The judges on the Board are appointed by the Home Secretary (section 59 (1) of the 1967 Act) after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice. With the exception of the new rules concerning discretionary life prisoners, similar provisions apply under the 1991 Act.\r\n38.   Under section 59 (6) of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State established for every prison a Local Review Committee with the function of advising him on the suitability for release on licence of prisoners. It was the practice to obtain this assessment before referring a case to the Parole Board. Before the Local Review Committee reviewed a case, a member of the committee would interview the prisoner if he was willing to be interviewed. The first review by the Local Review Committee was normally fixed to take place three years before the expiry of the tariff. Local Review Committees were abolished by the Parole Board Rules 1992. The prisoner is now interviewed by a member of the Parole Board.\r\nE. Judicial review\r\n39.   Persons serving a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure may institute proceedings in the High Court to obtain judicial review of any decision of the Parole Board or of the Secretary of State if those decisions are taken in breach of the relevant statutory requirements or if they are otherwise tainted by illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety (Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1984] 3 All England Law Reports 935, 950-51).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n40.   Mr Hussain applied to the Commission on 31 March 1993. He relied on Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention, complaining that, under the current regulations:\r\n(a) he had no right to a periodic review by a court ofhis continued detention;\r\n(b) the ultimate decision as to his release lay with theexecutive;\r\n(c) he had no right to an oral hearing or to question orcall witnesses;\r\n(d) he had no acknowledged right to see the reportsbefore the Parole Board.\r\nThe applicant further complained under Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention that he had been irrationally discriminated against on the basis of his status as a person convicted of murder.\r\n41.   The Commission declared the application (no. 21928/93) admissible on 30 June 1994. In its report of 11 October 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it concluded, unanimously, that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) as regards the lack of review by a court of the applicant’s continued detention and that it was not necessary to examine the issues under Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention.\r\nThe full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment \r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT\r\n42.   At the hearing, the Agent of the Government invited the Court to conclude that, in the present case, there had been no breach of the Convention. The applicant, for his part, asked the Court to uphold his complaints and declare that his rights under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) had been violated, both by the denial of a review by a court-like body and by the denial at any time of an oral hearing at which he could have put his case for release in person.\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   SCOPE OF THE CASE\r\n43.   In his memorial to the Court and at the hearing the applicant complained of the secretive and unfair manner in which his tariff (see paragraph 27 above) had been established.\r\n44.   The Court notes that this particular complaint was not dealt with by the Commission in its report or admissibility decision and that, as pointed out by the Delegate of the Commission, it is uncertain whether it can be regarded as falling within the compass of the case before the Court as delimited by the Commission’s decision on admissibility (see, inter alia, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 13, para. 29). In any event, given the fact that the applicant’s punitive period has now expired, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint. The scope of the case before the Court is therefore confined to the issues under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) raised in connection with the applicant’s current situation, that is post-tariff detention.\r\nII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 4 (art. 5-4) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n45.   Mr Hussain complained that he had not been able at reasonable intervals to have the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure (see paragraph 20 above) heard by a court. He invoked Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention which provides:\r\n\"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest ordetention shall be entitled to take proceedings by whichthe lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedilyby a court and his release ordered if the detention isnot lawful.\"\r\n46.   The Court will first examine whether, having regard to the particular features of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) are satisfied by the original trial and appeal proceedings or, on the contrary, whether that provision (art. 5-4) confers an additional right to challenge the lawfulness of the continued detention before a court.\r\nA. Whether the requisite judicial control was incorporated in the original conviction\r\n47.   In the applicant’s submission, a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure differed from the mandatory life sentence imposed on adults (see paragraph 20 above), which the Court examined in its Wynne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 July 1994 (Series A no. 294-A), in that the former is not solely based on the gravity of the offence but takes into account the age of the offender. The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes. In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive.\r\nIn support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 21 and 23 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose. He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (\"a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life\" - see paragraph 23 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (\"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\").\r\nIn view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence. As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76). This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence. It follows that at that phase in the execution of his sentence, the applicant was entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention determined by a court at reasonable intervals.\r\n48.   The Commission agreed in substance with the applicant’s submissions and added that the absence of the word \"life\" in the sentence reinforced its indeterminate character. The Commission further noted the trial judge’s comments with regard to the dangerousness of the applicant (see paragraph 8 above).\r\n49.   The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness. This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above). Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 32 above).\r\nIt was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults. In these circumstances, the issues in the present case were practically identical to those in the Wynne case (cited above at paragraph 47) where the Court found that the original trial and appeal proceedings satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.\r\n50.   The Court notes at the outset that, as has been commonly accepted, the central issue in the present case is whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment. In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 34) or to that in the more recent case of Wynne v. the United Kingdom (cited at paragraph 47).\r\n51.   It is true, as submitted by the Government, that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is mandatory: it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion. It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 25 and 29 above).\r\nOn the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word \"life\" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence.\r\n52.   Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\r\n53.   It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence. In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. However an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public.\r\nThese considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older. A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.\r\n54.   Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence. This was, albeit in a different context, the view expressed by the Divisional Court in its judgment of 20 April 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh - see paragraph 24 above).\r\nThe decisive ground for the applicant’s continued detention was and continues to be his dangerousness to society, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time. Accordingly, new issues of lawfulness may arise in the course of detention and the applicant is entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to take proceedings to have these issues decided by a court at reasonable intervals (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 76).\r\nB. Whether the available remedies satisfied therequirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)\r\n55.   The Government accepted that if, contrary to their submissions, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) did confer additional rights to challenge the lawfulness of the applicant’s continued detention, there would have been a breach of that provision (art. 5-4) but only to the extent that the Parole Board had no general power to order the release of the applicant after the expiry of his tariff. In reply to the applicant’s submission that the importance and the nature of the issue, that is the detainee’s mental state, called for an oral hearing, including the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses, the Government recalled that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not confer an absolute right to an adversarial procedure and that to the extent that fairness did require an oral hearing, this could be secured by bringing judicial review proceedings.\r\n56.   The Commission found that the Parole Board’s lack of decision-making power meant that it could not be regarded as a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4). As to the need for an oral hearing, the Delegate of the Commission added that judicial review \"is a very uncertain remedy given the fact that express provision is made for an oral hearing in the case of discretionary life prisoners, but not in the case of persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure\".\r\n57.   The Court recalls that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not guarantee a right to judicial control of such scope as to empower the \"court\" on all aspects of the case, including questions of expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority; the review should, nevertheless, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which, according to the Convention, are essential for the lawful detention of a person subject to the special type of deprivation of liberty ordered against the applicant (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Weeks judgment, p. 29, para. 59, the E. v. Norway judgment of 29 August 1990, Series A no. 181-A, p. 21, para. 50, and the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 79).\r\n58.   As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraph 24 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4). Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government. However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\r\n59.   The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow v. Austria judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-B, p. 45, para. 67).\r\n60.   The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.\r\n61.   It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review. In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about. In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.\r\nC. Recapitulation\r\n62.   In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that the applicant, after the expiry of his tariff, was unable to bring the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure before a court with the powers and procedural guarantees satisfying that provision (art. 5-4).\r\nIII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 14 (art. 14) OF THECONVENTION\r\n63.   Neither in his written memorial nor in his oral pleading before the Court did the applicant make any reference to his complaint under Article 14 (art. 14), which had been declared admissible by the Commission (see paragraph 41 above). In these circumstances, and since no separate issues appear to arise under that provision (art. 14), the Court sees no reason to entertain it of its own motion.\r\nIV.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n64.   Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides as follows:\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken bya legal authority or any other authority of a HighContracting Party is completely or partially in conflictwith the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of thisdecision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, ifnecessary, afford just satisfaction to the injuredparty.\"\r\nThe applicant’s claims under this provision (art. 50) were for compensation for non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of legal costs and expenses referable to the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\r\nA. Non-pecuniary damage\r\n65.   The applicant sought compensation for the slow pace at which he has progressed towards liberty over the last seventeen years and, alternatively, for the loss of an opportunity to have his case examined by a fair and independent tribunal and the prejudice, anxiety and delay that this loss has caused him. He made a claim of £50,000 on the basis that he had had to serve some five years of additional detention because of the violation of his rights under the Convention.\r\n66.   In the opinion of the Court, there is no evidence that the applicant would have regained his freedom had Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) not been breached. Even assuming that he may have suffered some \"anxiety\", the Court shares the Government’s view that, in the circumstances, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50).\r\nB. Costs and expenses\r\n67.   For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £32,459.58 inclusive of value added tax.\r\n68.   The Government found the sum claimed excessive.\r\n69.   In the light of the criteria emerging from its case-law, the Court holds that the applicant should be awarded the amount of £19,000 less 14,475 French francs already paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees and travel and subsistence expenses.\r\nC. Default interest\r\n70.   According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.   Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that theapplicant, after the expiry of his punitive period, wasunable to bring the case of his continued detentionbefore a court;\r\n\r\n2.   Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaintunder Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention;\r\n\r\n3.   Holds that the present judgment constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage sustained;\r\n\r\n4.   Holds\r\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, in respect of legal costs andexpenses, £19,000 (nineteen thousand pounds sterling), less 14,475 (fourteen thousand four hundred andseventy-five) French francs already paid by way of legalaid, to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment;\r\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 8% shallbe payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\r\n\r\n5.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for justsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 February 1996.\r\n\r\nROLV RYSSDAL\r\n\t\t\tPresident\r\nHERBERT PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\n\r\n",

The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 11 December 1995, within the three month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in three applications (nos. 21627/93, 21826/93 and 21974/93) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 14 December 1992 by three British nationals, Mr Colin Laskey, Mr Roland Jaggard and Mr Anthony Brown.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8).\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the late Mr Laskey’s father and the two other applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 8 February 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr L. Wildhaber, Mr P. Kuris and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\"the Government\"), the applicants’ lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s and the applicants’ memorials on 2 and 15 July 1996 respectively.\r\n5.   On 17 July 1996, the President granted leave to Rights International, a New York-based non-governmental human rights organisation, to submit written comments on specified aspects of the case (Rule 37 para. 2). The comments were received on 16 August 1996.\r\n6.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 October 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government\r\nMr I. CHRISTIE, Assistant Legal Adviser,\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office,\tAgent,\r\nMr D. PANNICK QC,\r\nMr M. SHAW,\tCounsel,\r\nMr S. BRAMLEY,\r\nMs B. MOXON,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\nMr G. RESS,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicants\r\nLord LESTER OF HERNE HILL QC,\r\nMs A. WORRALL QC,\tCounsel,\r\nMr D. JONAS,\r\nMr A. HAMILTON,\r\nMr I. GEFFEN,\tSolicitors,\r\nMr J. WADHAM,\tAdviser.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Ress, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, Ms Worrall and Mr Pannick.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n7.   Mr Laskey, Mr Jaggard and Mr Brown, all British citizens, were born in 1943, 1947 and 1935 respectively. Mr Laskey died on 14 May 1996.\r\n8.   In 1987, in the course of routine investigations into other matters, the police came into possession of a number of video films which were made during sado-masochistic encounters involving the applicants and as many as forty-four other homosexual men. As a result the applicants, with several other men, were charged with a series of offences, including assault and wounding, relating to sado-masochistic activities that had taken place over a ten-year period. One of the charges involved a defendant who was not yet 21 years old - the age of consent to male homosexual practices at the time. Although the instances of assault were very numerous, the prosecution limited the counts to a small number of exemplary charges.\r\nThe acts consisted in the main of maltreatment of the genitalia (with, for example, hot wax, sandpaper, fish hooks and needles) and ritualistic beatings either with the assailant’s bare hands or a variety of implements, including stinging nettles, spiked belts and a cat-o’-nine tails. There were instances of branding and infliction of injuries which resulted in the flow of blood and which left scarring.\r\nThese activities were consensual and were conducted in private for no apparent purpose other than the achievement of sexual gratification. The infliction of pain was subject to certain rules including the provision of a code word to be used by any \"victim\" to stop an \"assault\", and did not lead to any instances of infection, permanent injury or the need for medical attention.\r\n9.   The activities took place at a number of locations, including rooms equipped as torture chambers. Video cameras were used to record events and the tapes copied and distributed amongst members of the group. The prosecution was largely based on the contents of those videotapes. There was no suggestion that the tapes had been sold or used other than by members of the group.\r\n10.   The applicants pleaded guilty to the assault charges after the trial judge ruled that they could not rely on the consent of the \"victims\" as an answer to the prosecution case.\r\n11.   On 19 December 1990, the defendants were convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. On passing sentence, the trial judge commented: \"... the unlawful conduct now before the court would be dealt with equally in the prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out by them. The homosexuality of the defendants is only the background against which the case must be viewed.\"\r\nMr Laskey was sentenced to imprisonment for four years and six months. This included a sentence of four years’ imprisonment for aiding and abetting keeping a disorderly house (see paragraph 31 below) and a consecutive term of six months’ imprisonment for possession of an indecent photograph of a child. Under section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (\"the 1861 Act\" - see paragraph 27 below), Mr Laskey also received concurrent sentences of twelve months’ imprisonment in respect of various counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm.\r\n12.   Mr Jaggard was sentenced to imprisonment for three years. He received two years’ imprisonment for aiding and abetting unlawful wounding - contrary to section 20 of the 1861 Act (see paragraph 25 below) -, and a further twelve months’ imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, aiding and abetting the same offence, and unlawful wounding.\r\n13.   Mr Brown was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and nine months. He received twelve months’ imprisonment for aiding and abetting assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a further nine months’ imprisonment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and a further twelve months’ imprisonment for further assaults occasioning actual bodily harm.\r\n14.   The applicants appealed against conviction and sentence.\r\n15.   On 19 February 1992, the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, dismissed the appeals against conviction. Since, however, the court found that the applicants did not appreciate that their actions in inflicting injuries were criminal, reduced sentences were imposed.\r\n16.   Mr Laskey’s sentence was thus reduced to eighteen months’ imprisonment as regards the charge of aiding and abetting keeping a disorderly house. This sentence was to run concurrently with another three months’ sentence in respect of the various counts of assault and consecutively with six months’ imprisonment for the possession of an indecent photograph of a child, totalling two years’ imprisonment.\r\n17.   Mr Jaggard’s and Mr Brown’s sentences were reduced to six months’ and three months’ imprisonment respectively.\r\n18.   The applicants appealed to the House of Lords on the following certified point of law of public importance:\r\n\"Where A wounds or assaults B occasioning him actual bodily harm in the course of a sado-masochistic encounter, does the prosecution have to prove lack of consent on the part of B before they can establish A’s guilt under section 20 or section 47 of the 1861 Act?\"\r\n19.   On 11 March 1993, the appeal, known as the case of R. v. Brown ([1993] 2 All England Law Reports 75), was dismissed by a majority of the House of Lords, two of the five law lords dissenting.\r\n20.   Lord Templeman, in the majority, held after reviewing the case-law that:\r\n\"... the authorities dealing with the intentional infliction of bodily harm do not establish that consent is a defence to a charge under the Act of 1861. They establish that consent is a defence to the infliction of bodily harm in the course of some lawful activities. The question is whether the defence should be extended to the infliction of bodily harm in the course of sado-masochistic encounters ...\r\nCounsel for the appellants argued that consent should provide a defence ... because it was said every person has a right to deal with his own body as he chooses. I do not consider that this slogan provides a sufficient guide to the policy decision which must now be taken.  It is an offence for a person to abuse his own body and mind by taking drugs.  Although the law is often broken, the criminal law restrains a practice which is regarded as dangerous and injurious to individuals and which if allowed and extended is harmful to society generally. In any event the appellants in this case did not mutilate their own bodies. They inflicted harm on willing victims ...\r\nIn principle there is a difference between violence which is incidental and violence which is inflicted for the indulgence of cruelty. The violence of sado-masochistic encounters involves the indulgence of cruelty by sadists and the degradation of victims. Such violence is injurious to the participants and unpredictably dangerous. I am not prepared to invent a defence of consent for sado-masochistic encounters which breed and glorify cruelty ...\r\nSociety is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is uncivilised.\"\r\n21.   Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle found that:\r\n\"In my view the line falls properly to be drawn between assault at common law and the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm created by section 47 of the 1861 Act, with the result that consent of the victim is no answer to anyone charged with the latter offence ... unless the circumstances fall within one of the well known exceptions such as organised sporting contests or games, parental chastisement or reasonable surgery ... the infliction of actual or more serious bodily harm is an unlawful activity to which consent is no answer.\r\n... Notwithstanding the views which I have come to, I think it right to say something about the submissions that consent to the activity of the appellants would not be injurious to the public interest.\r\nConsiderable emphasis was placed by the appellants on the well-ordered and secret manner in which their activities were conducted and upon the fact that these activities had resulted in no injuries which required medical attention. There was, it was said, no question of proselytising by the appellants. This latter submission sits ill with the following passage in the judgment of the Lord Chief Justice:\r\n‘They [Laskey and Cadman] recruited new participants; they jointly organised proceedings at the house where much of this activity took place; where much of the pain inflicting equipment was stored.\r\nCadman was a voyeur rather than a sado-masochist, but both he and Laskey through their operations at the Horwich premises were responsible in part for the corruption of a youth \"K\" who is now it seems settled into a normal heterosexual relationship.’\r\nBe that as it may, in considering the public interest it would be wrong to look only at the activities of the appellants alone, there being no suggestion that they and their associates are the only practitioners of homosexual sado-masochism in England and Wales. This House must therefore consider the possibility that these activities are practised by others and by others who are not so controlled or responsible as the appellants are claiming to be. Without going into details of all the rather curious activities in which the appellants engaged it would appear to be good luck rather than good judgment which has prevented serious injury from occurring. Wounds can easily become septic if not properly treated, the free flow of blood from a person who is HIV-positive or who has AIDS can infect another and an inflicter who is carried away by sexual excitement or by drink or drugs could very easily inflict pain and injury beyond the level to which the receiver had consented. Your Lordships have no information as to whether such situations have occurred in relation to other sado masochistic practitioners. It was no doubt these dangers which caused Lady Mallalieu to restrict her propositions in relation to the public interest to the actual rather than the potential result of the activity. In my view such a restriction is quite unjustified. When considering the public interest potential for harm is just as relevant as actual harm. As Mathew J. said in Coney 8 Queen’s Bench 534, 547:\r\n‘There is however abundant authority for saying that no consent can render that innocent which is in fact dangerous.’\r\nFurthermore, the possibility of proselytisation and corruption of young men is a real danger even in the case of these appellants and the taking of video recordings of such activities suggests that secrecy may not be as strict as the appellants claimed to your Lordships.\"\r\n22.   Lord Mustill and Lord Slynn of Hadley dissented. The first considered that the case should not be treated as falling within the criminal law of violence but rather within the criminal law of private sexual relations. He gave weight to the arguments of the appellants concerning Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), finding that the decisions of the European authorities clearly favoured the right of the appellants to conduct their private life undisturbed by the criminal law. He considered after an examination of the relevant case-law that it was appropriate for the House of Lords to tackle afresh the question whether public interest required penalising the infliction of this degree of harm in private on a consenting recipient, where the purpose was not profit but gratification of sexual desire. He found no convincing argument on grounds of health (alleged risk of infections or spread of AIDS), the alleged risk of the activities getting out of hand or any possible risk of corruption of youth which might require the offences under the 1861 Act to be interpreted as applying to this conduct.\r\n23.   Lord Slynn of Hadley found that as the law stood adults were able to consent to acts done in private which did not result in serious bodily harm. He agreed that it was in the end a matter of policy in an area where social and moral factors were extremely important and where attitudes could change. It was however for the legislature to decide whether such conduct should be brought within the criminal law and not for the courts in the interests of \"paternalism\" to introduce into existing statutory crimes relating to offences against the person concepts which did not properly fit there.\r\n24.   The proceedings were given widespread press coverage. All the applicants lost their jobs and Mr Jaggard required extensive psychiatric treatment.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\nA. Offences against the persons\r\n1. The Offences against the Person Act 1861\r\n25.   Section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (\"the 1861 Act\") provides:\r\n\"Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument, ... shall be liable ... to [imprisonment] ... for not more than five years.\"\r\n26.   According to the case-law, to constitute a wound for the purposes of the section, the whole skin must be broken, not merely the outer layer or epidermis.\r\n27.   By section 47 of the 1861 Act:\r\n\"Whosoever shall be convicted on indictment of any assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable ... to imprisonment for not more than five years.\"\r\nActual bodily harm is defined as \"any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with health or comfort\" (Liksey J, in R. v. Miller [1954] 2 Queen’s Bench Reports 282, at 292).\r\n2. Case-law prior to R. v. Brown\r\n28.   In the case of R. v. Donovan ([1934] 2 King’s Bench Reports, at 498), the accused had beaten with a cane a girl for the purposes of sexual gratification, with her consent. Swift J held:\r\n\"It is an unlawful act to beat another person with such a degree of violence that the infliction of actual bodily harm is a probable consequence, and when such an act is proved, consent is immaterial.\"\r\n29.   In Attorney-General’s Reference (No. 6 of 1980) ([1980] Queen’s Bench Reports, at 715) where two men quarrelled and decided to fight each other, Lord Lane CJ in the Court of Appeal had held:\r\n\"It is not in the public interest that people should try to cause or should cause each other actual bodily harm for no good reason. Minor struggles are another matter. So, in our judgment, it is immaterial whether the act occurs in private or in public; it is an assault if actual bodily harm is intended and/or caused. This means that most fights will be unlawful regardless of consent. Nothing which we have said is intended to cast doubt upon the accepted legality of properly conducted games and sports, lawful chastisement or correction, reasonable surgical interference, dangerous exhibitions, etc. These apparent exceptions can be justified as involving the exercise of a legal right, in the case of chastisement or correction, or as needed in the public interest, in the other cases.\"\r\n3. Case-law subsequent to R. v. Brown\r\n30.   In R. v. Wilson ([1996] 3 Weekly Law Reports, at 125), where a man had been convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for having branded his initials with a hot knife on his wife’s buttocks with her consent, the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, allowed the appeal. In the course of the court’s judgment, Lord Justice Russell stated:\r\n\"... there is no factual comparison to be made between the instant case and the facts of either Donovan or Brown: Mrs Wilson not only consented to that which the appellant did, she instigated it.  There was no aggressive intent on the part of the appellant ...\r\n...\r\nWe do not think that we are entitled to assume that the method adopted by the appellant and his wife was any more dangerous or painful than tattooing ...\r\nConsensual activity between husband and wife, in the privacy of the matrimonial home, is not, in our judgment, a proper matter for criminal investigation, let alone criminal prosecution.\"\r\nB. Offences against public decency\r\n31.   Keeping a \"disorderly house\" is a common law offence. A disorderly house is defined as\r\n\"one which is not regulated by the restraints of morality and which is so conducted as to violate law and good order. There must be an element of ‘open house’, but it does not need to be open for the public at large ... Where indecent performances or exhibitions are alleged as rendering the premises a disorderly house, it must be proved that matters are there performed or exhibited of such a character that their performance or exhibition in a place of common resort (a) amounts to an outrage of public decency, or (b) tends to corrupt or deprave, or (c) is otherwise calculated to injure the public interest so as to call for condemnation and punishment\" ([1996] Archbold’s Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 20, at 224).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n32.   Mr Laskey, Mr Jaggard and Mr Brown applied to the Commission on 14 December 1992. They relied on Articles 7 and 8 of the Convention (art. 7, art. 8), complaining that their convictions were the result of an unforeseeable application of a provision of the criminal law which, in any event, amounted to an unlawful and unjustifiable interference with their right to respect for their private life.\r\n33.   On 18 January 1995, the Commission declared the applications (nos. 21627/93, 21826/93 and 21974/93) admissible as to the complaint under Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8). In its report of 26 October 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by eleven votes to seven, that there had been no violation of that provision (art. 8).\r\nThe full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n34.   At the hearing, the Government invited the Court to agree with the majority of the Commission that there had been no breach of the Convention in this case.\r\nThe applicants, for their part, asked the Court to consider the position of each individual applicant upon the basis of the agreed facts and the charges which were pertinent to them and to find a violation of their right to respect for their private lives through the expression of their sexual personality, as guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8).\r\nAS TO THE LAW \r\nALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 8)\r\n35.   The applicants contended that their prosecution and convictions for assault and wounding in the course of consensual sado-masochistic activities between adults was in breach of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), which provides:\r\n\"1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\r\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"\r\nIt was common ground among those appearing before the Court that the criminal proceedings against the applicants which resulted in their conviction constituted an \"interference by a public authority\" with the applicants’ right to respect for their private life. It was similarly undisputed that the interference had been \"in accordance with the law\". Furthermore, the Commission and the applicants accepted the Government’s assertion that the interference pursued the legitimate aim of the \"protection of health or morals\", within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8 2).\r\n36.   The Court observes that not every sexual activity carried out behind closed doors necessarily falls within the scope of Article 8 (art. 8). In the present case, the applicants were involved in consensual sado-masochistic activities for purposes of sexual gratification. There can be no doubt that sexual orientation and activity concern an intimate aspect of private life (see, mutatis mutandis, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, para. 52). However, a considerable number of people were involved in the activities in question which included, inter alia, the recruitment of new \"members\", the provision of several specially equipped \"chambers\", and the shooting of many videotapes which were distributed among the \"members\" (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above). It may thus be open to question whether the sexual activities of the applicants fell entirely within the notion of \"private life\" in the particular circumstances of the case.\r\nHowever, since this point has not been disputed by those appearing before it, the Court sees no reason to examine it of its own motion in the present case. Assuming, therefore, that the prosecution and conviction of the applicants amounted to an interference with their private life, the question arises whether such an interference was \"necessary in a democratic society\" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8-2).\r\n\"Necessary in a democratic society\"\r\n37.   The applicants maintained that the interference in issue could not be regarded as \"necessary in a democratic society\". This submission was contested by the Government and by a majority of the Commission.\r\n38.   In support of their submission, the applicants alleged that all those involved in the sado-masochistic encounters were willing adult participants; that participation in the acts complained of was carefully restricted and controlled and was limited to persons with like-minded sado-masochistic proclivities; that the acts were not witnessed by the public at large and that there was no danger or likelihood that they would ever be so witnessed; that no serious or permanent injury had been sustained, no infection had been caused to the wounds, and that no medical treatment had been required. Furthermore, no complaint was ever made to the police - who learnt about the applicants’ activities by chance (see paragraph 8 above).\r\nThe potential for severe injury or for moral corruption was regarded by the applicants as a matter of speculation. To the extent that issues of public morality had arisen - with reference to Mr Laskey’s conviction for keeping a disorderly house and for the possession of an indecent photograph of a child (see paragraph 11 above) - these had been dealt with under the relevant sexual offences provisions and appropriately punished. In any event, such issues fell outside the scope of the case as presented before the Court.\r\n39.   The applicants submitted that their case should be viewed as one involving matters of sexual expression, rather than violence. With due regard to this consideration, the line beyond which consent is no defence to physical injury should only be drawn at the level of intentional or reckless causing of serious disabling injury.\r\n40.   For the Government, the State was entitled to punish acts of violence, such as those for which the applicants were convicted, that could not be considered of a trifling or transient nature, irrespective of the consent of the victim. In fact, in the present case, some of these acts could well be compared to \"genital torture\" and a Contracting State could not be said to have an obligation to tolerate acts of torture because they are committed in the context of a consenting sexual relationship. The State was moreover entitled to prohibit activities because of their potential danger.\r\nThe Government further contended that the criminal law should seek to deter certain forms of behaviour on public-health grounds but also for broader moral reasons. In this respect, acts of torture - such as those in issue in the present case - may be banned also on the ground that they undermine the respect which human beings should confer upon each other. In any event, the whole issue of the role of consent in the criminal law is of great complexity and the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options.\r\n41.   The Commission noted that the injuries that were or could be caused by the applicants’ activities were of a significant nature and degree, and that the conduct in question was, on any view, of an extreme character. The State authorities therefore acted within their margin of appreciation in order to protect its citizens from real risk of serious physical harm or injury.\r\n42.   According to the Court’s established case-law, the notion of necessity implies that the interference corresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, that it is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued; in determining whether an interference is \"necessary in a democratic society\", the Court will take into account that a margin of appreciation is left to the national authorities (see, inter alia, the Olsson v. Sweden (no. 1) judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130, pp. 31-32, para. 67), whose decision remains subject to review by the Court for conformity with the requirements of the Convention.\r\nThe scope of this margin of appreciation is not identical in each case but will vary according to the context. Relevant factors include the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities concerned (see the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1291-92, para. 74).\r\n43.   The Court considers that one of the roles which the State is unquestionably entitled to undertake is to seek to regulate, through the operation of the criminal law, activities which involve the infliction of physical harm. This is so whether the activities in question occur in the course of sexual conduct or otherwise.\r\n44.   The determination of the level of harm that should be tolerated by the law in situations where the victim consents is in the first instance a matter for the State concerned since what is at stake is related, on the one hand, to public health considerations and to the general deterrent effect of the criminal law, and, on the other, to the personal autonomy of the individual.\r\n45.   The applicants have contended that, in the circumstances of the case, the behaviour in question formed part of private morality which is not the State’s business to regulate. In their submission the matters for which they were prosecuted and convicted concerned only private sexual behaviour.\r\nThe Court is not persuaded by this submission. It is evident from the facts established by the national courts that the applicants’ sado-masochistic activities involved a significant degree of injury or wounding which could not be characterised as trifling or transient. This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the present case from those applications which have previously been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was present (see the Dudgeon judgment cited above, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259).\r\n46.   Nor does the Court accept the applicants’ submission that no prosecution should have been brought against them since their injuries were not severe and since no medical treatment had been required.\r\nIn deciding whether or not to prosecute, the State authorities were entitled to have regard not only to the actual seriousness of the harm caused - which as noted above was considered to be significant - but also, as stated by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (see paragraph 21 above), to the potential for harm inherent in the acts in question. In this respect it is recalled that the activities were considered by Lord Templeman to be \"unpredictably dangerous\" (see paragraph 20 above).\r\n47.   The applicants have further submitted that they were singled out partly because of the authorities’ bias against homosexuals. They referred to the recent judgment in the Wilson case (see paragraph 30 above), where, in their view, similar behaviour in the context of a heterosexual couple was not considered to deserve criminal punishment.\r\nThe Court finds no evidence in support of the applicants’ allegations in either the conduct of the proceedings against them or the judgment of the House of Lords. In this respect it recalls the remark of the trial judge when passing sentence that \"the unlawful conduct now before the court would be dealt with equally in the prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out by them\" (see paragraph 11 above).\r\nMoreover, it is clear from the judgment of the House of Lords that the opinions of the majority were based on the extreme nature of the practices involved and not the sexual proclivities of the applicants (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).\r\nIn any event, like the Court of Appeal, the Court does not consider that the facts in the Wilson case were at all comparable in seriousness to those in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).\r\n48.   Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\r\n49.   It remains to be ascertained whether these measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim or aims pursued.\r\nThe Court notes that the charges of assault were numerous and referred to illegal activities which had taken place over more than ten years. However, only a few charges were selected for inclusion in the prosecution case. It further notes that, in recognition of the fact that the applicants did not appreciate their actions to be criminal, reduced sentences were imposed on appeal (see paragraphs 15-17 above). In these circumstances, bearing in mind the degree of organisation involved in the offences, the measures taken against the applicants cannot be regarded as disproportionate.\r\n50.   In sum, the Court finds that the national authorities were entitled to consider that the prosecution and conviction of the applicants were necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 8-2).\r\n51.   In view of this conclusion the Court, like the Commission, does not find it necessary to determine whether the interference with the applicants’ right to respect for private life could also be justified on the ground of the protection of morals.  This finding, however, should not be understood as calling into question the prerogative of the State on moral grounds to seek to deter acts of the kind in question.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\nHolds that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8).\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 19 February 1997.\r\n\r\nRudolf BERNHARDT\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the concurring opinion of Mr Pettiti is annexed to this judgment.\r\n\r\nR. B.\r\nH. P.  \r\n \r\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE PETTITI\r\n(Translation)\r\nI concurred with all my colleagues in finding that there had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8). However, my reasoning differs from theirs in some respects.\r\nFirstly, the Court implicitly accepted that Article 8 (art. 8) was applicable since it assumed there had been an interference, and the application referred to State interference under Article 8 (art. 8): \"the institution of criminal proceedings infringed that Article (art. 8).\"\r\nIn my view, that Article (art. 8) was not even applicable in the instant case.  The concept of private life cannot be stretched indefinitely.\r\nNot every aspect of private life automatically qualifies for protection under the Convention. The fact that the behaviour concerned takes place on private premises does not suffice to ensure complete immunity and impunity. Not everything that happens behind closed doors is necessarily acceptable. It is already the case in criminal law that the \"rape\" of a spouse where there is doubt whether consent was given may lead to prosecution. Other types of behaviour may give rise to civil proceedings (internal telephone tapping for example). Sexual acts and abuse, even when not criminal, give rise to liability.\r\nThe case could have been looked at differently, both in domestic law and subsequently under the Convention. Can one consider that adolescents taking part in sado-masochistic activities have given their free and informed consent where their elders have used various means of enticement, including financial reward?\r\nIn domestic law, sado-masochistic activities could be made the subject of a specific criminal offence without that being contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\r\nIt seems to me that the wording used by the Court in paragraph 42 is too vague. The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment (see Olivier de Schutter’s commentary on that judgment in Revue trimestrielle des droits de l’homme, Brussels, 1997, pp. 64-93).\r\nIt seemed to me necessary to expand paragraph 43 by noting \"to regulate and punish practices of sexual abuse that are demeaning even if they do not involve the infliction of physical harm\".\r\nThe dangers of unrestrained permissiveness, which can lead to debauchery, paedophilia (see paragraph 11 of the judgment) or the torture of others, were highlighted at the Stockholm World Conference. The protection of private life means the protection of a person’s intimacy and dignity, not the protection of his baseness or the promotion of criminal immoralism.\r\n",

Denmark,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting as a Grand Chamber pursuant to Rule 51 of the Rules of Court and composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tR. BERNHARDT,\r\n\tMr \tF. GÖLCÜKLÜ,\r\n\tMr \tR. MACDONALD,\r\n\tMr \tC. RUSSO,\r\n\tMr \tA. SPIELMANN,\r\n\tMr \tN. VALTICOS,\r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS,\r\n\tMrs \tE. PALM,\r\n\tMr \tR. PEKKANEN,\r\n\tMr \tA.N. LOIZOU,\r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\tMr \tM.A. LOPES ROCHA,\r\n\tMr\tL. WILDHABER,\r\n\tMr \tG. MIFSUD BONNICI,\r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK,\r\n\tMr \tD. GOTCHEV,\r\n\tMr \tB. REPIK,\r\n\tMr \tA. PHILIP, ad hoc judge,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Acting Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 22 April and 22 August 1994,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court on 9 September 1993 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and on 11 October 1993 by the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark (\"the Government\"), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\"). It originated in an application (no. 15890/89) against Denmark lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Danish national, Mr Jens Olaf Jersild, on 25 July 1989.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Denmark recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48). The object of the request and of the Government’s application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent him (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr I. Foighel, the elected judge of Danish nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). However, on 20 September 1993 Mr Foighel withdrew from the case pursuant to Rule 24 para. 2. On 24 September 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mrs E. Palm, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr J. Makarczyk and Mr D. Gotchev (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). By letter of 29 October the Agent of the Government notified the Registrar of the appointment of Mr K. Waaben as an ad hoc judge; in a letter of 16 November the Agent informed the Registrar that Mr Waaben had withdrawn and that they had therefore appointed Mr A. Philip to replace him (Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 23) (art. 43).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 18 February 1994 and the applicant’s memorial on 20 February. In a letter of 7 March the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to reply in writing.\r\n5.   On 23 February 1994 the President, having consulted the Chamber, had granted leave to Human Rights Watch, a New York based non-governmental human rights organisation, to submit observations on specific aspects of the case (Rule 37 para. 2). The latter’s comments were filed on 23 March.\r\nOn 23 February the Chamber had authorised (Rule 41 para. 1) the applicant to show the video-recording of the television programme in issue in his case to the judges taking part in the proceedings. A showing was held shortly before the hearing on 20 April.\r\n6.   On 23 February the Chamber had also decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51). The President and the Vice-President, Mr R. Bernhardt, as well as the other members of the Chamber being ex officio members of the Grand Chamber, the names of the additional nine judges were drawn by lot by the President in the presence of the Registrar on 24 February (Rule 51 para. 2 (a) to (c)), namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr C. Russo, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr N. Valticos, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr L. Wildhaber and Mr B. Repik.\r\n7.   On various dates between 22 March and 15 April 1994 the Commission produced a number of documents and two video-cassettes, as requested by the Registrar on the President’s instructions, and the applicant submitted further details on his claims under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention.\r\n8.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 April 1994. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n- for the Government\r\n\t\tMr T. LEHMANN, Ambassador,\r\n\t\t\tLegal Adviser, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \tAgent,\r\n\t\tMr M.B. ELMER, Deputy Permanent Secretary,\r\n\t\t\tChief Legal Adviser, Ministry of Justice,\r\n\t\tMs J. RECHNAGEL, Minister Counsellor,\r\n\t\t\tMinistry of Justice,\r\n\t\tMr J. LUNDUM, Head of Section, Ministry of Justice, \tAdvisers;\r\n- for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr C.L. ROZAKIS, \tDelegate;\r\n- for the applicant\r\n\t\tMr K. BOYLE, Barrister, Professor of Law\r\n\t\t\tat the University of Essex,\r\n\t\tMr T. TRIER, advokat, Lecturer of Law\r\n\t\t\tat the University of Copenhagen,  \tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMrs L. JOHANNESSEN, lawyer, \tAdviser.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Rozakis, Mr Lehmann, Mr Elmer, Mr Boyle and Mr Trier, and also replies to a question put by the President.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n9.   Mr Jens Olaf Jersild, a Danish national, is a journalist and lives in Copenhagen. He was at the time of the events giving rise to the present case, and still is, employed by Danmarks Radio (Danish Broadcasting Corporation, which broadcasts not only radio but also television programmes), assigned to its Sunday News Magazine (Søndagsavisen). The latter is known as a serious television programme intended for a well-informed audience, dealing with a wide range of social and political issues, including xenophobia, immigration and refugees.\r\nA. The Greenjackets item\r\n10.   On 31 May 1985 the newspaper Information published an article describing the racist attitudes of members of a group of young people, calling themselves \"the Greenjackets\" (\"grønjakkerne\"), at Østerbro in Copenhagen. In the light of this article, the editors of the Sunday News Magazine decided to produce a documentary on the Greenjackets. Subsequently the applicant contacted representatives of the group, inviting three of them together with Mr Per Axholt, a social worker employed at the local youth centre, to take part in a television interview. During the interview, which was conducted by the applicant, the three Greenjackets made abusive and derogatory remarks about immigrants and ethnic groups in Denmark. It lasted between five and six hours, of which between two and two and a half hours were video-recorded. Danmarks Radio paid the interviewees fees in accordance with its usual practice.\r\n11.   The applicant subsequently edited and cut the film of the interview down to a few minutes. On 21 July 1985 this was broadcast by Danmarks Radio as a part of the Sunday News Magazine. The programme consisted of a variety of items, for instance on the martial law in South Africa, on the debate on profit-sharing in Denmark and on the late German writer Heinrich Böll. The transcript of the Greenjackets item reads as follows [(I): TV presenter; (A): the applicant; (G): one or other of the Greenjackets]:\r\n(I)   \"In recent years, a great deal has been said about racism in Denmark. The papers are currently publishing stories about distrust and resentment directed against minorities. Who are the people who hate the minorities? Where do they come from? What is their mentality like? Mr Jens Olaf Jersild has visited a group of extremist youths at Østerbro in Copenhagen.\r\n(A)   The flag on the wall is the flag of the Southern States from the American Civil War, but today it is also the symbol of racism, the symbol of the American movement, the Ku Klux Klan, and it shows what Lille Steen, Henrik and Nisse are.\r\nAre you a racist?\r\n(G)   Yes, that’s what I regard myself as. It’s good being a racist. We believe Denmark is for the Danes.\r\n(A)   Henrik, Lille Steen and all the others are members of a group of young people who live in Studsgårdsgade, called STUDSEN, in Østerbro in Copenhagen. It is public housing, a lot of the inhabitants are unemployed and on social security; the crime rate is high. Some of the young people in this neighbourhood have already been involved in criminal activities and have already been convicted.\r\n(G)   It was an ordinary armed robbery at a petrol station.\r\n(A)   What did you do?\r\n(G)   Nothing. I just ran into a petrol station with a ... gun and made them give me some money. Then I ran out again. That’s all.\r\n(A)   What about you, what happened?\r\n(G)   I don’t wish to discuss that further.\r\n(A)   But, was it violence?\r\n(G)   Yes.\r\n(A)   You have just come out of ... you have been arrested, what were you arrested for?\r\n(G)   Street violence.\r\n(A)   What happened?\r\n(G)   I had a little fight with the police together with some friends.\r\n(A)   Does that happen often?\r\n(G)   Yes, out here it does.\r\n(A)   All in all, there are 20-25 young people from STUDSEN in the same group.\r\nThey meet not far away from the public housing area near some old houses which are to be torn down. They meet here to reaffirm among other things their racism, their hatred of immigrants and their support for the Ku Klux Klan.\r\n(G)   The Ku Klux Klan, that’s something that comes from the States in the old days during - you know - the civil war and things like that, because the Northern States wanted that the niggers should be free human beings, man, they are not human beings, they are animals, right, it’s completely wrong, man, the things that happened. People should be allowed to keep slaves, I think so anyway.\r\n(A)   Because blacks are not human beings?\r\n(G)   No, you can also see that from their body structure, man, big flat noses, with cauliflower ears etc., man. Broad heads and very broad bodies, man, hairy, you are looking at a gorilla and compare it with an ape, man, then it is the same [behaviour], man, it’s the same movements, long arms, man, long fingers etc., long feet.\r\n(A)   A lot of people are saying something different. There are a lot of people who say, but ...\r\n(G)   Just take a picture of a gorilla, man, and then look at a nigger, it’s the same body structure and everything, man, flat forehead and all kinds of things.\r\n(A)   There are many blacks, for example in the USA, who have important jobs.\r\n(G)   Of course, there is always someone who wants to show off, as if they are better than the white man, but in the long run, it’s the white man who is better.\r\n(A)   What does Ku Klux Klan mean to you?\r\n(G)   It means a great deal, because I think what they do is right. A nigger is not a human being, it’s an animal, that goes for all the other foreign workers as well, Turks, Yugoslavs and whatever they are called.\r\n(A)   Henrik is 19 years old and on welfare. He lives in a rented room in Studsgårdsgade. Henrik is one of the strongest supporters of the Klan, and he hates the foreign workers, ‘Perkere’ [a very derogatory word in Danish for immigrant workers].\r\n(G)   They come up here, man, and sponge on our society. But we, we have enough problems in getting our social benefits, man, they just get it. Fuck, we can argue with those idiots up there at the social benefit office to get our money, man, they just get it, man, they are the first on the housing list, they get better flats than us, man, and some of our friends who have children, man, they are living in the worst slum, man, they can’t even get a shower in their flat, man, then those ‘Perkere’-families, man, go up there with seven kids, man, and they just get an expensive flat, right there and then. They get everything paid, and things like that, that can’t be right, man, Denmark is for the Danes, right?\r\nIt is the fact that they are ‘Perkere’, that’s what we don’t like, right, and we don’t like their mentality - I mean they can damn well, I mean ... what’s it called ... I mean if they feel like speaking Russian in their homes, right, then it’s okay, but what we don’t like is when they walk around in those Zimbabwe-clothes and then speak this hula-hula language in the street, and if you ask them something or if you get into one of their taxis then they say: I don’t know where it is, you give directions right.\r\n(A)   Is it not so that perhaps you are a bit envious that some of the ‘Perkere’ as you call them have their own shops, and cars, they can make ends ...\r\n(G)   It’s drugs they are selling, man, half of the prison population in ‘Vestre’ are in there because of drugs, man, half of those in Vestre prison anyway, they are the people who are serving time for dealing drugs or something similar.\r\nThey are in there, all the ‘Perkere’, because of drugs, right. [That] must be enough, what’s it called, there should not be drugs here in this country, but if it really has to be smuggled in, I think we should do it ourselves, I mean, I think it’s unfair that those foreigners come up here to ... what’s it called ... make Denmark more drug dependent and things like that.\r\nWe have painted their doors and hoped that they would get fed up with it, so that they would soon leave, and jumped on their cars and thrown paint in their faces when they were lying in bed sleeping.\r\n(A)   What was it you did with that paint - why paint?\r\n(G)   Because it was white paint, I think that suited them well, that was the intended effect.\r\n(A)   You threw paint through the windows of an immigrant family?\r\n(G)   Yes.\r\n(A)   What happened?\r\n(G)   He just got it in his face, that’s all. Well, I think he woke up, and then he came out and shouted something in his hula-hula language.\r\n(A)   Did he report it to the police?\r\n(G)   I don’t know if he did, I mean, he won’t get anywhere by doing that.\r\n(A)   Why not?\r\n(G)   I don’t know, it’s just kid’s stuff, like other people throwing water in people’s faces, he got paint in his. They can’t make anything out of that.\r\n ---\r\n(A)   Per Axholt, known as ‘Pax’ [(P)], is employed in the youth centre in Studsgårdsgade. He has worked there for several years, but many give up a lot sooner because of the tough environment. Per Axholt feels that the reasons why the young people are persecuting the immigrants is that they are themselves powerless and disappointed.\r\nWhat do you think they would say that they want, if you asked them?\r\n(P)   Just what you and I want. Some control over their lives, work which may be considered decent and which they like, a reasonable economic situation, a reasonably functioning family, a wife or a husband and some children, a reasonable middle-class life such as you and I have.\r\n(A)   They do many things which are sure to prevent them from getting it.\r\n(P)   That is correct.\r\n(A)   Why do you think they do this?\r\n(P)   Because they have nothing better to do. They have been told over a long period that the means by which to achieve success is money. They won’t be able to get money legitimately, so often they try to obtain it through criminal activity. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes not, and that’s why we see a lot of young people in that situation go to prison, because it doesn’t work.\r\n ---\r\n(A)   How old were you when you started your criminal activities?\r\n(G)   I don’t know, about 14 I guess.\r\n(A)   What did you do?\r\n(G)   The first time, I can’t remember, I don’t know, burglary.\r\n(A)   Do you have what one might call a criminal career?\r\n(G)   I don’t know if you can call it that.\r\n(A)   You committed your first crime when you were 14.\r\n(G)   Well, you can put it that way, I mean, if that is a criminal career. If you have been involved in crime since the age of 15 onwards, then I guess you can say I’ve had a criminal career.\r\n(A)   Will you tell me about some of the things you have done?\r\n(G)   No, not really. It’s been the same over and over again. There has been pinching of videos, where the ‘Perkere’ have been our customers, so they have money. If people want to be out here and have a nice time and be racists and drink beer, and have fun, then it’s quite obvious you don’t want to sit in the slammer.\r\n(A)   But is the threat of imprisonment something that really deters people from doing something illegal?\r\n(G)   No, it’s not prison, that doesn’t frighten people.\r\n(A)   Is that why you hear stories about people from out here fighting with knives etc., night after night. Is the reason for this the fact that they are not afraid of the police getting hold of them?\r\n(G)   Yes, nothing really comes of it, I mean, there are no bad consequences, so probably that’s why. For instance fights and stabbings and smashing up things ... If you really get into the joint it would be such a ridiculously small sentence, so it would be, I mean ... usually we are released the next day. Last time we caused some trouble over at the pub, they let us out the next morning. Nothing really comes of it. It doesn’t discourage us, but there were five of us, who just came out and then we had a celebration for the last guy, who came out yesterday, they probably don’t want to go in again for some time so they probably won’t commit big crimes again.\r\n(A)   You would like to move back to Studsgårdsgade where you grew up, but we know for sure that it’s an environment with a high crime rate. Would you like your child to grow up like you?\r\n(G)   No, and I don’t think she will. Firstly, because she is a girl, statistics show that the risk is not that high, I mean they probably don’t do it, but you don’t have to be a criminal because you live in an environment with a high crime rate. I just wouldn’t accept it, if she was mugging old women and stealing their handbags.\r\n(A)   What if she was among those beating up the immigrants etc. What then?\r\n(G)   That would be okay. I wouldn’t have anything against that.\r\n ---\r\n(I)   We will have to see if the mentality of this family changes in the next generation. Finally, we would like to say that groups of young people like this one in STUDSEN at Østerbro, have been formed elsewhere in Copenhagen.\"\r\nB. Proceedings in the City Court of Copenhagen\r\n12.   Following the programme no complaints were made to the Radio Council, which had competence in such matters, or to Danmarks Radio but the Bishop of Ålborg complained to the Minister of Justice. After undertaking investigations the Public Prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings in the City Court of Copenhagen (Københavns Byret) against the three youths interviewed by the applicant, charging them with a violation of Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code (straffeloven) (see paragraph 19 below) for having made the statements cited below:\r\n\"... the Northern States wanted that the niggers should be free human beings, man, they are not human beings, they are animals.\"\r\n\"Just take a picture of a gorilla, man, and then look at a nigger, it’s the same body structure and everything, man, flat forehead and all kinds of things.\"\r\n\"A nigger is not a human being, it’s an animal, that goes for all the other foreign workers as well, Turks, Yugoslavs and whatever they are called.\"\r\n\"It is the fact that they are ‘Perkere’, that’s what we don’t like, right, and we don’t like their mentality ... what we don’t like is when they walk around in those Zimbabwe-clothes and then speak this hula-hula language in the street ...\"\r\n\"It’s drugs they are selling, man, half of the prison population in ‘Vestre’ are in there because of drugs ... they are the people who are serving time for dealing drugs ...\"\r\n\"They are in there, all the ‘Perkere’, because of drugs ...\"\r\nThe applicant was charged, under Article 266 (b) in conjunction with Article 23 (see paragraph 19 below), with aiding and abetting the three youths; the same charge was brought against the head of the news section of Danmarks Radio, Mr Lasse Jensen.\r\n13.   In the City Court counsel for the applicant and Mr Jensen called for their acquittal. He argued that the conduct of the applicant and Mr Jensen could in no way be compared to that of the other three defendants, with whose views they did not sympathise. They sought merely to provide a realistic picture of a social problem; in fact the programme only provoked resentment and aroused pity in respect of the three other defendants, who had exposed themselves to ridicule on their own terms. Accordingly, it was by no means the intention of Danmarks Radio to persuade others to subscribe to the same views as the Greenjackets, rather the contrary. Under the relevant law a distinction had to be drawn between the persons who made the statements and the programme editors, the latter enjoying a special freedom of expression. Having at that time a broadcasting monopoly, Danmarks Radio was under a duty to impart all opinions of public interest in a manner that reflected the speaker’s way of expressing himself. The public also had an interest in being informed of notoriously bad social attitudes, even those which were unpleasant. The programme was broadcast in the context of a public debate which had resulted in press comments, for instance in Information, and was simply an honest report on the realities of the youths in question. Counsel, referring inter alia to the above-mentioned article in Information, also pointed to the fact that no consistent prosecution policy had been followed in cases of this nature.\r\n14.   On 24 April 1987 the City Court convicted the three youths, one of them for having stated that \"niggers\" and \"foreign workers\" were \"animals\", and two of them for their assertions in relation to drugs and \"Perkere\". The applicant was convicted of aiding and abetting them, as was Mr Jensen, in his capacity as programme controller; they were sentenced to pay day-fines (dagsbøder) totalling 1,000 and 2,000 Danish kroner, respectively, or alternatively to five days’ imprisonment (hæfte).\r\nAs regards the applicant, the City Court found that, following the article in Information of 31 May 1985, he had visited the Greenjackets and after a conversation with Mr Axholt, amongst others, agreed that the three youths should participate in a television programme. The object of the programme had been to demonstrate the attitude of the Greenjackets to the racism at Østerbro, previously mentioned in the article in Information, and to show their social background. Accordingly, so the City Court held, the applicant had himself taken the initiative of making the television programme and, further, he had been well aware in advance that discriminatory statements of a racist nature were likely to be made during the interview. The interview had lasted several hours, during which beer, partly paid for by Danmarks Radio, was consumed. In this connection the applicant had encouraged the Greenjackets to express their racist views, which, in so far as they were broadcast on television, in itself constituted a breach of Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code. The statements were broadcast without any counterbalancing comments, after the recordings had been edited by the applicant. He was accordingly guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of Article 266 (b).\r\nC. Proceedings in the High Court of Eastern Denmark\r\n15.   The applicant and Mr Jensen, but not the three Greenjackets, appealed against the City Court’s judgment to the High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret). They essentially reiterated the submissions made before the City Court and, in addition, the applicant explained that, although he had suspected that the Greenjackets’ statements were punishable, he had refrained from omitting these from the programme, considering it crucial to show their actual attitude. He assumed that they were aware that they might incur criminal liability by making the statements and had therefore not warned them of this fact.\r\n16.   By judgment of 16 June 1988 the High Court, by five votes to one, dismissed the appeal.\r\nThe dissenting member was of the view that, although the statements by the Greenjackets constituted offences under Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code, the applicant and Mr Jensen had not transgressed the bounds of the freedom of speech to be enjoyed by television and other media, since the object of the programme was to inform about and animate public discussion on the particular racist attitudes and social background of the youth group in question.\r\nD. Proceedings in the Supreme Court\r\n17.   With leave the applicant and Mr Jensen appealed from the High Court judgment to the Supreme Court (Højesteret), which by four votes to one dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 13 February 1989. The majority held:\r\n\"The defendants have caused the publication of the racist statements made by a narrow circle of persons and thereby made those persons liable to punishment and have thus, as held by the City Court and the High Court, violated Article 266 (b) in conjunction with Article 23 of the Penal Code. [We] do not find that an acquittal of the defendants could be justified on the ground of freedom of expression in matters of public interest as opposed to the interest in the protection against racial discrimination. [We] therefore vote in favour of confirming the judgment [appealed from].\"\r\nJustice Pontoppidan stated in his dissent:\r\n\"The object of the programme was to contribute to information on an issue - the attitude towards foreigners - which was the subject of extensive and sometimes emotional public debate. The programme must be presumed to have given a clear picture of the Greenjackets’ views, of which the public was thus given an opportunity to be informed and form its own opinion. In view of the nature of these views, any counterbalancing during or immediately before or after would not have served a useful purpose. Although it concerned a relatively small group of people holding extreme views, the programme had a fair degree of news and information value. The fact that the defendants took the initiative to disseminate such views is not of paramount importance for the assessment of their conduct. In these circumstances and irrespective of the fact that the statements rightly have been found to be in violation of Article 266 (b), I question the advisability of finding the defendants guilty of aiding and abetting the violation of this provision. I therefore vote in favour of the defendants’ acquittal.\"\r\n18.   When the Supreme Court has rendered judgment in a case raising important issues of principle it is customary that a member of the majority publishes a detailed and authoritative statement of the reasons for the judgment. In keeping with this custom, Justice Hermann on 20 January 1990 published such a statement in the Weekly Law Journal (Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen, 1989, p. 399).\r\nAs regards the conviction of the applicant and Mr Jensen, the majority had attached importance to the fact that they had caused the racist statements to be made public. The applicant’s item had not been a direct report on a meeting. He had himself contacted the three youths and caused them to make assertions such as those previously made in Information, which he knew of and probably expected them to repeat. He had himself cut the recording of the interview, lasting several hours, down to a few minutes containing the crude comments. The statements, which would hardly have been punishable under Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code had they not been made to a wide circle (\"videre kreds\") of people, became clearly punishable as they were broadcast on television on the applicant’s initiative and with Mr Jensen’s approval. It was therefore beyond doubt that they had aided and abetted the dissemination of the statements.\r\nAcquitting the applicant and Mr Jensen could only be justified by reasons clearly outweighing the wrongfulness of their actions. In this connection, the interest in protecting those grossly insulted by the statements had to be weighed up against that of informing the public of the statements. Whilst it is desirable to allow the press the best possible conditions for reporting on society, press freedom cannot be unlimited since freedom of expression is coupled with responsibilities.\r\nIn striking a balance between the various interests involved, the majority had regard to the fact that the statements, which were brought to a wide circle of people, consisted of series of inarticulate, defamatory remarks and insults spoken by members of an insignificant group whose opinions could hardly be of interest to many people. Their news or information value was not such as to justify their dissemination and therefore did not warrant acquitting the defendants. This did not mean that extremist views could not be reported in the press, but such reports must be carried out in a more balanced and comprehensive manner than was the case in the television programme in question. Direct reports from meetings which were a matter of public interest should also be permitted.\r\nThe minority, on the other hand, considered that the right to information overrode the interests protected by Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code.\r\nFinally, Justice Hermann noted that the compatibility of the impugned measures with Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention was not raised during the trial.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\r\nA. The Penal Code\r\n19.   At the relevant time Article 266 (b) of the Penal Code provided:\r\n\"Any person who, publicly or with the intention of disseminating it to a wide circle (\"videre kreds\") of people, makes a statement, or other communication, threatening, insulting or degrading a group of persons on account of their race, colour, national or ethnic origin or belief shall be liable to a fine or to simple detention or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.\"\r\nArticle 23, paragraph 1, reads:\r\n\"A provision establishing a criminal offence shall apply to any person who has assisted the commission of the offence by instigation, advice or action. The punishment may be reduced if the person in question only intended to give assistance of minor importance or to strengthen an intent already resolved or if the offence has not been completed or an intended assistance failed.\"\r\nB. The 1991 Media Liability Act\r\n20.   The 1991 Media Liability Act (Medieansvarsloven, 1991:348), which entered into force on 1 January 1992, that is after the events giving rise to the present case, lays down rules inter alia on criminal liability in respect of television broadcasts. Section 18 provides:\r\n\"A person making a statement during a non-direct broadcast (forskudt udsendelse) shall be responsible for the statement under general statutory provisions, unless:\r\n(1) the identity of the person concerned does not appear from the broadcast; or\r\n(2) [that person] has not consented to the statement being broadcast; or\r\n(3) [he or she] has been promised that [he or she] may take part [in the broadcast] without [his or her] identity being disclosed and reasonable precautions have been taken to this effect.\r\nIn the situations described in paragraph 1, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) above, the editor is responsible for the contents of the statements even where a violation of the law has occurred without intent or negligence on his part ...\"\r\nPursuant to section 22:\r\n\"A person who reads out or in any other manner conveys a text or statement, is not responsible for the contents of that text or statement.\"\r\nIII.   INSTRUMENTS OF THE UNITED NATIONS\r\n21.   Provisions relating to the prohibition of racial discrimination and the prevention of propaganda of racist views and ideas are to be found in a number of international instruments, for example the 1945 United Nations Charter (paragraph 2 of the Preamble, Articles 1 para. 3, 13 para. 1 (b), 55 (c) and 76 (c)), the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Articles 1, 2 and 7) and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Articles 2 para. 1, 20 para. 2 and 26). The most directly relevant treaty is the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (\"the UN Convention\"), which has been ratified by a large majority of the Contracting States to the European Convention, including Denmark (9 December 1971). Articles 4 and 5 of that Convention provide:\r\nArticle 4\r\n\"States Parties condemn all propaganda and all organizations which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form, and undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination and, to this end, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in Article 5 of this Convention, inter alia:\r\n(a) shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof;\r\n...\"\r\nArticle 5\r\n\"In compliance with the fundamental obligation laid down in ... this Convention, States Parties undertake to prohibit and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of the following rights:\r\n...\r\n(d) ...\r\nviii. the right to freedom of opinion and expression;\r\n...\"\r\nThe effects of the \"due regard\" clause in Article 4 has given rise to differing interpretations and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (\"the UN Committee\" - set up to supervise the implementation of the UN Convention) was divided in its comments on the applicant’s conviction. The present case had been presented by the Danish Government in a report to the UN Committee. Whilst some members welcomed it as \"the clearest statement yet, in any country, that the right to protection against racial discrimination took precedence over the right to freedom of expression\", other members considered that \"in such cases the facts needed to be considered in relation to both rights\" (Report of the Committee to the General Assembly, Official Records, Forty-Fifth Session, Supplement No. 18 (A/45/18), p. 21, para. 56).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n22.   In his application (no. 15890/89) of 25 July 1989 to the Commission the applicant complained that his conviction violated his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.\r\n23.   On 8 September 1992 the Commission declared the application admissible. In its report of 8 July 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31), the Commission expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) (by twelve votes to four).\r\nThe full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment.\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE COURT\r\n24.   At the hearing on 20 April 1994 the Government invited the Court to hold that, as submitted in their memorial, there had been no violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 (art. 10)\r\n25.   The applicant maintained that his conviction and sentence for having aided and abetted the dissemination of racist remarks violated his right to freedom of expression within the meaning of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, which reads:\r\n\"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.\r\n2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\"\r\n26.   The Government contested this contention whereas the Commission upheld it.\r\n27.   It is common ground that the measures giving rise to the applicant’s case constituted an interference with his right to freedom of expression.\r\nIt is moreover undisputed that this interference was \"prescribed by law\", the applicant’s conviction being based on Articles 266 (b) and 23 (1) of the Penal Code. In this context, the Government pointed out that the former provision had been enacted in order to comply with the UN Convention. The Government’s argument, as the Court understands it, is that, whilst Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention is applicable, the Court, in applying paragraph 2 (art. 10-2), should consider that the relevant provisions of the Penal Code are to be interpreted and applied in an extensive manner, in accordance with the rationale of the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above). In other words, Article 10 (art. 10) should not be interpreted in such a way as to limit, derogate from or destroy the right to protection against racial discrimination under the UN Convention.\r\nFinally it is uncontested that the interference pursued a legitimate aim, namely the \"protection of the reputation or rights of others\".\r\nThe only point in dispute is whether the measures were \"necessary in a democratic society\".\r\n28.   The applicant and the Commission were of the view that, notwithstanding Denmark’s obligations as a Party to the UN Convention (see paragraph 21 above), a fair balance had to be struck between the \"protection of the reputation or rights of others\" and the applicant’s right to impart information. According to the applicant, such a balance was envisaged in a clause contained in Article 4 of the UN Convention to the effect that \"due regard\" should be had to \"the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights ... in Article 5 of [the UN] Convention\". The clause had been introduced at the drafting stage because of concern among a number of States that the requirement in Article 4 (a) that \"[States Parties] shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred\" was too sweeping and could give rise to difficulties with regard to other human rights, in particular the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In the applicant’s further submission, this explained why the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, when urging member States to ratify the UN Convention, had proposed that they add an interpretative statement to their instrument of ratification, which would, inter alia, stress that respect was also due for the rights laid down in the European Convention (Resolution (68) 30 adopted by the Ministers’ Deputies on 31 October 1968).\r\nThe applicant and the Commission emphasised that, taken in the context of the broadcast as a whole, the offending remarks had the effect of ridiculing their authors rather than promoting their racist views. The overall impression of the programme was that it sought to draw public attention to a matter of great public concern, namely racism and xenophobia. The applicant had deliberately included the offensive statements in the programme, not with the intention of disseminating racist opinions, but in order to counter them through exposure. The applicant pointed out that he tried to show, analyse and explain to his viewers a new phenomenon in Denmark at the time, that of violent racism practised by inarticulate and socially disadvantaged youths. Joined by the Commission, he considered that the broadcast could not have had any significant detrimental effects on the \"reputation or rights of others\". The interests in protecting the latter were therefore outweighed by those of protecting the applicant’s freedom of expression.\r\nIn addition the applicant alleged that had the 1991 Media Liability Act been in force at the relevant time he would not have faced prosecution since under the Act it is in principle only the author of a punishable statement who may be liable. This undermined the Government’s argument that his conviction was required by the UN Convention and \"necessary\" within the meaning of Article 10 (art. 10).\r\n29.   The Government contended that the applicant had edited the Greenjackets item in a sensationalist rather than informative manner and that its news or information value was minimal. Television was a powerful medium and a majority of Danes normally viewed the news programme in which the item was broadcast. Yet the applicant, knowing that they would incur criminal liability, had encouraged the Greenjackets to make racist statements and had failed to counter these statements in the programme. It was too subtle to assume that viewers would not take the remarks at their face value. No weight could be attached to the fact that the programme had given rise to only a few complaints, since, due to lack of information and insufficient knowledge of the Danish language and even fear of reprisals by violent racists, victims of the insulting comments were likely to be dissuaded from complaining. The applicant had thus failed to fulfil the \"duties and responsibilities\" incumbent on him as a television journalist. The fine imposed upon him was at the lower end of the scale of sanctions applicable to Article 266 (b) offences and was therefore not likely to deter any journalist from contributing to public discussion on racism and xenophobia; it only had the effect of a public reminder that racist expressions are to be taken seriously and cannot be tolerated.\r\nThe Government moreover disputed that the matter would have been dealt with differently had the 1991 Media Liability Act been in force at the material time. The rule that only the author of a punishable statement may incur liability was subject to exceptions (see paragraph 20 above); how the applicant’s case would have been considered under the 1991 Act was purely a matter of speculation.\r\nThe Government stressed that at all three levels the Danish courts, which were in principle better placed than the European Court to evaluate the effects of the programme, had carried out a careful balancing exercise of all the interests involved. The review effected by those courts had been similar to that carried out under Article 10 (art. 10); their decisions fell within the margin of appreciation to be left to the national authorities and corresponded to a pressing social need.\r\n30.   The Court would emphasise at the outset that it is particularly conscious of the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations. It may be true, as has been suggested by the applicant, that as a result of recent events the awareness of the dangers of racial discrimination is sharper today than it was a decade ago, at the material time. Nevertheless, the issue was already then of general importance, as is illustrated for instance by the fact that the UN Convention dates from 1965. Consequently, the object and purpose pursued by the UN Convention are of great weight in determining whether the applicant’s conviction, which - as the Government have stressed - was based on a provision enacted in order to ensure Denmark’s compliance with the UN Convention, was \"necessary\" within the meaning of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).\r\nIn the second place, Denmark’s obligations under Article 10 (art. 10) must be interpreted, to the extent possible, so as to be reconcilable with its obligations under the UN Convention. In this respect it is not for the Court to interpret the \"due regard\" clause in Article 4 of the UN Convention, which is open to various constructions. The Court is however of the opinion that its interpretation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention in the present case is compatible with Denmark’s obligations under the UN Convention.\r\n31.   A significant feature of the present case is that the applicant did not make the objectionable statements himself but assisted in their dissemination in his capacity of television journalist responsible for a news programme of Danmarks Radio (see paragraphs 9 to 11 above). In assessing whether his conviction and sentence were \"necessary\", the Court will therefore have regard to the principles established in its case-law relating to the role of the press (as summarised in for instance the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, pp. 29-30, para. 59).\r\nThe Court reiterates that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particular importance (ibid.). Whilst the press must not overstep the bounds set, inter alia, in the interest of \"the protection of the reputation or rights of others\", it is nevertheless incumbent on it to impart information and ideas of public interest. Not only does the press have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable to play its vital role of \"public watchdog\" (ibid.). Although formulated primarily with regard to the print media, these principles doubtless apply also to the audiovisual media.\r\nIn considering the \"duties and responsibilities\" of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor and it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Purcell and Others v. Ireland, Commission’s admissibility decision of 16 April 1991, application no. 15404/89, Decisions and Reports (DR) 70, p. 262). The audiovisual media have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart.\r\nAt the same time, the methods of objective and balanced reporting may vary considerably, depending among other things on the media in question. It is not for this Court, nor for the national courts for that matter, to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists. In this context the Court recalls that Article 10 (art. 10) protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed, but also the form in which they are conveyed (see the Oberschlick v. Austria judgment of 23 May 1991, Series A no. 204, p. 25, para. 57).\r\nThe Court will look at the interference complained of in the light of the case as a whole and determine whether the reasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are relevant and sufficient and whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued (see the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59). In doing so the Court has to satisfy itself that the national authorities did apply standards which were in conformity with the principles embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) and, moreover, that they based themselves on an acceptable assessment of the relevant facts (see, for instance, the Schwabe v. Austria judgment of 28 August 1992, Series A no. 242-B, pp. 32-33, para. 29).\r\nThe Court’s assessment will have regard to the manner in which the Greenjackets feature was prepared, its contents, the context in which it was broadcast and the purpose of the programme. Bearing in mind the obligations on States under the UN Convention and other international instruments to take effective measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and to prevent and combat racist doctrines and practices (see paragraph 21 above), an important factor in the Court’s evaluation will be whether the item in question, when considered as a whole, appeared from an objective point of view to have had as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas.\r\n32.   The national courts laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had himself taken the initiative of preparing the Greenjackets feature and that he not only knew in advance that racist statements were likely to be made during the interview but also had encouraged such statements. He had edited the programme in such a way as to include the offensive assertions. Without his involvement, the remarks would not have been disseminated to a wide circle of people and would thus not have been punishable (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above).\r\nThe Court is satisfied that these were relevant reasons for the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2).\r\n33.   On the other hand, as to the contents of the Greenjackets item, it should be noted that the TV presenter’s introduction started by a reference to recent public discussion and press comments on racism in Denmark, thus inviting the viewer to see the programme in that context. He went on to announce that the object of the programme was to address aspects of the problem, by identifying certain racist individuals and by portraying their mentality and social background. There is no reason to doubt that the ensuing interviews fulfilled that aim. Taken as a whole, the feature could not objectively have appeared to have as its purpose the propagation of racist views and ideas. On the contrary, it clearly sought - by means of an interview - to expose, analyse and explain this particular group of youths, limited and frustrated by their social situation, with criminal records and violent attitudes, thus dealing with specific aspects of a matter that already then was of great public concern.\r\nThe Supreme Court held that the news or information value of the feature was not such as to justify the dissemination of the offensive remarks (see paragraph 18 above). However, in view of the principles stated in paragraph 31 above, the Court sees no cause to question the Sunday News Magazine staff members’ own appreciation of the news or information value of the impugned item, which formed the basis for their decisions to produce and broadcast it.\r\n34.   Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the item was broadcast as part of a serious Danish news programme and was intended for a well-informed audience (see paragraph 9 above).\r\nThe Court is not convinced by the argument, also stressed by the national courts (see paragraphs 14 and 18 above), that the Greenjackets item was presented without any attempt to counterbalance the extremist views expressed. Both the TV presenter’s introduction and the applicant’s conduct during the interviews clearly dissociated him from the persons interviewed, for example by describing them as members of \"a group of extremist youths\" who supported the Ku Klux Klan and by referring to the criminal records of some of them. The applicant also rebutted some of the racist statements for instance by recalling that there were black people who had important jobs. It should finally not be forgotten that, taken as a whole, the filmed portrait surely conveyed the meaning that the racist statements were part of a generally anti-social attitude of the Greenjackets.\r\nAdmittedly, the item did not explicitly recall the immorality, dangers and unlawfulness of the promotion of racial hatred and of ideas of superiority of one race. However, in view of the above-mentioned counterbalancing elements and the natural limitations on spelling out such elements in a short item within a longer programme as well as the journalist’s discretion as to the form of expression used, the Court does not consider the absence of such precautionary reminders to be relevant.\r\n35.   News reporting based on interviews, whether edited or not, constitutes one of the most important means whereby the press is able to play its vital role of \"public watchdog\" (see, for instance, the above-mentioned Observer and Guardian judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 59). The punishment of a journalist for assisting in the dissemination of statements made by another person in an interview would seriously hamper the contribution of the press to discussion of matters of public interest and should not be envisaged unless there are particularly strong reasons for doing so. In this regard the Court does not accept the Government’s argument that the limited nature of the fine is relevant; what matters is that the journalist was convicted.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the remarks in respect of which the Greenjackets were convicted (see paragraph 14 above) were more than insulting to members of the targeted groups and did not enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10) (see, for instance, the Commission’s admissibility decisions in Glimmerveen and Hagenbeek v. the Netherlands, applications nos. 8348/78 and 8406/78, DR 18, p. 187; and Künen v. Germany, application no. 12194/86, DR 56, p. 205). However, even having regard to the manner in which the applicant prepared the Greenjackets item (see paragraph 32 above), it has not been shown that, considered as a whole, the feature was such as to justify also his conviction of, and punishment for, a criminal offence under the Penal Code.\r\n36.   It is moreover undisputed that the purpose of the applicant in compiling the broadcast in question was not racist. Although he relied on this in the domestic proceedings, it does not appear from the reasoning in the relevant judgments that they took such a factor into account (see paragraphs 14, 17 and 18 above).\r\n37.   Having regard to the foregoing, the reasons adduced in support of the applicant’s conviction and sentence were not sufficient to establish convincingly that the interference thereby occasioned with the enjoyment of his right to freedom of expression was \"necessary in a democratic society\"; in particular the means employed were disproportionate to the aim of protecting \"the reputation or rights of others\". Accordingly the measures gave rise to a breach of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.\r\nII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50)\r\n38.   Mr Jersild sought just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention, according to which:\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\r\n39.   The Government accepted parts of his claim. The Commission offered no comments.\r\nA. Pecuniary damage\r\n40.   The applicant claimed 1,000 kroner in respect of the fine imposed upon him, to be reimbursed by him to Danmarks Radio which had provisionally paid the fine for him.\r\n41.   The Government did not object and the Court finds that the amount should be awarded.\r\nB. Non-pecuniary damage\r\n42.   The applicant requested 20,000 kroner in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. He maintained that his professional reputation had been prejudiced and that he had felt distress as a result of his conviction.\r\n43.   The Court observes that the applicant still works with the Sunday News Magazine at Danmarks Radio and that his employer has supported him throughout the proceedings, inter alia by paying the fine (see paragraphs 9 and 40 above) and legal fees (see paragraph 44 below). It agrees with the Government that the finding of a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) constitutes in itself adequate just satisfaction in this respect.\r\nC. Costs and expenses\r\n44.   The applicant claimed in respect of costs and expenses:\r\n(a) 45,000 kroner for work done in the domestic proceedings by his lawyer, Mr J. Stockholm;\r\n(b) by way of legal fees incurred in the Strasbourg proceedings, 13,126.80 kroner for Mrs Johannessen, 6,900 pounds sterling for Mr Boyle and 50,000 kroner (exclusive 25% value-added tax) for Mr Trier;\r\n(c) 20,169.20 kroner to cover costs of translation, interpretation and an expert opinion;\r\n(d) 25,080 kroner, 965.40 pounds and 4,075 French francs in travel and subsistence expenses incurred in connection with the hearings before the Commission and Court, as well as miscellaneous expenses.\r\nParts of the above costs and expenses had been provisionally disbursed by Danmarks Radio.\r\n45.   The Government did not object to the above claims. The Court considers that the applicant is entitled to recover the sums in their entirety. They should be increased by any value-added taxes that may be chargeable.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\r\n1.   Holds by twelve votes to seven that there has been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention;\r\n\r\n2.   Holds by seventeen votes to two that Denmark is to pay the applicant, within three months, 1,000 (one thousand) Danish kroner in compensation for pecuniary damage; and, for costs and expenses, the sums resulting from the calculations to be made in accordance with paragraph 45 of the judgment;\r\n\r\n3.   Dismisses unanimously the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\r\n\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 September 1994.\r\nRolv RYSSDAL\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nActing Registrar\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\r\n(a) joint dissenting opinion of Mr Ryssdal, Mr Bernhardt, Mr Spielmann and Mr Loizou;\r\n(b) joint dissenting opinion of Mr Gölcüklü, Mr Russo and Mr Valticos;\r\n(c) supplementary joint dissenting opinion of Mr Gölcüklü and Mr Valticos.\r\n\r\nR. R.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES RYSSDAL, BERNHARDT, SPIELMANN AND LOIZOU\r\n1.   This is the first time that the Court has been concerned with a case of dissemination of racist remarks which deny to a large group of persons the quality of \"human beings\". In earlier decisions the Court has - in our view, rightly - underlined the great importance of the freedom of the press and the media in general for a democratic society, but it has never had to consider a situation in which \"the reputation or rights of others\" (Article 10 para. 2) (art. 10-2) were endangered to such an extent as here.\r\n2.   We agree with the majority (paragraph 35 of the judgment) that the Greenjackets themselves \"did not enjoy the protection of Article 10 (art. 10)\". The same must be true of journalists who disseminate such remarks with supporting comments or with their approval. This can clearly not be said of the applicant. Therefore it is admittedly difficult to strike the right balance between the freedom of the press and the protection of others. But the majority attributes much more weight to the freedom of the journalist than to the protection of those who have to suffer from racist hatred.\r\n3.   Neither the written text of the interview (paragraph 11 of the judgment) nor the video film we have seen makes it clear that the remarks of the Greenjackets are intolerable in a society based on respect for human rights. The applicant has cut the entire interview down to a few minutes, probably with the consequence or even the intention of retaining the most crude remarks. That being so, it was absolutely necessary to add at least a clear statement of disapproval. The majority of the Court sees such disapproval in the context of the interview, but this is an interpretation of cryptic remarks. Nobody can exclude that certain parts of the public found in the television spot support for their racist prejudices.\r\nAnd what must be the feelings of those whose human dignity has been attacked, or even denied, by the Greenjackets? Can they get the impression that seen in context the television broadcast contributes to their protection? A journalist’s good intentions are not enough in such a situation, especially in a case in which he has himself provoked the racist statements.\r\n4.   The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination probably does not require the punishment of journalists responsible for a television spot of this kind. On the other hand, it supports the opinion that the media too can be obliged to take a clear stand in the area of racial discrimination and hatred.\r\n5.   The threat of racial discrimination and persecution is certainly serious in our society, and the Court has rightly emphasised the vital importance of combating racial discrimination in all its forms and manifestations (paragraph 30 of the judgment). The Danish courts fully recognised that protection of persons whose human dignity is attacked has to be balanced against the right to freedom of expression. They carefully considered the responsibility of the applicant, and the reasons for their conclusions were relevant. The protection of racial minorities cannot have less weight than the right to impart information, and in the concrete circumstances of the present case it is in our opinion not for this Court to substitute its own balancing of the conflicting interests for that of the Danish Supreme Court. We are convinced that the Danish courts acted inside the margin of appreciation which must be left to the Contracting States in this sensitive area. Accordingly, the findings of the Danish courts cannot be considered as giving rise to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.\r\n \r\n \r\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES GÖLCÜKLÜ, RUSSO AND VALTICOS\r\n(Translation)\r\nWe cannot share the opinion of the majority of the Court in the Jersild case.\r\nThere are indeed two major principles at issue in this case, one being that of freedom of expression, embodied in Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention, the other the prohibition on defending racial hatred, which is obviously one of the restrictions authorised by paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and, moreover, is the subject of basic human rights documents adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, in particular the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. That Convention manifestly cannot be ignored when the European Convention is being implemented. It is, moreover, binding on Denmark. It must also guide the European Court of Human Rights in its decisions, in particular as regards the scope it confers on the terms of the European Convention and on the exceptions which the Convention lays down in general terms.\r\nIn the Jersild case the statements made and willingly reproduced in the relevant broadcast on Danish television, without any significant reaction on the part of the commentator, did indeed amount to incitement to contempt not only of foreigners in general but more particularly of black people, described as belonging to an inferior, subhuman race (\"the niggers ... are not human beings ... Just take a picture of a gorilla ... and then look at a nigger, it’s the same body structure ... A nigger is not a human being, it’s an animal, that goes for all the other foreign workers as well, Turks, Yugoslavs and whatever they are called.\").\r\nWhile appreciating that some judges attach particular importance to freedom of expression, the more so as their countries have largely been deprived of it in quite recent times, we cannot accept that this freedom should extend to encouraging racial hatred, contempt for races other than the one to which we belong, and defending violence against those who belong to the races in question. It has been sought to defend the broadcast on the ground that it would provoke a healthy reaction of rejection among the viewers. That is to display an optimism, which to say the least, is belied by experience. Large numbers of young people today, and even of the population at large, finding themselves overwhelmed by the difficulties of life, unemployment and poverty, are only too willing to seek scapegoats who are held up to them without any real word of caution; for - and this is an important point - the journalist responsible for the broadcast in question made no real attempt to challenge the points of view he was presenting, which was necessary if their impact was to be counterbalanced, at least for the viewers.\r\nThat being so, we consider that by taking criminal measures - which were, moreover, moderate ones - the Danish judicial institutions in no way infringed Article 10 (art. 10) of the Convention.\r\n \r\n \r\nSUPPLEMENTARY JOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES GÖLCÜKLÜ AND VALTICOS\r\n(Translation)\r\nWe have voted against point 2 of the operative provisions of the judgment because we are so firmly convinced that the applicant was wrong not to react against the defence of racism that we consider it wholly unjustified to award him any compensation whatever.\r\n\r\n",

O'BOYLE, Section Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 6 July 2004,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.  The case originated in an application (no. 26144/95) against the Republic of Turkey lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by two Turkish nationals of Kurdish origin, Mr Abdurrazak İkincisoy  and Mr Halil İkincisoy (“the applicants”), on 19 May 1994.\r\n2.  The applicants were represented by Mr Boyle and Ms Hampson, lawyers in the United Kingdom. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) did not designate an agent for the purposes of the proceedings before the Court.\r\n3.  The applicants alleged that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy, the son of the first applicant and the brother of the second applicant, was killed in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the respondent Government. In this respect, they invoked Articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13 and 14 of the Convention as well as former Article 25 of the Convention\r\n4.  The application was declared partly admissible by the Commission on 26 February 1996. Delegates of the Commission then took oral evidence at a hearing in Ankara between 28 June and 2 July 1999.\r\n5.  The case was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1999 in accordance with Article 5 § 3, second sentence, of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, the Commission not having completed its examination of the case by that date.\r\n6.  The application was allocated to the First Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1. Mr R. Türmen, the judge elected in respect of Turkey, withdrew from sitting in the case (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr F. Gölcüklü to sit as an ad hoc judge (Article 27 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 § 1).\r\n7.  The applicants and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1) The Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other's observations.\r\n8.  On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1). This case was assigned to the newly composed Fourth Section (Rule 52 § 1).\r\nTHE FACTS\r\nI.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n9.  The applicants were born in 1933 and 1974 respectively and live in Diyarbakır.\r\nA.  The facts\r\n10.  The facts surrounding the arrest and subsequent death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy (“Mehmet Şah”) are in dispute between the parties.\r\n1.  Facts as presented by the applicants\r\n11.  On 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. plain-clothes police officers arrived at the first applicant, Abdurrazak İkincisoy's (“Abdurrazak”) , apartment in Diyarbakır. They entered the apartment, carried out a quick search and inquired about Mehmet Şah. Abdurrazak informed them that Mehmet Şah was spending the night in his uncle Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment. Leaving one of the officers with Abdurrazak1, Garipşah İkincisoy, Hüseyin İkincisoy, Makbule İkincisoy and Nefise İkincisoy, the rest of the officers left taking the second applicant, Halil İkincisoy (“Halil”), with them to show them the way.\r\n12.  When they arrived at Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment, one of the police officers remained at the entrance of the building. Halil and two officers went up to the second floor. When they entered the apartment, the police officers carried out a search and an identity check. Several members of the İkincisoy family were present in the apartment, namely Mehmet Şah, Abdülkadir, Nasır, Adile, Sabriye, and Bilgi İkincisoy, as well as fourteen grandchildren of Abdülkadir İkincisoy and two of Mehmet Şah's friends. One of the police officers interrogated these two men in one of the rooms. The rest of the group was held in the sitting room. Suddenly, a gun shot was heard from the room and an armed clash broke between the police officers and the two men. The police officer who was interrogating the two men was shot dead. When the shooting started, the second police officer grabbed Mehmet Şah by his arm and dragged him downstairs. Halil and the others saw the two men try to escape. They heard further gunshots from downstairs. The group subsequently learnt that one of the men had died, the other had escaped and the officer who was waiting outside the building had been wounded.\r\n13.  Approximately ten minutes following the incident, several police teams surrounded the building. Halil, Abdülkadir, Adile, Nasır, Sabriye and Bilgi İkincisoy were arrested and taken to the Çarşı Police Station by a minibus. When they arrived at the Çarşı Police Station, they were detained in the entrance hall. On the right hand side of the entrance hall, there were three rooms, two of which were used for interrogation and the third was the office of the superintendent. Halil was called in to one of the small rooms for interrogation. When he entered the room, he saw his brother Mehmet Şah, lying on the floor face down, with his red leather jacket pulled over his head. In the meantime Abdurrazak , Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy were also arrested and brought to the Çarşı Station by another minibus. When the second group entered the station, they were told to cover their heads with their jackets. Abdurrazak1 however was able to see through the parting of his jacket. He also saw his son Mehmet Şah standing behind him. The group was subsequently transferred to another location by a minibus. Abdurrazak1 saw Mehmet Şah also in this second location. They were then brought to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters for interrogation, where the applicants heard the cries of Mehmet Şah.\r\n14.  The first applicant was held in custody until 25 November 1995. When he was released, the police officers told him that if anyone asked about his son Mehmet Şah, the applicant had to say that he had fled to the mountains to join the guerrillas. The second applicant was released on 3 December 1993, eleven days after his arrest.\r\n15.  On 6 December 1993 the first applicant went to the Diyarbakır State Security Court Public Prosecutor and submitted a petition outlining his concerns for the fate of his son. The public prosecutor showed him some photographs and from these photos the first applicant identified the body of Mehmet Şah. The public prosecutor informed him that Mehmet Şah had died in an armed clash on 25 November 1993 and that his body had been buried. When Abdurrazak  went to the cemetery, two unmarked graves were shown to him and he was told that one of them belonged to Mehmet Şah. On 13 December 1993 Abdurrazak1 submitted a petition to the Diyarbakır State Security Court Chief Public Prosecutor's office and requested permission to open his son's grave. His request was rejected verbally. On 13 December 1993 Abdurrazak1 lodged two petitions with the Diyarbakır State Security Court Chief Public Prosecutor's Office. He requested that an autopsy be conducted on Mehmet Şah's body in order to learn the true circumstances surrounding his death. He was told to go to the court to get permission for an autopsy. He filed another petition with the State Minister responsible for human rights and requested an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death of his son. On 21 March 1993 the Ministry replied that Mehmet Şah had never been taken into custody.\r\n16.  Following the communication of the application to the Government, Abdurrazak1 was summoned to the Diyarbakır public prosecutor's office on 6 June 1995. He was questioned about his application to the Commission and was forced to sign a statement in which he expressed his wish to retract his application. Thereafter he went to the Diyarbakır Human Rights Association and informed them about this incident.\r\n2.  Facts as presented by the Government\r\n17.  The Government stated that while the Anti-Terrorism Department of the Diyarbakır Security Court was taking a statement from an arrested person in connection with an ongoing investigation, they were informed that a person called Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was aiding and abetting the PKK. Accordingly a team of police officers went to Abdurrazak's1 apartment searching for his son Mehmet Şah. When they arrived at the apartment, the officers were informed that Mehmet Şah was spending the night at his uncle's apartment. Taking Halil with them to show them the way, the officers subsequently went to Abdulkadir İkincisoy's apartment. The officers carried out a search and found four men sleeping in one of the rooms. As they interrogated them, one of the men opened fire and killed one of the police officers. Another officer was wounded during the incident. The Government further stated that the four men tried to escape however one of them was shot dead.\r\n18.  The Government further submitted that on 23 November 1993 the security forces received an anonymous telephone call, informing them that two armed men had been seen hiding in a hut near the Ongözlü Bridge. Accordingly, an operation was conducted. When the officers arrived near the hut, an armed clash broke out and lasted approximately twenty minutes. Following the clash, two men were found dead in the hut. The officers took photographs of the bodies to enable their identification. On 24 November 1993 an autopsy was conducted on one of the bodies, which was later identified as Mehmet Şah from the photographs. Furthermore, according to the ballistic examination reports, the guns that were found in the hut matched those used on 22 November 1993 in Abdulkadir İkincisoy's apartment.\r\nB.  Documents submitted by the parties\r\n19.  The parties submitted various documents to the Court. While delivering its judgment, the Court had particular regard to the following documents:\r\n1.  Incident report dated 22 November 1993 concerning the events at Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment\r\n20.  The report stated that in connection with an ongoing investigation, a search was conducted in a house on 22 November 1993. The officers were looking for Hanefi İkincisoy  however they were informed that Hanefi İkincisoy was at his uncle's house. Accordingly, taking Halil with them to show them the way, the police officers left the apartment. When they arrived at the second apartment, the officers conducted a quick search and found four or five men sleeping in one of the rooms. When the officers asked the men to show their identification paper, they were attacked and a gun was fired. One person was arrested and while he was being taken to the police vehicle downstairs, another police officer was shot and wounded. The arrested person escaped and the person who had shot the officer was killed.\r\n2.  Report dated 23 November 1993 concerning the anonymous telephone call received by the police\r\n21.  According to the report, which was signed by officer Mustafa Şen, on 23 November 1993 at about 3 a.m. the anti-terrorism department received an anonymous telephone call informing them that the perpetrators of the incident of the previous day, who had caused the death of a police officer and the wounding of another, had been seen in a hut near the Ongözlü Brigde.\r\n3.  Incident report dated 23 November 1993 concerning the clash\r\n22.  The report states that following information from an anonymous telephone call at about 3 a.m. that two armed men were hiding in a hut near the Öngözlü Bridge, a police operation was carried out. Taking the necessary safety precautions, the officers positioned themselves 15 metres away from the hut and ordered the two men to surrender. Shots were fired from the hut in the direction of the security forces and a clash broke out. The clash lasted approximately twenty minutes. When the firing ceased, police officers entered the hut and found two dead bodies. One of the bodies had an ammunition belt with four cartridge clip holders, a Kalashnikov rifle and a cartridge clip. A Browning pistol was found on the second body. There were no identity cards on the bodies, which were subsequently taken to the State Hospital morgue.\r\n4.

Two bullet entrance holes on the back side of the neck and two exit holes in the chest were noted. The report further stated that no other signs were observed.

Finally, the estimated time of death was given as thirty-six hours before the autopsy was carried out.\r\n5.  Photographs of the three dead bodies\r\n24.  The Government have provided the photographs of the three dead bodies and photographs taken in the hut where Mehmet Şah was shot.\r\n6.  Custody records\r\n25.

The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, three Delegates of the Commission took oral evidence in Ankara between 28 June and 2 July 1999 from ten witnesses, including the applicants. The evidence of those who attended the hearing may be summarised as follows:\r\n1.  Abdurrazak İkincisoy \r\n43.  The witness, who is the first applicant, stated that on the day of the incident at about 1 a.m. police officers had come to his house, looking for his son Mehmet Şah. He informed the officers that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house and told his other son Halil to show them the way. About half an hour after they had left, police officers came back and arrested everyone in the apartment, namely Hüseyin, Nefise, Makbule and Garipşah İkincisoy. They were first taken to the Çarşı Police Station. The police officers forced them to cover their heads with their jackets but the witness was able to see through the parting of his jacket. He saw that his two sons Halil and Mehmet Şah were also in the station. Thereafter, they were taken to the police headquarters by minibus. The witness further recalled seeing Mehmet Şah in the minibus. They waited for about half an hour at the police headquarters before being taken to the Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters, where they were blindfolded and the witness was able to hear the cries of Mehmet Şah. The witness and his daughters were released from custody three days after their arrest. At the time of his release, the officers told him that his son had fled to the mountains. They gave him Mehmet Şah's leather jacket but the witness refused to take it stating that his son would be cold without his jacket. The younger son of the witness, Halil, was released fourteen days after his arrest. When Mehmet Şah did not return home, the witness went to the Diyarbakır public prosecutor and asked about his son's whereabouts. The public prosecutor showed him some photos and asked him whether any of were of his son Mehmet Şah. The applicant identified his son's body. The prosecutor informed him that his son had died during an armed clash between the PKK and the security forces.\r\n44.  The witness further explained that after he filed his application with the European Commission of Human Rights, he was summoned to the public prosecutor's office in 1995. The public prosecutor was angry with him for filing an application with the Commission. Out of fear, the witness stated before the public prosecutor that he would retract his application. However, before the Delegates, the witness affirmed that he intended to pursue his application. Finally he stated that he was able to visit his son's grave and pray for him.\r\n2.  Halil İkincisoy\r\n45.  The witness, who is the second applicant, stated that on 22 November 1993 police officers had come to their house at about 1 a.m. He saw Feyzi Tatlı, a distant relative, with the police officers. The police officers carried out a quick search in the house and asked for his brother Mehmet Şah. His father, Abdurrazak , told them that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, the witness accepted to accompany the three police officers to his uncle's house. When they arrived, the witness knocked on the door. Sabriye İkincisoy answered the door and let them in. One of the police officers remained outside and two of them entered. The officers conducted a search and carried out an identity check. When they found Mehmet Şah, they arrested him. Taking Mehmet Şah by his arm, one of the officers went out. The witness followed them. As they were walking along the corridor, they heard gunshots. The police officer, who was holding Mehmet Şah by his arm, dragged him downstairs. At that time, the witness saw Mehmet Şah's two friends running downstairs but he did not see where they went. The witness then fled to the neighbour's flat. His uncle Abdülkadir, his cousin Nasır, Nasır's wife and Abdülkadir's wife also joined him. Some time later, they were all arrested by the police and taken to the Çarşı Police Station. The police officers told them to cover their heads with their jackets. When they arrived at the Çarşı Station, they were forced to wait in a corridor. He described the entrance of the station and stated that there was a small hall followed by a long corridor, at the end of which there was a room. The witness saw Mehmet Şah lying face down on the floor in that room. Mehmet Şah was wearing a shirt, a pull over, a brownish leather jacket and denim jeans.\r\n46.  The witness further confirmed seeing his father and sisters in the Çarşı Station. Subsequently, they were taken to a second place in a car, where they waited for a few minutes. The witness stated that he did not see Mehmet Şah in the second place. Then they were taken to a third place. The witness did not see anyone in this third place but heard the voices of his uncle, Feyzi Tatlı, and Mehmet Şah. Mehmet Şah was screaming in pain. The witness was kept there for thirteen days and he was allegedly ill-treated. The officers told him that his brother had escaped to the mountains. He was forced to sign a statement without reading its content. When he was released from custody, the witness went to the public prosecutor with his father to discover the fate of Mehmet Şah. The witness stated that when Mehmet Şah's body was identified from the photographs, they were told that he had been buried. An officer showed them two graves and informed them that he did not know which one was Mehmet Şah's.\r\n3.  Nasır İkincisoy\r\n47.  The witness, who is the first applicant's nephew, stated that on the night of 22 November 1993, he was at his father's house. His father (Abdülkadir İkincisoy), his mother (Adile), his wife (Sabriye), his children, his brother (Muhlis), and his brother's children were also at home. He recalled that his uncle's son, Mehmet Şah and his two friends had spent the night with them. The witness maintained that at about 1 a.m. two plain-clothes police officers had come to their house, together with his cousin Halil, searching for Mehmet Şah. At that time Mehmet Şah was sleeping in the guest room, together with his two friends and the brother of the witness, Muhlis. The police officers carried out an identity check and then told Mehmet Şah and his two friends that they had to come to the police station for interrogation. One of the officers held Mehmet Şah by the arm. At that moment they heard a gun shot. The police officer who was holding Mehmet Şah also started shooting. Mehmet Şah tried to prevent the police officer from shooting but the same police officer dragged him down the stairs. The witness further recalled that the family members fled to their neighbour's to protect themselves. After some time, more police officers arrived and arrested everyone. While they were being taken to the police station, the witness saw that one of the persons who had come with Mehmet Şah had been shot dead. The witness was put in a car and taken to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters. He remembered standing in a long corridor. Despite the fact that he was blindfolded, the witness was able to see around. He saw that his mother, his wife, the daughter of Muhlis and his uncle were also there. He also saw Feyzi Tatlı, a distant cousin. The witness said that he was taken to a room which was wet, where he saw Mehmet Şah, who was being tortured. Mehmet Şah was lying on the floor. He said to the witness “Our family is ruined. They will kill us all. What is this we are going through?”. The witness stated that this was the last time he saw Mehmet Şah.\r\n4.  Garipşah İkincisoy\r\n48.  The witness, who is the daughter of the first applicant and the sister of the second, was at her father's house on the night of the incident. She said that while they were sleeping at home, some police officers came to their house and asked about her brother Mehmet Şah. When her father explained to the police officers that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house, the police officers left the house, taking Halil with them. Some time after, the police officers came back and arrested everyone in the house, including the witness. They were first taken to Çarşı Police Station and then to the police headquarters. The witness explained that she had not seen Mehmet Şah in the Çarşı Station but she had seen him at the police headquarters. When they arrived at the police headquarters, they walked upstairs and were taken into a hall. Their eyes were not covered but they were forced to hold their hands behind the back of their necks. They were made to stand facing the wall. When the witness glanced over her shoulder, she saw that Mehmet Şah was standing next to her. This was the last time she saw him. However she recalled hearing his voice at the Rapid Intervention Force, which was the third place they were taken to. He was moaning. She was kept in a cell, together with Makbule, Nefise, Adile, Bilge and Sabriye İkincisoy. At some point, Sabriye and Makbule were taken out of the cell and when they came back they were shivering. They therefore requested a blanket from the guardians and the guardians gave them a brown leather jacket which belonged to Mehmet Şah.\r\n5.  Şerif Akay\r\n49.  The witness affirmed that he was a police officer at the Anti-Terrorism Branch of Diyarbakır Security Directorate at the time of the events. He recalled that after receiving information from Feyzi Tatlı, a person who was under custody, that Mehmet Şah had been aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was prepared. Feyzi Tatlı was asked to point out the house of Mehmet Şah to a group of five police officers, including the witness. On 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. they arrived at the apartment of Abdurrazak , the father of Mehmet Şah. Abdurrazak1 told them that his son was staying at his uncle's house. Accordingly, taking a young person with them to show them the way, and leaving one police officer in the house of Abdurrazak1, they left. When they arrived at Mehmet Şah's uncle's house, one police officer remained near the patrol car, and the witness stayed outside the building. Two police officers went upstairs. A few minutes later the witness heard gun shots from upstairs. One of the police officers, Mustafa Hünerlitürkoğlu, came downstairs, holding someone by the wrist. He told the witness that the third police officer, Alişan, had been shot. The witness entered the building to help his colleague. At that time Mustafa went outside, still holding the detainee by the wrist. The witness then heard footsteps and he hid under the stairs. A person fired a Kalashnikov rifle at the witness and wounded him in the abdomen. The witness fired back and killed the person who had fired at him. He then went out of the building to get help. When officer Mustafa saw that the witness was wounded, he left the detainee and ran towards him. The person who had been in custody ran away. The witness was subsequently taken to hospital, where he underwent an operation. When he regained consciousness in the hospital, his colleagues asked him to sign the incident report they had prepared. The public prosecutor further took his statement while he was still in intensive care. The witness accepted that there had been a mistake in the names that appeared in the incident report. He agreed that instead of Hanefi İkincisoy, the name should have read Mehmet Şah İkincisoy. The witness further explained that he had not been involved in the arrests or interrogations of the people who had been in the house at the time of the incident.\r\n6.  Mustafa Hünerlitürkoğlu\r\n50.  The witness confirmed that he was one of the five police officers who had gone to Mehmet Şah's apartment on 22 November 1993 at about 1 a.m. He recalled that after Feyzi Tatlı, a detainee, confessed during a police interrogation that Mehmet Şah was aiding and abetting the PKK, an operation was conducted to apprehend this person. Feyzi Tatlı showed them where Mehmet Şah lived. When they set off to arrest Mehmet Şah, the officers did not know what he looked like. One of the police officers stayed in the car, and the other four went into the house. Feyzi Tatlı was sent back to the police station in another vehicle. An elderly person opened the door, and informed them that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house that night. A young person accompanied the officers to the house in question. One of the police officers stayed behind in the house to ensure that no one could call Mehmet Şah to warn him. Accordingly, the three police officers and the young person went to the house of Mehmet Şah's uncle. A middle aged lady opened the door. The witness stated that they told the lady they would carry out an identity check and they entered the apartment. The witness went inside the room that was on the opposite side of the entrance. In that room, there were women and children. In the meantime, his colleague Alişan went inside another room from which an old man and a younger man had come out. The officers found a third room, in which four persons were sleeping. The witness made them stand in the corridor, while Alişan stayed in the room and called them in one by one for an identity check. A few minutes later, the witness heard noises coming from the third room and when he went in, he saw that a man was struggling with officer Alişan. The witness tried to help however the other persons interfered. One of the men had a Kalashnikov rifle and he fired at Alişan. When the witness saw that Alişan was shot, he grabbed one of the men, who did not have a gun, to use him as a shield. The witness ran downstairs to get help, still holding that man by his wrist. Downstairs, he met the third officer, Şerif, and told him that an armed clash had broken out upstairs and that Alişan had been shot. The witness then went outside the building to go to the car to use the radio. At that time, he heard Şerif ordering someone to surrender and subsequently he heard gun shots. The witness ran back to the building, letting go off the person he was holding. When he entered the building he saw that Şerif had been shot and the person who had shot at him had been killed. They called for reinforcements. 15 to 20 minutes after the incident, they were able to send Şerif to the hospital and thereafter he drafted the incident report by hand. The witness further explained that he had given the incident report to his colleagues who had arrived at the scene of incident and they had typed it up. He remembered signing the typed incident report at the hospital. When asked about the names indicated in the incident report, the witness admitted that there was a mistake. He had written Mehmet Şah's name as Hanefi İkincisoy. The witness further maintained that he had given a statement to the public prosecutor in the hospital. The witness also stated that he had not seen the photos of the two terrorists who were killed in a clash, the day after the incident.\r\n7.  Dr. Lokman Eğilmez\r\n51.  The witness confirmed that he had signed the autopsy report of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy. He is a doctor specialised in forensic medicine and pathology. He has been a forensic doctor since 1991. The witness did not recall the autopsy of Mehmet Şah however by looking at the documents he explained that the estimated time of death was 36 hours before the autopsy was carried out. There were no bruises on the body. There were certain discoloured spots but these were not signs of beating or force. The cause of death was the two bullets that had entered from the upper back region. There was an exit hole around the left breast, and another exit hole on the upper right side of the chest. Dr Eğilmez concluded that the entry and exit holes made it clear that the person had not been shot at close range.\r\n8.  Ramazan Sürücü\r\n52.  The witness affirmed that he was the head of Diyarbakır Anti-Terrorism Department at the time of the incident. He recalled that on the basis of information received from a detainee, Feyzi Tatlı, an operation was carried out to apprehend certain people. The witness was the head of the Central Branch however the interrogation office was located in the Rapid Intervention Force Building, which was also known as the police school. Officer Sürücü stated that as a general rule, the detainees were taken directly to the police school for interrogation. When asked about the armed clash, during which Mehmet Şah had allegedly been killed, the witness stated that he had not been directly involved in the operation. Although his name appeared on the incident report, he explained that these reports were usually signed by the officers who were replacing him and who had the power to sign for him. He remembered however that, on the day of the clash, they had received an anonymous call indicating that the two terrorists, who had escaped the day before, were hiding in a hut.\r\n53.  The witness further confirmed that he had never been interrogated concerning the allegation that Mehmet Şah had died under torture.\r\n9.  Mustafa Taner Şentürk\r\n54.  The witness, who is a police officer, stated that he was serving at the interrogation office of the Anti-Terrorism Department of Diyarbakır police headquarters in November 1993. He was police superintendent. The witness explained that, at that time, there were three interrogation teams and he was in charge of the first team. When asked about the general procedure that was followed after a person was arrested, he explained that before being brought for interrogation, all arrested persons were first sent for a medical examination. He emphasized the fact that the detainees were not blindfolded during the interrogation and that no one had been ill-treated. The interrogation office command was located in the headquarters of the Rapid Intervention Force in Diyarbakır. All the interrogations were conducted there. He refused the suggestion that the detainees could first be taken to the Çarşı Police Station. When a detainee was interrogated, the officers first asked about his past, and then certain questions were put to him. There was no standard form of procedure for interrogation.\r\n55.  The witness affirmed that he had been involved in the interrogation of Feyzi Tatlı as well as the İkincisoy family members. However he could not remember the interrogation of the İkincisoy family members very clearly as it was almost six years ago. He recalled that upon receipt of intelligence to the effect that the two persons who had escaped the day before had been seen in a hut, an operation was conducted to apprehend them. The witness further took part in the operation together with 14 police officers. They were all wearing bullet proof vests. Before the armed clash, the officers asked the two persons to surrender but the two men started shooting at the officers. The clash lasted for about twenty minutes. They were about 15 metres away from the hut. No officer was wounded. When no-one returned their fire, the officers entered the hut and found two bodies. The hut was about ten square metres, it had a wooden door and a small window. Shortly after the armed clash, another team arrived and took photographs in the hut. The witness explained that he had never referred to this incident or showed the photographs to the İkincisoy family members during their interrogation.\r\n10.  Mustafa Atagun\r\n56.  The witness affirmed that he had been the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor from December 1993 to September 1995. He recalled that he had taken a statement from the first applicant concerning his application to the European Commission of Human Rights on 6 June 1995. The witness explained that, by a letter dated 24 May 1995 from the International Law and Foreign Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Justice, he was instructed to take the applicant's statement concerning his application to Strasbourg and to verify certain signatures on some documents. Accordingly, he had written to the Diyarbakır Security Department to notify the applicant that he was called to the office of the public prosecutor. The public prosecutor stated that the applicant had come to his office alone, of his own free will. No police officer had accompanied him to the public prosecutor's office. His statement was taken in the office of the clerks and not in the interrogation room. While they were in the office, the applicant seemed relaxed. The public prosecutor showed him certain documents, which were annexed to the letter from the Ministry. While accepting that these signatures belonged to him, the applicant stated that he did not remember signing these documents. The public prosecutor further recalled that the applicant had clearly stated that he did not want any foreign lawyers to make any applications before international bodies. The public prosecutor wrote down everything the applicant told him and read it out. The applicant accordingly signed his statement. The public prosecutor further admitted that he had not taken any steps to investigate the complaint, mentioned in the applicant's statement, that he had been ill-treated in custody and that his ribs had been broken.\r\nII.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\r\n57.  A full description of the relevant domestic law may be found in Tanli v. Turkey (no. 26129/95, §§ 92-105, ECHR 2001-III) and Dalkılıç v. Turkey (no. 25756/94, §§ 15-16, 5 December 2002).\r\nTHE LAW\r\nI.  THE COURT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE EVIDENCE AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FACTS\r\nA.  Arguments of the parties\r\n1.  The applicants\r\n58.  The applicants mainly argued that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy had died as a result of torture at the hands of police officers at the Diyarbakır Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters.\r\n2.  The Government\r\n59.  The Government denied the applicants' version of the facts and maintained that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy had been killed in a clash on 23 November 1993.\r\nB.  General principles\r\n60.  The Court recalls that, in assessing evidence, it adopts the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Orhan v. Turkey, no. 25656/94, § 264, 18 June 2002). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court's task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic authorities and, as a general rule, it is for those authorities to assess the evidence before them (see Klaas v. Germany, judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, § 29). Though the Court is not bound by the latter's findings, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact they have reached (ibid., p. 18, § 30). In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, § 161).\r\nC.  The Court's evaluation of evidence and establishment of the facts\r\n61.  The Court observes in the first place that the documentary evidence and the witnesses' oral testimony are in the main consistent as regards the general account of the events. The respondent state accepted that on 22 November 1993 a police team composed of five police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Diyarbakır Security Directorate conducted a search in the first applicant's apartment. Their aim was to find Mehmet Şah İkincisoy and to take him to the police headquarters for interrogation in connection with an ongoing investigation. When they were informed that Mehmet Şah was staying at his uncle's house, the police officers took the second applicant as a guide and left the first applicant's apartment. The Government further agreed that when the officers had arrived at Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment, one of the police officers stayed at the entrance of the building and two officers went inside the apartment together with the second applicant. They were informed that Mehmet Şah was there, together with his two friends. The two officers then started to interrogate them in a room and one of the men who was staying with Mehmet Şah shot and killed one of the police officers. These facts are also in conformity with the testimonies of Abdurrazak , Halil, Nasır and Garipşah İkincisoy before the Delegates. The Court has carefully examined these testimonies and compared them with the statements taken from the two police officers who had participated in the operation. Accordingly, it accepts the above account as the true facts of the case until the killing of the first police officer.\r\n62.  The Court further observes that the parties have divergent accounts concerning the events that took place following the shooting in Abdülkadir İkincisoy's apartment. The İkincisoy family members, who were in Abdülkadir's apartment, stated that subsequent to the shooting of the police officer, the second officer grabbed Mehmet Şah and dragged him downstairs (see paragraphs 45 and 47). This fact is also confirmed by officers Hünelitürkoğlu and Akay, who maintained that officer Hünerlitürkoğlu used Mehmet Şah as a shield. However it is maintained that when the second officer was shot, Mehmet Şah had escaped (see in this respect paragraphs 49-50). The witnesses and the custody records submitted by the Government revealed that subsequent to the shooting, all family members who had been present in Abdülkadir's and Abdurrazak's  apartments had been taken into custody (see paragraphs 25, 43, 45, 47 and 48). Although the İkincisoy family members argued that they were first taken to the Çarşı Police Station and then to the Rapid Intervention Force (see paragraphs 43, 46 and 48), the officers denied this submission, insisting that the arrested persons had been directly taken to the Rapid Intervention Headquarters for interrogation (see paragraphs 52 and 54).\r\n63.  The Court observes that in their testimonies Abdurrazak1, Halil, Nasır and Garipşah İkincisoy maintained that they had seen Mehmet Şah in the Çarşı Police Station and heard his voice at the Rapid Intervention Force. The Court notes that the testimony of the applicants and their witnesses essentially reiterated the content of their written statements. They submitted important details such as a description of his clothes and of the place where they had last seen him. On the other hand, the Government denied that Mehmet Şah had been detained by the police officers. They argued that he had escaped after the shooting of the second officer and died the day after in an armed clash. The Government witnesses further referred to the custody records which did not contain the name of Mehmet Şah, whereas it contained the names of all the rest of the İkincisoy family members who had been detained that night. The Court must therefore examine whether these custody records can be regarded as irrefutable evidence that Mehmet Şah had not been detained. It recalls both its own findings and those of the Commission as to the general inadequacy and unreliability of custody records (see İrfan Bilgin v. Turkey, no. 25659/94, § 130, ECHR 2001 VIII, Çakıcı v. Turkey [GC], no. 23657/94, § 105, ECHR 1999-IV, and Aydın v. Turkey, judgment of 25 September 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI, p. 1941, § 172). Concluding that such records cannot in general be relied upon to prove that a person was not taken into custody, the Court considers that the fact that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy's name was not in the custody record at the Diyarbakır Security Directorate does not itself prove that he was not in custody.\r\n64.  On the other hand, the Court observes that the testimonies of Abdurrazak1, Halil, Nasır and Garipşah İkincisoy, who were detained at the Rapid Intervention Force, were balanced, detailed and consistent with each other. It therefore accepts the evidence of the four witnesses who stated that they had seen Mehmet Şah when they were themselves being held on the same premises.\r\n65.  The Court accordingly concludes that Mehmet Şah was taken into custody on 22 November 1993 and that he was subsequently shot dead.\r\n66.  On the basis of these findings, the Court will proceed to examine the applicants' complaints under the various Articles of the Convention.\r\nII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONVENTION\r\nA.  General principles\r\n67.  Article 2, which safeguards the right to life and sets out the circumstances when deprivation of life may be justified, ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, to which no derogation is permitted. Together with Article 3, it also enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe. The circumstances in which deprivation of life may be justified must therefore be strictly construed. The object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings also requires that Article 2 be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, §§ 146-147).\r\n68.  In the light of the importance of the protection afforded by Article 2, the Court must subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, taking into consideration not only the actions of State agents but also all the surrounding circumstances. Detained persons are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Consequently, where an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused (see, amongst other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, § 87, ECHR 1999-V). The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of a detained individual is particularly stringent where that individual dies or disappears thereafter (Orhan, cited above, § 326).\r\n69.  Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in detention, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (see Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 100, ECHR 2000-VII, Çakıcı, cited above, § 85, Ertak v. Turkey, no. 20764/92, § 32, ECHR 2000-V, Timurtaş v. Turkey, no. 23531/94, § 82, ECHR 2000-VI, and Orhan, cited above, § 327).\r\nB.  Alleged failure to protect the right to life\r\n70.  The Court has accepted above (paragraph 65) that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was taken into custody on 22 November 1993 and died on 23 November 1993 while he was under the control of the security authorities of the respondent state.\r\n71.  The Court draws very strong inferences from the lack of any documentary evidence indicating that Mehmet Şah was taken into custody. It has held in its earlier judgments that an unacknowledged detention would be life-threatening in the general context of the situation in south-east Turkey in 1993 (see Taş v. Turkey, no. 24396/94, § 66, 14 November 2000, Çiçek v. Turkey, no. 25704/94, § 146, 27 February 2001, and Timurtaş, cited above, § 85).\r\n72.  Furthermore, as explained below (see paragraph 79), the autopsy examination, which had critical importance in determining the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, was defective in fundamental aspects. In this respect, the Court is further struck by the refusal of the domestic authorities to deliver Mehmet Şah's body to his family, who intended to request a detailed autopsy.\r\n73.  The Court therefore concludes that it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt that Mehmet Şah died during a clash. The authorities have thus failed to establish the real circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah, who was under their custody.\r\n74.  In view of the above, the Court concludes that Mehmet Şah was deprived of his life in circumstances engaging the responsibility of the respondent State. There is nothing to suggest that this was necessary for any of the reasons set out in the second paragraph of Article 2 of the Convention.\r\n75.  There has therefore been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in that respect.\r\nC.  Alleged inadequacy of the investigation\r\n76.  The Court reiterates that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention, read in conjunction with the State's general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within [its] jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in [the] Convention”, also requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force (see, mutatis mutandis, McCann and Others, cited above, § 161, and Kaya v. Turkey, judgment of 19 February 1998, Reports 1998-I, § 105). The essential purpose of such investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. What form of investigation will achieve those purposes may vary in different circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion, once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next of kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigatory procedures (see, for example, mutatis mutandis, İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 63, ECHR 2000-VII).\r\n77.  For an investigation into an alleged unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events (Güleç v. Turkey, judgment of 27 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV, §§ 81-82, and Oğur v. Turkey [GC], no. 21594/93, §§ 91-92, ECHR 1999-III). The investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used in such cases was or was not justified in the circumstances (Kaya, cited above, § 87) and to the identification and punishment of those responsible (Oğur, cited above, § 88). This is not an obligation of result, but of means. The authorities must have taken the reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eye-witness testimony (see, concerning witnesses, for example, Tanrıkulu v. Turkey [GC], no. 23763/94, § 109, ECHR 1999 IV). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person responsible will risk falling foul of this standard (Orhan, cited above, § 355).\r\n78.  Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that the investigation conducted by the public prosecutor was defective in a number of fundamental aspects. The Court is struck by the heavy reliance placed by the public prosecutor, who investigated the death of Mehmet Şah, on the conclusion of the incident report dated 23 November 1993. According to this incident report an intense clash had taken place which lasted for twenty minutes. Furthermore, according to the ballistic report 251 bullet cases had been recovered from the place of the incident. However it does not appear from the file whether the public prosecutor compared the facts as stated in the incident report with the photographs of the hut taken after the incident. The public prosecutor appears to have excluded the possibility that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah could have been different than those stated in the incident report. In this respect, it should also be recalled that the applicants had brought to the public prosecutor's attention the possibility that Mehmet Şah could have been killed under torture. Without taking statements from the family members of the deceased who were also arrested that day or the police officers who were involved in the clash, the public prosecutor concluded that Mehmet Şah had died during a clash.\r\n79.  It further appears from the autopsy report that Mehmet Şah was shot from behind by a bullet which entered from the upper part of his shoulder and exited from below his chest. It is striking that the public prosecutor did not seek any further explanation as to how a person involved in an intense clash could be shot from behind and most probably by a person who was standing above him. The Court also observes in this context that the autopsy report lacked valuable and important information which would clarify the circumstance surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah. The absence of any indication about the approximate positions of the person who fired and the victim and the distance between them at the moment of the shot as well as the size of the bullet entry and exit wounds constitute important deficiencies.\r\n80.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the investigation cannot be considered to have been effective as required by Article 2 of the Convention. It accordingly holds that there has been a violation of Article 2 on this account also.\r\nIII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION IN RESPECT OF MEHMET ŞAH İKİNCİSOY\r\n81.  The applicants complained that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was tortured before his death, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, which provides:\r\n“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”\r\n82.  The applicants submitted that Mehmet Şah had been tortured in custody. They maintained in this respect that several members of the İkincisoy family had heard his screams at the rapid Intervention Force Headquarters.\r\n83.  The applicants further alleged a breach of Article 3 of the Convention as a result of the anguish they have suffered due to their inability to learn the true circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah.\r\n84.  The Government submitted that the applicants' allegation was untrue and unsubstantiated.\r\n85.  The Court refers to its finding above where it has established that Mehmet Şah had died while he was under the control of the domestic authorities (see paragraph 65). However contrary to the applicants' allegations of torture, it observes from the photographs and the autopsy report that there were no marks or injuries on the body of Mehmet Şah which were consistent with the allegations of torture. It notes that the applicants' allegations of torture are solely based on the assumption that some of the persons who were detained in the Rapid Intervention Force Headquarters had heard the cries of Mehmet Şah. On the basis of the material in its possession and noting that the allegation of ill-treatment is not corroborated by any other evidence, the Court notes that the applicants' complaints are based on hypothesis and speculation rather than on reliable evidence.\r\n86.  In these circumstances, and having regard to its conclusion under Article 2 of the Convention, the Court does not find it appropriate to draw inferences proposed by the applicants as to whether torture or ill-treatment occurred (see, in this respect, Tanlı, cited above, § 159).\r\n87.  As regards the applicants' submission concerning the effects of the events on themselves, the Court has no doubt of the profound suffering caused by the death of Mehmet Şah. It finds no basis however for finding a violation of Article 3 in this context.\r\n88.  The Court finds that it has not been established that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. It consequently finds no violation of that provision.\r\nIV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n89.  The applicants alleged that their police custody breached Article 5 §§ 1 (c), 3, 4 and 5 of the Convention, which provide:\r\n“1.  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\r\n...\r\n(c)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\r\n3.  Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\r\n4.  Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\r\n5.  Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.”\r\nA.  Concerning the police custody of Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy\r\n90.  The applicants contended that the first applicant's four children, Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy, had not been brought promptly before a judge. In this respect they invoked Article 5 of the Convention.\r\n91.  In so far as the applicants complain about the police custody of Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy, the Court recalls in the first place that the term victim in Article 34 of the Convention denotes the person directly affected by the act or the omission which is at issue (see Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p.30, § 66).\r\n92.  The Court observes that the two applicants are not personally concerned by the detention of these four persons. Furthermore, they cannot substantiate the reason why these persons have themselves refrained from lodging applications with the Court.\r\n93.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that the applicants cannot claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention regarding the police custody of Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy.\r\nB.  Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention\r\n94.  The applicants contended that their arrests were arbitrary and unlawful, in breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.\r\n95.  The Court reiterates that the “reasonableness” of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 § 1 (c). Having a reasonable suspicion presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence (Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26775/95, § 155, ECHR 2000-IV). What may be regarded as reasonable will however depend on all the circumstances (see Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 16, § 32).\r\n96.  The Court recalls in particular that the reasonable suspicion referred to in Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention does not mean that the suspected person's guilt must at that stage be established. It is precisely the purpose of the investigation that the reality and nature of the offences laid against the accused should definitely be proved (see Murray v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300 A, p. 27, § 55). Sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 § 1 does not even presuppose that the police should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while the applicant was in custody (see Erdagöz v. Turkey, judgment of 22 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2314, § 51).\r\n97.  In the instant case the Court observes that the applicants were taken into custody, on suspicion of aiding and abetting the PKK and for being involved in the events which resulted in the killing of a police officer and the wounding of another. The Court is therefore satisfied that there were reasonable and sufficient grounds to believe that the applicants had been involved in an offence. It has examined these elements and has not disclosed any manifestly unreasonable or arbitrary conclusions drawn by the competent authorities from them. It thus sees no reason to doubt that the elements of which the authorities disposed were sufficient to believe, at that time, that the applicants had been involved in an offence.\r\n98.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.\r\nC.  Article 5 § 3 of the Convention\r\n99.  Under Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, the applicants complained that they were not brought promptly before a judge.\r\n100.  The Court recalls that Article 5, in general, aims to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the State with his right to liberty. Article 5 § 3 intends to avoid the arbitrariness and to secure the rule of law by requiring a judicial control of the interference by the executive (see Sakık and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 26 November 1997, Reports 1997-VII, p. 2623, § 44).\r\n101.  To be in accordance with Article 5 § 3, judicial control must be prompt. Promptness has to be assessed in each case according to its special features (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink v. the Netherlands, judgment of 22 May 1984, Series A no. 77, pp. 24-25, §§ 51-52). However, the scope of flexibility in interpreting and applying the notion of promptness is very limited (Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145 B, pp. 33-34, § 62).\r\n102.  The Court has accepted on several occasions that the investigation of terrorist offences undoubtedly presents the authorities with special problems (see the following judgments: Brogan and Others, cited above, p. 33, § 61, Murray, cited above, p. 27, § 58, Aksoy v. Turkey, judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2282, § 78, and Demir and Others v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998-VI, p. 2653, § 41). This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts and, ultimately, by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (see Murray, cited above, p. 27, § 58).\r\n103.  Concerning the police custody of the first applicant, the Court recalls that the fact that a detained person is not charged or brought before a court does not in itself amount to a violation of the first part of Article 5 § 3. No violation of Article 5 § 3 can arise if the arrested person is released “promptly” before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible (see De Jong, Baljet and Van den Brink, cited above, p. 25, § 52, and Brogan and Others, cited above, pp. 31-2, § 58). The Court finds that the release of the first applicant, who was held in police custody for no more than three days, may be regarded as “prompt” for these purposes. Accordingly, there has been no violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in his case.\r\n104.  As to the length of the police custody of the second applicant, the Court observes that he was held in police custody for eleven days from 22 November to 3 December 1993. It recalls that in the Brogan and Others case it held that detention in police custody which had lasted four days and six hours without judicial control fell outside the strict constraints as to the time laid down by Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, even though its purpose was to protect the community as a whole against terrorism (see Brogan and Others, cited above, p. 33, § 62).\r\n105.  Even though the investigation of terrorist offences, as supposed in this case, presents the authorities with special problems, the Court cannot accept that it was necessary to detain the second applicant for eleven days without judicial intervention.\r\n106.  Therefore the Court concludes that there has been a breach of Article 5 § 3 in respect of the second applicant.\r\nD.  Article 5 § 4 of the Convention\r\n107.  The applicants complained that they had not been able to take proceedings to have the lawfulness of their detention decided by a judge.\r\n108.  Concerning the first applicant, the Court recalls its finding under Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 103) that he was released before any judicial control of his detention would have been feasible and concludes that there has accordingly been no violation of Article 5 § 4 in respect of the first applicant.\r\n109.  Concerning the second applicant, the Court notes that a judge did not intervene until the end of his police custody, that is to say eleven days after his arrest. Having regard to the conclusion it reached with regard to Article 5 § 3 (see paragraph 106), the Court considers that such a lengthy period sits ill with the notion of “speedily” (see Sakık and Others, cited above, § 53). In conclusion, there has been a breach of Article 5 § 4 of the convention in respect of the second applicant.\r\nE.  Article 5 § 5 of the Convention\r\n110.  Lastly, the applicants alleged that, in breach of Article 5 § 5, under Turkish law it was not possible for them to claim compensation for a violation of Article 5 in the domestic courts.\r\n111.  In respect of the first applicant, the Court reiterates that this provision guarantees an enforceable right to compensation only to those who have been the victims of arrest or detention contrary to Article 5 of the Convention (see Benham v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, p. 755, § 50). In the absence of any such finding in the present case, the Court is of the opinion that there is no violation of Article 5 § 5 in respect of the first applicant.\r\n112.  As regards the second applicant who was held in custody for eleven days, the Court notes that the domestic legislation which was in force at the time of the events permitted police custody up to fifteen days without being brought before a judge. Accordingly, a compensation request for police custody which lasted for eleven days would not succeed before the domestic courts. The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant.\r\nV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n113.  The applicants further complained that there was no effective investigation into Mehmet Şah's death and that they were denied access to a court, in violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which in relevant part, provides as follows:\r\n“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] tribunal ...”\r\n114.  The Court observes that the essence of the applicants' complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention concerns the domestic authorities failure to mount an effective criminal investigation into Mehmet Şah's death. In the Court's view, it is therefore more appropriate to examine the applicants' Article 6 complaint in relation to the more general obligation on Contracting States under Article 13 of the Convention to provide an effective remedy in respect of violations of the Convention (see, amongst other authorities, Kaya, cited above, p. 329, § 105 and Aksoy, cited above, p. 286, § 93).\r\n115.  It accordingly does not find it necessary to determine whether there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1.\r\nVI.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 8, 9 AND 14 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n116.  The applicants complained that the search which was conducted in their house on 22 November 1993 constituted a breach of Article 8 of the Convention. They further alleged a breach of Article 9 of the Convention referring to their inability to open the grave of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy. Finally, they invoked Article 14 of the Convention alleging that they had been subjected to discrimination because of their Kurdish origin.\r\n117.  The Government did not address these issues beyond denying the factual basis of the complaints.\r\n118.  The Court has examined the applicants' allegations in the light of the evidence submitted to it, and considers them unsubstantiated. There has therefore been no violation of these provisions.\r\nVIII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n119.  The applicants asserted that they had been denied access to an effective domestic remedy and alleged a breach of Article 13 of the Convention, which provides:\r\n“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”\r\n120.  The applicants complained that despite the fact that they had lodged petitions with the public prosecutor to ensure that the allegations of torture and the death of Mehmet Şah were properly investigated, no effective investigation had been conducted into the circumstances of the death.\r\n121.  The Government alleged that there had been no shortcomings in the investigation concerning the killing of Mehmet Şah.\r\n122.  As the Court has held many times, Article 13 guarantees the availability at the national level of a remedy to enforce the substance of the Convention rights and freedoms in whatever form they might happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. The effect of Article 13 is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief, although Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they conform to their Convention obligations under this provision. The scope of the obligation under Article 13 varies depending on the nature of the applicant's complaint under the Convention. Nevertheless, the remedy required by Article 13 must be “effective” in practice as well as in law, in particular in the sense that its exercise must not be unjustifiably hindered by the acts or the omissions of the authorities of the respondent State (Aksoy, cited above, § 95, Aydın, cited above, § 103, and Kaya, cited above, § 89).\r\n123.  The nature of the rights safeguarded under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention has implications for Article 13. Where there is an arguable claim that an individual has been tortured or subjected to serious ill-treatment, or deprived of his or her life, by agents of the State, Article 13 requires, in addition to the payment of compensation where appropriate, a thorough and effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the treatment in question or the deprivation of life, including effective access for the complainant to the investigation procedure (Salman, cited above, § 121).\r\n124.  On the basis of the evidence adduced in the present case, the Court has found that the Government are responsible under Article 2 of the Convention for the death of Mehmet Şah while he was under custody. The applicants' complaints in this regard are therefore “arguable” for the purposes of Article 13 (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A no. 131, p. 23, § 52, and Kaya, cited above, § 107).\r\n125.  The authorities thus had an obligation to carry out an effective investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy. For the reasons set out above (see paragraphs 78-80), no effective criminal investigation can be considered to have been conducted in accordance with Article 13, the requirements of which may be broader than the obligation to investigate imposed by Articles 2 and 3 (Kaya, cited above, pp. 330-331, § 107, Salman, cited above, § 123, and Nuray Şen v. Turkey (no. 2), no. 25354/94, § 193, 30 March 2004).\r\n126.  The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention.\r\nX.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF FORMER ARTICLE 25 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n127.  The applicants complained that there had been a serious interference with the exercise of their right of individual petition, in breach of Article 25 of the Convention (now replaced by Article 34), which provides as follows:\r\n“The Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.”\r\n128.  The applicants submitted that on 6 June 1995 the first applicant was taken before the public prosecutor for interrogation concerning his application with the Commission. He was questioned about his individual application and was asked whether the signatures on the letter of authority and his statement to the Human Rights Association belonged to him. The first applicant had to sign his statement under pressure and stated that he would retract his application.\r\n129.  The Government denied these assertions. They insisted that the authorities had never brought pressure on the applicants to withdraw their application to the Convention organs.\r\n130.  The Court recalls that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of the individual petition instituted by former Article 25 (now replaced by Article 34) that applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Convention organs without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see Şarli v. Turkey, no. 24490/94, § 84, 22 May 2001). In this context, “pressure” includes not only direct coercion and flagrant acts of intimidation but also other improper indirect acts or contacts designed to dissuade or discourage applicants from pursuing a convention remedy.\r\n131.  Turning to the facts of the instant case, the Court observes that it is accepted by the parties that the applicant was indeed interviewed by the public prosecutor on 6 June 1995 as alleged upon the instructions of the Ministry of Justice International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate concerning his application with the Commission (see paragraphs 39 and 56).\r\n132.  The Court therefore finds that the applicant was subjected to indirect and improper pressure to make statements in respect of his application to the Commission which interfered with the free exercise of his right of individual petition guaranteed under Article 25.\r\n133.  The Court accordingly holds that the respondent State has failed to comply with its obligations under former Article 25 of the Convention.\r\nXI.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\r\n134.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:\r\n“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”\r\nA.  Pecuniary Damage\r\n135.  The applicants submitted that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was twenty- two years old and had worked as a livestock trader before his death. Although he did not have a stable income, he had an average annual income of 3,000,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). Taking into account his age and average life expectancy in Turkey, the calculation according to Ogden actuarial method resulted in the capitalised sum of 68,010.40 pounds sterling (GBP).\r\n136.  The Government claimed that the allegations were unsubstantiated and that there was no basis for awarding compensation. In any event, they submitted that the sum claimed was excessive.\r\n137.  The Court notes that Mehmet Şah İkincisoy was unmarried and had no children. It is not claimed that the applicants were in any way dependent on him. In the present case, the claims for pecuniary damage relate to alleged loss of earnings accruing subsequent to the death of the first applicant's son and the second applicant's brother. The Court notes that the applicants have not proved that they suffered the pecuniary loss they alleged. The Court does not find it appropriate in the circumstances of this case to make any award to the applicants under this head.\r\nB.  Non-pecuniary damage\r\n1.  Concerning the death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy\r\n138.  The applicants claimed, having regard to the seriousness and number of violations, GBP 40,000 in respect of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy and GBP 2,500 each in respect of the suffering they had to face due to their inability to learn the exact circumstances surrounding the death of Mehmet Şah.\r\n139.  The Government requested the refusal of the applicants' claims.\r\n140.  The Court considers that an award should be made in respect of non-pecuniary damage bearing in mind the seriousness of the violations which it has found in respect of Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention concerning the death of Mehmet Şah.\r\n141.  Accordingly, having regard to the sums which it has awarded in comparable cases and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards 25,000 euros (EUR) for non-pecuniary damage, such sum to be held by the applicants for the heirs of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy.\r\n142.  The Court accepts that the applicants have themselves suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated solely by the findings of violations. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards EUR 3,500 to each of the applicants.\r\n2.  Concerning the police custody of the second applicant\r\n143. The second applicant claimed the sum of GBP 10,000 for non-pecuniary damage in respect of his detention for a period of eleven days before being brought before the public prosecutor.\r\n144.  The Government did not make any comments on this point.\r\n145.  The Court recalls its finding above and considers that the second applicant should be awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage since he must have suffered distress, fear and anxiety considering that he was kept in police custody for eleven days without any judicial intervention. Deciding on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41, the Court awards him the sum of EUR 4,000.\r\n3.  Summary\r\n146.  Accordingly, the following amounts are awarded to the applicants by way of non-pecuniary compensation, all sums to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment:\r\n(a)  EUR 25,000 to both applicants to be held by them for the heirs of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy;\r\n(b)  EUR 3,500 to each of the applicants;\r\n(c)  EUR 4,000 to the second applicant.\r\nC.  Punitive or exemplary damages\r\n147.  In relation to the interference with the exercise of the applicants' right of individual petition, in breach of Article 25 of the Convention (now replaced by Article 34), the applicants requested the Court to rule for an exemplary punitive damage.\r\n148.  The Government denied these assertions.\r\n149.  The Court notes that in a number of recent Grand Chamber cases it has rejected requests by applicants for exemplary and punitive damages (see Orhan, cited above, § 448, Selçuk and Asker v. Turkey, judgment of 24 April 1998, Reports 1998-II, p. 918, § 119, and Lustig-Prean and Beckett v. the United Kingdom, nos. 31417/98 and 32377/96, §§ 22-23, 27 September 1999).\r\n150.  The Court therefore dismisses the applicants' claim under this head.\r\nD.  Costs and expenses\r\n151.  Finally, submitting a schedule of costs, the applicants claimed a total sum of GBP 14,446.58 for costs and expenses. These claims comprised:\r\n(a)\tGBP 4,355 for fees of United Kingdom-based lawyers;\r\n(b)\tGBP 105.60 for administrative costs incurred by the United Kingdom-based lawyers;\r\n(c)\tGBP 1,380 for administrative costs incurred by the Kurdish Human Rights Project (“KHRP”);\r\n(d)\tGBP 1,485 for translations carried out by the KHRP;\r\n(e)\tGBP 6,750 for fees of Turkish lawyers\r\n(f)\tGBP 370.98 for costs incurred by Turkish lawyers\r\n152.  The Government considered these claims exorbitant and unsubstantiated. They disputed that any sum should be awarded in respect of the role of the KHRP, which organisation could be categorised neither as an applicant nor as a representative.\r\n153.  The Court reiterates that only legal costs and expenses necessarily and actually incurred can be reimbursed under Article 41 of the Convention. Furthermore, the amounts claimed must be reasonable as to quantum. It notes in this connection that the present case involved complex issues of fact and law requiring detailed examination, including the taking of evidence from witnesses in Ankara. However, the Court is not satisfied that in the instant case all the costs and expenses were necessarily and actually incurred.\r\n154.  Making its own estimate based on the information available, the Court awards the applicants in respect of costs and expenses EUR 15,000 exclusive of any value-added tax that may be chargeable, such sum to be converted into pounds sterling and paid into the applicants' representatives' bank account in the United Kingdom as set out in their just satisfaction claim.\r\nE.  Default interest\r\n155.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\r\n\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in relation to Mehmet Şah İkincisoy's death;\r\n\r\n2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention on account of the failure of the authorities of the respondent State to conduct an effective investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy;\r\n\r\n3.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n4.  Holds that it is unnecessary to determine whether there has been a breach of Article 6 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n5.  Holds that the applicants cannot claim to be victims within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention regarding Hüseyin, Makbule, Nefise and Garipşah İkincisoy's complaints under Article 5 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n6.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 5 §§ 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Convention in respect of the first applicant;\r\n\r\n7.  Holds that there has been no violation of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant;\r\n\r\n8.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant;\r\n\r\n9.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant;\r\n\r\n10.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 5 of the Convention in respect of the second applicant;\r\n\r\n11.  Holds that there has been no violation of Articles 8, 9 and 14 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n12.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n13.  Holds that the respondent State has failed to comply with its obligations under former Article 25 § 1 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.  Holds\r\n(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicants, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts free of any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into Turkish liras at the rate applicable at the date of payment and to be paid into the bank account in Turkey indicated by the applicants:\r\n(i)  EUR 25,000 (twenty-five thousand euros) in respect of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy, which sum is to be held by the applicants for the heirs of Mehmet Şah İkincisoy;\r\n(ii)  EUR 3,500 (three thousand five hundred euros) to each of the applicants in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\r\n(iii)  EUR 4,000 (four thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage to the second applicant concerning his police custody;\r\n(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\r\n\r\n15.  Holds\r\n(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicants' representatives, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 15,000 (fifteen thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses, exclusive of any value added tax that may be chargeable to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate applicable at the date of settlement and paid into the bank account in the United Kingdom indicated by the applicants;\r\n(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\r\n\r\n16.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicants' claim for just satisfaction.\r\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 27 July 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\r\n\tMichael O'BOYLE\tJosep CASADEVALL\r\n\tRegistrar\tPresident\r\n",

AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n(Application no. 16718/90)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n23 October 1995 \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the case of Palaoro v. Austria  , \r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A  , as a Chamber composed of the following judges: \r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tF. MATSCHER, \r\n\tMr \tL.-E. PETTITI, \r\n\tMr \tR. MACDONALD, \r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS, \r\n\tMr \tI. FOIGHEL, \r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND, \r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK, \r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, \r\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 April and 28 September 1995,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 9 September 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 16718/90) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by an Austrian national, Mr Peter Palaoro, on 28 May 1990. \r\nThe Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.  \r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).  \r\n3.   On 24 September 1994, the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to hear the instant case and the cases of Schmautzer, Umlauft, Gradinger, Pramstaller and Pfarrmeier v. Austria  . \r\n4.   The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Mr F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L. E. Pettiti, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Sir John Freeland and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).  \r\n5.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Austrian Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's memorial on 24 January 1995 and the applicant's memorial on 30 January 1995. \r\n6.   On 3 February 1995 the Commission produced the documents in the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President's instructions.  \r\n7.   In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 April 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. \r\nThere appeared before the Court:  \r\n(a) for the Government  \r\n\t\tMr F. CEDE, Ambassador, Head of the International \r\n\t\t\tLaw Department, Federal Ministry of \r\n\t\t\tForeign Affairs, \tAgent,\r\n\t\tMs I. SIEß, Constitutional Department, \r\n\t\t\tFederal Chancellery, \r\n\t\tMs E. BERTAGNOLI, International Law Department, \r\n\t\t\tFederal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission  \r\n\t\tMr A. WEITZEL,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant  \r\n\t\tMr W.L. WEH, Rechtsanwalt,\tCounsel. \r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Weitzel, Mr Weh and Mr Cede.  \r\nAS TO THE FACTS  \r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE  \r\n8.   Mr  lives at Höchst in Vorarlberg.  \r\n9.   On 7 November 1987 a police car observed the applicant driving on the motorway at speeds considerably in excess of the maximum speed limits.  At 14.28 hours and 53 seconds he was recorded travelling at 150 kilometres per hour on a stretch of road where a sign indicated the limit to be 100 k.p.h.  Thirty-one seconds later he was recorded travelling at 67 k.p.h. over the general 130 k.p.h. limit for motorways.  The applicant alleged that as the vehicle he was driving was an extremely powerful one, it was difficult for the driver to realise at what speed it was actually travelling. \r\nOn 6 December 1987 the Tyrol regional police authority (Landesgendarmeriekommando) drew up a report and imposed two separate fines on the applicant for speeding.  \r\n10.   On 16 November 1988, after administrative proceedings which involved an examination of the reporting police officers (Meldungsleger) in the absence of the applicant, the Imst district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) found the applicant guilty of two speeding offences under the Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsordnung - see paragraph 17 below).  Pursuant to section 99(3) of that Act (see paragraph 18 below) the applicant was fined 4,000 and 6,000 Austrian schillings (ATS), with imprisonment of eight and ten days respectively in default of payment.  \r\n11.   The applicant appealed to the Tyrol regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), questioning the precision of the police methods for measuring vehicle speed.  He further contended that, having admitted driving at a high speed on a given stretch of road, he should not have been punished under two different provisions, which had resulted in an excessively high fine.  He therefore requested that the incident be treated as a single offence and the fine reduced accordingly.  \r\n12.   On 22 December 1988 the Tyrol regional government reduced the fines to ATS 2,000 and 4,000 respectively, and the penalties in default to four and seven days' imprisonment.  The appellate authority accepted, among other considerations, that speed-measuring techniques could not achieve total accuracy.  The submission that only one offence had been committed was dismissed on the ground that two different provisions had been infringed at two different moments in time.  \r\n13.   Mr Palaoro then applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof).  Relying on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, he complained that the administrative criminal procedure did not guarantee a fair trial.  He argued that he should have been given an oral hearing and the opportunity to examine the witnesses - that is to say the police officers - in person.  This would have allowed him to establish that the measuring methods used by the police were often defective.  He further criticised the \"principle of cumulative imposition of penalties\" (Kumulationsprinzip), by virtue of which the same criminal behaviour could be punished under different provisions.  In this context he referred to Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 ((P7-4) to the Convention.  \r\n14.   On 10 March 1989 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant's complaint partly inadmissible as raising questions concerning the application of ordinary law; in so far as the complaint did raise issues of constitutional law, the Constitutional Court, referring to its own case-law on the Convention, found that the application did not have sufficient prospects of success.  Among other provisions, Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution was applied (see paragraph 20 below).  \r\n15.   On 19 April 1989 Mr Palaoro requested the Constitutional Court to send his file to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) and on 15 June 1989 he submitted his grounds of appeal to the latter. He stressed that he should have had the opportunity to examine the witnesses directly and that he should not have been punished twice for what he considered to be a single offence. \r\nNo public hearing was requested.  \r\n16.   On 25 October 1989 the applicant's appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Court pursuant to section 42(1) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz - see paragraph 24 below). It noted that a formal confrontation with a witness was to be ordered only where it was necessary in the special circumstances of a given case: there was no general right to put questions in person to a witness (section 47 of the Administrative Criminal Justice Act).  The Administrative Court upheld the respondent authority's grounds for dismissing the applicant's second complaint (see paragraph 12 above).  \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW  \r\nA. Road traffic legislation  \r\n17.   Section 20(2) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 sets the maximum speed limit on motorways at 130 kilometres per hour. \r\nSection 52(A)(10)(a) of the same Act prohibits travelling in excess of the speed limit indicated on a road sign.  \r\n18.   Under section 99(3)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, breaches of its provisions are punishable with a fine of up to ATS 10,000, with imprisonment of up to two weeks in default of payment.  \r\nB. Procedure  \r\n19.   Article 90 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) provides: \r\n\"Hearings by trial courts in civil and criminal cases shall be oral and public.  Exceptions may be prescribed by law.\" \r\n1. Proceedings in the Constitutional Court  \r\n20.   By Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Constitutional Court, when an application (Beschwerde) is made to it, has to determine whether an administrative decision (Bescheid) has infringed a right guaranteed by the Constitution or has applied regulations (Verordnung) contrary to the law, a law contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law. \r\nArticle 144 para. 2 provides: \r\n\"Up to the time of the hearing the Constitutional Court may by means of a decision (Beschluß) decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it cannot be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law.  The court may not decline to accept for adjudication a case excluded from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court by Article 133.\"  \r\n2. Proceedings in the Administrative Court  \r\n21.   By Article 130 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear, inter alia, applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful.  \r\n22.   Section 39(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides, in particular, that at the end of the preliminary proceedings (Vorverfahren) the Administrative Court must hold a hearing where the applicant makes a request to that effect.  \r\nSection 39(2) reads as follows:  \r\n\"Notwithstanding a party's application under subsection (1), the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing where  \r\n1.   the proceedings must be stayed (section 33) or the application dismissed (section 34);  \r\n2.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction (section 42(2)(2));  \r\n3.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful on account of a breach of procedural rules (section 42(2)(3));  \r\n4.   the impugned decision must be quashed because its content is unlawful according to the established case-law of the Administrative Court;  \r\n5.   neither the respondent authority nor any other party before the court has filed pleadings in reply and the impugned decision is to be quashed;  \r\n6.   it is apparent to the court from the pleadings of the parties to the proceedings before it and from the files relating to the earlier administrative proceedings that a hearing is not likely to clarify the case further.\" \r\nSub-paragraphs 1 to 3 of section 39(2) were in force in 1958; sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 were inserted in 1964 and sub-paragraph 6 in 1982.  \r\n23.   Section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides:  \r\n\"In so far as the Administrative Court does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority's lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules (section 42(2)(2) and (3)) ..., it must examine the impugned decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward ... If it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on [one of these complaints] ..., it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary.\"  \r\n24.   Section 42(1) of the same Act states that, save as otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision.  \r\nBy section 42(2),  \r\n\"The Administrative Court shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful  \r\n1.   by reason of its content, [or]  \r\n2.   because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction, [or]  \r\n3.   on account of a breach of procedural rules, in that  \r\n(a) the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are, in an important respect, contradicted by the case file, or  \r\n(b) the facts require further investigation on an important point, or  \r\n(c) procedural rules have been disregarded, compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority.\"  \r\n25.   If the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision, \"the administrative authorities [are] under a duty ... to take immediate steps, using the legal means available to them, to bring about in the specific case the legal situation which corresponds to the Administrative Court's view of the law (Rechtsanschauung)\" (section 63(1)).  \r\n26.   In a judgment of 14 October 1987 (G 181/86) the Constitutional Court held:  \r\n\"From the fact that it has been necessary to extend the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention to cover the procedural safeguards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, because of the connection between those two provisions (art. 5, art. 6), it follows that, conversely, the limited review (die (bloß) nachprüfende Kontrolle) carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court is insufficient in respect of criminal penalties within the meaning of the Convention that are not covered by the reservation.\"  \r\n3. The \"independent administrative tribunals\"  \r\n27.   Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution, administrative courts called \"independent administrative tribunals\" (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate) were set up in the Länder with effect from 1 January 1991.  The functions of these tribunals include determining both the factual and the legal issues arising in cases concerning administrative offences (Verwaltungsübertretungen).  \r\nIII.   AUSTRIA'S RESERVATION IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE 5 (ART. 5) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n28.   The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by the Austrian Government on 3 September 1958 contains, inter alia, a reservation worded as follows:  \r\n\"The provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention shall be so applied that there shall be no interference with the measures for the deprivation of liberty prescribed in the laws on administrative procedure, BGBl [Federal Official Gazette] No. 172/1950, subject to review by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Austrian Federal Constitution.\"  \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION  \r\n29.   Mr Palaoro applied to the Commission on 28 May 1990.  He relied on Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (art. 6-1, art. 6-3) of the Convention and Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4), complaining (a) that he had been unable to bring his case before a tribunal, (b) that he had been denied the right to examine a witness in the administrative proceedings and (c) that he had been punished twice for the same offence.  \r\n30.   On 10 May 1993 the Commission declared the application (no. 16718/90) admissible save as regards the complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4). \r\nIn its report of 19 May 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that  \r\n(a) there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention in that the applicant had not been able to bring his case before a tribunal; and  \r\n(b) the lack of a hearing before the Administrative Court and the failure by the administrative authorities to allow the witnesses to be examined by the applicant raised no separate issue under Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention. \r\nThe full text of the Commission's opinion and of the concurring opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment  . \r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT  \r\n31.   In their memorial the Government asked the Court to hold that  \r\n\"Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention is not applicable in the present case; or alternatively, that Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention was not violated in the administrative criminal proceedings underlying the application\".  \r\nAS TO THE LAW  \r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n32.   The applicant complained of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ...\"  \r\nHe had, he maintained, been denied the right to a \"tribunal\" and to a hearing before such a body.  \r\nA. Applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)  \r\n1. Whether there was a \"criminal charge\"  \r\n33.   In Mr Palaoro's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a \"criminal charge\".  This was not disputed by the Government.  \r\n34.   In order to determine whether an offence qualifies as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention, it is first necessary to ascertain whether or not the provision (art. 6-1) defining the offence belongs, in the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next the \"very nature of the offence\" and the degree of severity of the penalty risked must be considered (see, among other authorities, the Öztürk v. Germany judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, p. 18, para. 50, and the Demicoli v. Malta judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, pp. 15-17, paras. 31-34).  \r\n35.   Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.  This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).  In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 18 above). \r\nThese considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that Article 6 (art. 6) applies. \r\n2. Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention  \r\n36.   According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.  There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to \"measures for the deprivation of liberty\" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures. Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison. \r\nAdmittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.  However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.  It mattered little in this respect that sections 20 and 52 of the Road Traffic Act, which were applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because those provisions merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Traffic Police Act 1947.  \r\n37.   The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.  In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"1.   Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision.  Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  \r\n2.   Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.\"  \r\nSecondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  \r\n38.   The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).  It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.  They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case. \r\nThe Court notes that Mr Palaoro based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.  Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.  Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied. \r\nThese considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.  \r\nB. Compliance with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) \r\n1. Access to a tribunal  \r\n39.   Mr Palaoro contended that none of the bodies that had dealt with his case in the proceedings in issue could be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.  The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above).  It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.  Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.  In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  \r\n40.   The Government contested this view, whereas the Commission accepted it.  \r\n41.   The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  \r\n42.   The Constitutional Court is not such a body.  In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts.  It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  \r\n43.   The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\".  These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.  As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of the Convention.  Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 26 above).  \r\n44.   It follows that the applicant did not have access to a \"tribunal\".  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point. \r\n2. Lack of a hearing and failure to take evidence from witnesses  \r\n45.   Mr Palaoro further criticised the Administrative Court for failing to hold a hearing or take evidence from witnesses.  \r\n46.   Having regard to the conclusion in paragraph 44 above, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine these complaints.  \r\nII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n47.   Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,  \r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"  \r\n48.   The Delegate of the Commission left the matter of just satisfaction to the discretion of the Court.  \r\nA. Damage  \r\n49.   In respect of pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed repayment of the fine imposed on him, that is to say ATS 6,600.  He also claimed ATS 6,000 for non-pecuniary damage.  \r\n50.   The Government contended that the Court had no jurisdiction to quash convictions pronounced by national courts or to order repayment of fines.  Moreover, it could not, in awarding reparation, speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if the applicant had had access to a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.  \r\n51.   The Court agrees.  It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47).  It considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the present judgment affords the applicant sufficient reparation.  \r\nB. Costs and expenses  \r\n52.   In addition, Mr Palaoro claimed the sum of ATS 204,039 for the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings first in the domestic courts and then before the Convention institutions.  \r\n53.   The Government expressed the view that only the proceedings in the Administrative Court - which had given rise to the alleged violations - and those in Strasbourg could be taken into account.  They also contested the quantum of the costs, but they were prepared to reimburse a total of ATS 300,000 in respect of the Umlauft, Pramstaller, Palaoro and Pfarrmeier cases, the applicants in all these cases having been represented by the same lawyer.  \r\n54.   Making an assessment on an equitable basis, having regard to the information in its possession and its case-law, the Court awards Mr Palaoro ATS 100,000.  \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY  \r\n1.   Holds that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention applies in this case;  \r\n\r\n2.   Holds that there has been a violation of that Article (art. 6-1) as regards access to a court;  \r\n\r\n3.   Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaints based on the lack of a hearing in the Administrative Court and that court's failure to take evidence from witnesses;  \r\n\r\n4.   Holds that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, 100,000 (one hundred thousand) Austrian schillings in respect of costs and expenses;  \r\n\r\n5.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.  \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 October 1995.  \r\n\r\n\t\tRolv RYSSDAL\r\n\t\tPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD \r\nRegistrar \r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the separate opinion of Mr Martens is annexed to this judgment.  \r\nR. R.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS\r\n1.   I concur in the Court's finding that Article 6 (art. 6) has been violated, but cannot agree with its reasoning.  \r\n2.   My objections concern paragraph 43 of the judgment, which starts with the statement:  \r\n\"The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.\"  \r\n3.   I will refrain from a structural criticism of this paragraph. I cannot help noting, however, that here again the Court finds it necessary to remark that when it is being assessed whether or not the Administrative Court is to be considered a court that affords the safeguards of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), \"regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court\".  One looks in vain, however, for evidence of this methodological principle being put into practice: there does not follow any analysis of what the applicant argued before the Administrative Court, nor is there any trace of \"regard\" to these arguments in the assessment of the adequacy of the Administrative Court's jurisdiction.  For the rest, I refer to the methodological objections to this \"test\" that I raised in paragraph 18 of my separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria (judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312).  \r\n4.   My main objection to this paragraph is the following.  In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.  One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"criminal\" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"civil\" one.  I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  .  Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument.  This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . \r\n",

BULGARIA\r\n\r\n(Application no. 21915/93)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n20 March 1997 \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the case of Lukanov v. Bulgaria ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr\tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr\tF. MATSCHER,\r\n\tMrs\tE. PALM,\r\n\tSir\tJohn FREELAND,\r\n\tMr\tJ. MAKARCZYK,\r\n\tMr\tD. GOTCHEV,\r\n\tMr\tB. REPIK,\r\n\tMr\tU. LOHMUS,\r\n\tMr\tJ. CASADEVALL,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 2 December 1996 and 20 February 1997,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 11 March 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 21915/93) against the Republic of Bulgaria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Bulgarian citizen, Mr Andrei Karlov Lukanov, on 1 September 1992. The applicant was shot dead on 2 October 1996.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Bulgaria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Articles 5 para. 1 and 18 of the Convention (art. 5-1, art. 18).\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr D. Gotchev, the elected judge of Bulgarian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 30 March 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mrs E. Palm, Mr F. Bigi, Sir John Freeland, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr U. Lohmus and Mr J. Casadevall (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr B. Repik, substitute judge, replaced Mr Bigi, who had died (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Deputy Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Bulgarian Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence on 5 July and 21 October 1996, the Registrar received the applicant’s memorial on 3 October 1996 and the Government’s written observations on 8 October and 12 November 1996. On 22 November 1996 the Secretary to the Commission indicated that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\r\n5.   Following the applicant’s death on 2 October 1996, the Registrar received on 5 October a declaration to the President of the Court to the effect that the applicant’s widow, Mrs Lilia Gerassimova-Lukanova, and two children, Ms Anna Andreeva Lukanova and Mr Karlo Andreev Lukanov, wished to pursue the proceedings on his behalf.\r\n6.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 November 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government\r\n\t\tMrs S. MARGARITOVA, Ministry of Justice,\tAgent;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr S. TRECHSEL,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\n\t\tMrs I. LOULTCHEVA, lawyer practising in Sofia,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr S.E. ENTCHEV,\tAssistant.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Trechsel, Mrs Loultcheva and Mrs Margaritova.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n7.   The applicant was a Bulgarian citizen. Formerly a Minister, then Deputy Prime Minister and, in 1990, Prime Minister of Bulgaria, he was a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly at the time of the events giving rise to the present case. On 2 October 1996 he was shot dead outside his home.\r\n8.   On leaving Sofia for Moscow on 7 March 1992, the applicant was informed by the border police at Sofia Airport that an order had been made to withdraw his diplomatic passport. As the order was not shown to him, he refused to hand over his passport. Following a similar incident on 11 March, the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which rejected the appeal on the ground that no administrative decision had been taken which could form the subject of an appeal. Subsequently, the applicant brought proceedings to obtain compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the unlawful order to withdraw his passport (see paragraph 24 below).\r\n9.   On 1 July 1992 the Prosecutor-General requested the National Assembly to authorise the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of having contravened Articles 203 and 219 para. 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 25 and 27 below). The suspicion related in particular to his participation as a Deputy Prime Minister between 1986 and 1990 in a number of decisions granting sums, totalling 34,594,500 US dollars (USD) and 27,072,000 convertible Bulgarian leva, in assistance and loans to certain developing countries, including Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos, Kampuchea, Afghanistan, Angola and Yemen. The request stated:\r\n\"The decisions ... have dramatically affected the country’s economic potential, its economic resources and export capacity, and have objectively speaking made it unable to repay its foreign debt. It should be emphasised that, due to decisions of this nature causing prejudice to the country and other illegal measures taken by party and government leaders during this period, our foreign debt rose from USD 4,119,700 in 1986 to USD 10,656,900,000 in 1989 ...\r\nThe situation described is covered by the definition of the offence of `taking advantage of one’s position’ in respect of very large amounts of money, which constitutes a particularly serious matter falling within the provisions in Article 203 and Article 219 para. 3 of the Criminal Code.\r\nThe offences mentioned are `serious’ within the meaning of Article 93 para. 7 of the Code.\"\r\n10.   On 7 July 1992 the National Assembly waived the applicant’s parliamentary immunity under Article 70 of the Bulgarian Constitution and authorised criminal proceedings against him and his arrest and detention on remand.\r\n11.   On 9 July 1992 the public prosecutor, Mr Doychev, of the Investigation Department of the Prosecutor-General’s Office, charged the applicant under Article 203, in conjunction with Articles 201, 202 and 282, of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 25 and 28 below) with having misappropriated, in concert with the chairperson and the other vice-chairpersons of the then Council of Ministers, the funds allocated to certain developing countries as mentioned in paragraph 9 above. In breach of his official duties, he had facilitated the misappropriation in order to obtain an advantage for a third party, thereby causing considerable economic damage. In view of the very large amounts of money involved, the case was a particularly serious one.\r\nThe prosecutor in addition ordered the applicant’s detention on remand, citing as grounds the need to show to the public the danger that the offences in question represented to society, the applicant’s identity and the need to secure his appearance before the trial court. The decision referred, inter alia, to Articles 147 and 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 29 and 30 below).\r\nOn 9 July 1992 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody at the premises of the National Investigation Service in Sofia.\r\n12.   On the same date the applicant’s lawyer lodged an appeal with the Bulgarian Supreme Court, requesting his release. She maintained that, contrary to Article 148 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the arrest warrant had failed to specify the grounds for his arrest. The fact that he risked a sentence of more than ten years’ imprisonment could not in itself justify his detention since, under paragraph 2 of Article 152, it was also a condition that there should be a risk of his absconding or of his committing a further crime (see paragraph 30 below). In addition, the measures had been taken on the basis of the applicant’s identity, notably the fact that he was a member of the National Assembly, a consideration which was not covered by any of the grounds that were exhaustively listed in Article 147 para. 1 (see paragraph 29 below).\r\n13.   At a court session held on 13 July 1992, at which the public prosecutor but not the applicant or his lawyer was present, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. Its decision included the following reasoning:\r\n\"Under Article 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure a suspect is to be detained on remand if the offence is punishable by ten years’ imprisonment or more or by the death penalty. Offences under Article 203 para. 1, of the Criminal Code carry such sentences.\r\n[The above provision] lays down two cumulative conditions - the misappropriation must have occurred on a large scale and must have been particularly serious.\r\n[Whether the misappropriation has occurred] on a particularly large scale depends on the value of the public property involved. The seriousness of the case is determined on the basis of whether the misappropriation was carried out with the complicity of others, the level of the threat to society involved in the [measures] and the subject matter (Article 93 para. 8, of the Criminal Code). The argument that the eventuality envisaged in Article 152 para. 2 ... applies in the instant case is unfounded.\r\nWhen the accusation was made the applicant was a member of the National Assembly. By virtue of Article 72 of the Bulgarian Constitution he holds this status until such circumstances occur as may warrant the suspension from his functions as a member of the National Assembly. In his capacity as member of the National Assembly the [applicant] represents the people as a whole. It is precisely in this capacity that the [risk] mentioned in Article 152 para. 2 ... will materialise, and the likelihood of this is greater than in the case of an appellant who is not a member of the National Assembly.\r\nFurthermore, the applicant has lodged a judicial appeal against the administrative measure resulting in the withdrawal of his diplomatic passport ... The fact that he has taken such a step gives good grounds for fearing that he will not refrain from committing acts of the type mentioned in Article 152 para. 2 ...\r\nAccording to Article 70 of the Constitution `..., except in cases of serious crimes and where permission has been given by the National Assembly, its members may not be detained and no charges may be brought against them ...’. A logical and systematic interpretation of the aforesaid provision suggests that [what is decisive for] the measure of restraint, `detention’, [to be applied] in the context of the Criminal Code is whether the act entails a great danger to society and the particular status of the person who has committed it - a member of the National Assembly.\r\nFor this reason the legislature envisaged ... detention in [such] cases. The prosecutor’s office has power to impose such a measure.\"\r\n14.   On 23 August 1992 the applicant was hospitalised at Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, where he received treatment.\r\n15.   On 4 September 1992 the applicant, relying on a change in circumstances concerning his state of health, filed a request with the Prosecutor-General for his release.\r\n16.   On 5 September 1992 his lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court against the Prosecutor-General’s implied refusal to grant the request of 4 September 1992.\r\nThe Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on 17 September 1992 on the grounds that the applicant had already appealed against his detention and that, under the relevant Bulgarian law, he was not entitled to lodge a further appeal.\r\n17.   Subsequently, the applicant’s lawyer made a request for his release to the public prosecutor.\r\nAt a meeting on 28 October 1992 between the public prosecutor and the applicant and his lawyer at the Military Hospital in Sofia, the lawyer invited the prosecutor to take a decision on the request for release. The applicant himself maintained that it was unreasonable to base his detention on the fact that he had complained about the withdrawal of his passport. He did not have any other passport. Nor was there any danger of his repeating the offence, as he was no longer in a position to do so.\r\nOn 2 November 1992 the public prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s request for release. He gave as reasons that the Prosecutor-General had already dealt with it and had been of the view that, notwithstanding the medical reports concerning the applicant, there were no new circumstances warranting his release. His lawyers had been informed of the Prosecutor-General’s decision of 22 October 1992 and had been advised that no further appeal was possible.\r\n18.   By letter of 9 November 1992 the applicant’s lawyer asked the Prosecutor-General to terminate the investigation. She recalled that it had commenced on 8 July 1992 and, after the expiry of the statutory period of two months, had been extended for another two months until 8 November 1992. Under Article 222 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a further extension could only be justified in \"exceptional\" cases, which condition had not been satisfied in the applicant’s case. Nor had the Prosecutor-General obtained any new evidence during the four months which had elapsed since the investigation had started.\r\nThe lawyer also contested the charges against the applicant. The decisions of the Council of Ministers had been taken collectively in accordance with the Constitution and the budget voted by the National Assembly. The decisions in question had been taken simply with a view to implementing policies of the government in power at the time and it was the government, not the applicant as a Deputy Prime Minister, which had administered the relevant funds. In any event, it had not been established that the applicant had committed the offences in issue for his own benefit or for that of a third party.\r\n19.   On 10 November 1992 the applicant’s lawyer lodged a request for his release with the Prosecutor-General, maintaining, inter alia, that the further prolongation of his detention breached Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention (art. 5-3) and that, contrary to Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c), no grounds had been given for his detention. The argument that the applicant had appealed against the order to withdraw his passport was unfounded as he had only exercised his rights under Bulgarian law. The lawyer refused to comment on the allegation that the applicant constituted a particular danger to society on account of his position as member of the National Assembly.\r\n20.   On 11 November 1992 the Prosecutor-General informed the applicant’s lawyer orally that his request of 10 November 1992 had been dismissed in the absence of any new circumstances justifying modification of the decision to detain him on remand.\r\n21.   In a letter of 18 November 1992 to the Prosecutor-General the applicant, referring to Article 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, complained about the prosecutor’s failure to reply to his requests in writing. He asserted that the criminal proceedings against him had no legal basis and amounted to an overt act of political reprisal.\r\n22.   In a letter of 20 November 1992 to the public prosecutor, the applicant’s lawyer queried the outcome of the request of 10 November 1992 (see paragraph 19 above), stating that the information was important for the application filed with the Commission.\r\nOn 25 November 1992 the public prosecutor replied that his decision of 11 November had been transmitted to the applicant’s lawyer on 16 November and that minutes relating to these measures had been prepared in accordance with Article 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\r\n23.   On 29 December 1992 the Bulgarian National Assembly reversed its decision of 7 July 1992 authorising the applicant’s detention on remand. On 30 December 1992 the prosecutor decided to release the applicant on bail.\r\n24.   On 12 March 1994 the Sofia City Court awarded the applicant compensation for non-pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the attempts made by the border police to withdraw his passport in the absence of a lawful order to this effect. The decision was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 9 February 1995.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\r\nA. The Bulgarian Criminal Code of April 1968, as in force at the relevant time\r\n25.   Under Article 201 of the Criminal Code, public servants who misappropriate public or private funds which are in their possession in their capacity as public servants or which they have been entrusted with to keep secure or administer are liable to up to eight years’ imprisonment. If a further offence has been committed in order to facilitate the misappropriation or if the offence has been committed with the complicity of others, between one and ten years’ imprisonment may be imposed (Article 202).\r\nWhere an offence under Articles 201 or 202 involves particularly large amounts of public funds and is serious, Article 203 para. 1 provides for terms of between ten and thirty years’ imprisonment.\r\n26.   As appears from a number of rulings by the Supreme Court (D 133-77-II, p. 80; D 63-79-I, p. 61; D 271-85-II, p. 87; D 172-88-I, bull. no. 12/88, p. 4; D 144-79-I, p. 73; D 315-75-II, p. 52; and D 5-83-Pl., p. 17) supplied by the applicant’s lawyer in consultation with the Agent of the Government before the Court’s hearing, at the material time a condition for the offence of misappropriation under Article 201 of the Criminal Code was that the person concerned had disposed of the means in question as though they were his or her own, in order to obtain an advantage for himself or herself or for a third party.\r\nIn a judgment of 1995 (no. 17/95) the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional an amendment by the National Assembly to make it an express condition in Article 201 that the person concerned had used the funds to his own advantage or that of a third party. In the opinion of the Constitutional Court, such a limitation on the scope of the offence of misappropriation would entail too weak a protection of the right to property guaranteed by the Constitution of 1991. It should be decisive for the offence, not that there had been personal enrichment, but that the person had disposed of the means as though they were his own and had thereby harmed the owner’s interests.\r\nIn connection with the above, the Constitutional Court stated that the amendment in question had been in line with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Article 201.\r\nAccording to the Government, there was no example at the relevant time of a member of a government having been prosecuted under Articles 201 and 203 of the Criminal Code for his or her participation in collective decision-making by the government.\r\n27.   Article 219 para. 1 provides:\r\n\"If a public servant, in his administration of assets or of money in his possession or in the execution of work which he has been ordered to do, negligently causes considerable material damage, or the destruction or dispersal of the assets, to the disadvantage of the service concerned or the national economy, he will be punished by a term of imprisonment of not more than three years or by forced labour in the public interest.\"\r\nAccording to paragraph 3, up to eight years’ imprisonment may be imposed if the offence is committed wilfully.\r\n28.   Article 282 provides:\r\n\"(1) A public servant who does not fulfil his professional obligations or who commits an abuse of power with the aim of obtaining a material advantage for himself or for a third party or of causing damage to others, and if not insignificant material damage could arise, shall be punished by a term of not more than five years’ imprisonment ...\r\n(2) If the act results in considerable material damage or has been committed by a person occupying a senior administrative post, the person concerned shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of eight years ...\r\n(3) If such an act is particularly serious the term of imprisonment shall be between three and ten years ...\"\r\nB. The Bulgarian Code of Criminal Procedure of November 1974, as in force at the material time\r\n29.   Under Article 147 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an accused may be placed under court supervision in order to ensure that he or she does not abscond or commit a new offence or to prevent collusion. The kind of measure imposed depends on the evidence against the accused, his or her state of health, family situation, profession and any other information concerning his or her character.\r\n30.   Article 152 provides, in so far as relevant:\r\n\"(1) Detention on remand shall be imposed if the charges concern crimes punishable by a term of imprisonment of ten years or more or by capital punishment.\r\n(2) The measure envisaged in the previous paragraph shall not be imposed if there is no danger of the accused evading justice or committing another crime.\r\n...\r\n(4) The detained person may immediately lodge an appeal with the court against his detention. The Court shall decide within three days by means of a decision which is final.\"\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n31.   In his application (no. 21915/93) to the Commission of 1 September 1992 the applicant complained that his arrest and detention on remand had been incompatible with Article 5 para. 1 (c) of the Convention (art. 5-1-c), in that there was no reasonable suspicion of his having committed a crime and that the measures were not necessary in order to prevent him from committing an offence or fleeing. He further complained that while remanded in custody he had suffered inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 (art. 3) and that, contrary to Article 6 (art. 6), he had not been afforded a public hearing before the Supreme Court. In addition, he complained that the criminal proceedings against him concerned acts which did not constitute a criminal offence at the material time and thus gave rise to a breach of Article 7 (art. 7). He alleged that there had been a breach of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) on account of an order by the public prosecutor prohibiting him from writing articles about matters related to the investigations. Finally, he contended that there had been a breach of Article 18 of the Convention (art. 18).\r\n32.   On 12 January 1995, the Commission declared the application admissible in so far as it concerned the applicant’s complaints under Articles 5 para. 1 and 18 of the Convention (art. 5-1, art. 18) and declared the remainder of his application inadmissible.\r\nIn its report of 16 January 1996 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1) and that no separate issue arose under Article 18 (art. 18). The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n33.   At the hearing on 28 November 1996, the Government, as they had done in their written observations to the Court, conceded that there had been violations of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1).\r\n34.   On the same occasion the lawyer for the applicant reiterated his request in his memorial to find that there had been violations of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and to award him just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION\r\n35.   The applicant was shot dead outside his home on 2 October 1996, while the case was pending before the Court (see paragraph 7 above). It has not been disputed that his widow and two children (see paragraph 5 above) were entitled to pursue the application on his behalf and the Court sees no reason to hold otherwise (see, for instance, the Ahmet Sadik v. Greece judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, p. 1652, para. 26).\r\nII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 1 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 5-1)\r\n36.   The applicant alleged that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), which, in so far as relevant, reads:\r\n\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\r\n...\r\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;\r\n...\"\r\n37.   The applicant, with whom the Commission agreed, was of the opinion that the facts which had been invoked against him at the time of his arrest and during his continued detention (see paragraphs 9, 11 and 13 above) could not, in the eyes of an objective observer, be construed as misappropriation of funds or as a breach of official duties aimed at facilitating the commission of such an offence. Accordingly, there had been no \"reasonable suspicion of [his] having committed an offence\" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c). Nor could the detention be \"reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so\".\r\nIn these circumstances, the Commission did not find it necessary to examine whether the detention was \"lawful\" under domestic law.\r\nThe applicant, for his part, stressed that the decisions leading to the charges against him and his being detained on remand had been taken collectively by the government at the time and in a manner which was consistent with the relevant law, including the then Bulgarian Constitution; the allocation of the funds in question had been effected in accordance with the national budget as adopted by the National Assembly and had subsequently been approved by the latter. The measures had been in keeping not only with the policies of the government at the time but also with relevant United Nations resolutions on development assistance. They had not benefited any members of the government or any third parties; the funds had been received in their entirety by the addressee countries.\r\n38.   The Government maintained before the Commission that the applicant’s detention had been effected on the grounds of suspicion of his having committed a crime and had been in conformity with Bulgarian law. Although it was true that the allocation of development aid had not as such constituted a criminal offence, the charges in question had been brought because the transfers of funds had, under the cover of development assistance, involved improper \"deals\" causing damage to Bulgaria’s economic interests. The Government were, however, not in a position to provide any details of such \"deals\" as it would adversely affect the confidentiality of the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant and eight other former government members.\r\nBefore the Court the Government stated that they were prepared to accept the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1), whilst at the same time informing the Court of the views of the Prosecutor-General, the authority which had ordered the applicant’s detention on remand (see paragraph 11 above). In this regard the Government pointed out that it was not within their competence to assess the measures taken in this case by the prosecution and the Supreme Court which, under the Constitution, were both independent judicial authorities.\r\n39.   The Prosecutor-General’s submission on the applicant’s complaints included the following observations.\r\nIt was a key element of the offence of misappropriation under Bulgarian law that the offender had dealt with someone else’s property as though it had been his or her own and had thereby infringed the owner’s interests; it was not decisive whether he or she had sought to obtain an advantage for himself or herself or for a third party (see paragraph 26 above). Furthermore, members of a body could by reason of their joint decisions and actions be found guilty if they had thereby knowingly committed acts which amounted to an offence. In the present case, since the collective decisions concerned had caused economic loss, criminal proceedings had been instituted against each member of the body which had taken those decisions (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). The prosecutor had believed that the funds concerned had been spent in a manner which was unlawful since there was no information as to whether they had appeared in the budget as an expenditure.\r\nAdmittedly, the Prosecutor-General had not been in a position at the time to ascertain whether there was criminal intent. He had considered, having regard to the circumstances and complexity of the case, that this could only be determined in the course of the preliminary investigations.\r\nAlthough not expressly stated in the order to detain the applicant on remand, the decision had been taken in view of who the applicant was and the gravity of the offence committed (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above). The Supreme Court too had laid stress on the applicant’s status as a member of the National Assembly (see paragraph 13 above). The extremely wide powers which he had enjoyed by virtue of his position had given him greater opportunities to abscond or commit further offences than he would have had otherwise. Furthermore, his position in society, his numerous contacts abroad and his repeated requests that the authorities return his passport, were all considerations which went to justify placing him in pre-trial detention. As stated by the Supreme Court, the fact that the applicant had appealed against the withdrawal of his passport had given rise to a justified suspicion that he might commit a further offence, within the meaning of Article 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 13 above).\r\nIn the view of the Prosecutor-General, the contested pre-trial detention was in accordance with domestic law, including the Bulgarian Constitution, and had been entirely in keeping with Article 5 para. 1 (c) of the Convention (art. 5-1-c).\r\n40.   The Court observes at the outset that it has jurisdiction to examine the facts and circumstances of the applicant’s complaints in so far as they related to the period after 7 September 1992, when Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. In doing so, it will take into account the state of the proceedings as of that date (see, for instance, the Hokkanen v. Finland judgment of 23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, p. 19, para. 53; and the Yagci and Sargin v. Turkey judgment of 8 June 1995, Series A no. 319-A, p. 16, para. 40), in particular the fact that the grounds for his detention, stated in the detention order of 9 July and the Supreme Court judgment of 13 July upholding the order, remained the same until his release on 30 December 1992 (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above). This has not been disputed before the Court.\r\nAs to the observations made by the Government concerning the independence of the authorities which had taken the measures giving rise to the applicant’s Convention complaints (see paragraph 38 above), it should be emphasised that the Governments are answerable under the Convention for the acts of such authorities as they are for those of any other State agency. In all cases before the Court, what is in issue is the international responsibility of the State (see, mutatis mutandis, the Foti and Others v. Italy judgment of 10 December 1982, Series A no. 56, p. 21, para. 63). Notwithstanding the Government’s acceptance of the Commission’s opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), the Court considers it appropriate to examine this question for itself.\r\n41.   Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1) contains an exhaustive list of permissible grounds for deprivation of liberty which must be interpreted strictly (see, for instance, the Ciulla v. Italy judgment of 22 February 1989, Series A no. 148, p. 18, para. 41).\r\nThe Court is of the view that the central issue in the case under consideration is whether the applicant’s detention from 7 September to 30 December 1992 was \"lawful\" within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), including whether it was effected \"in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\". The Court reiterates that the Convention here refers essentially to national law, but it also requires that any measure depriving the individual of his liberty be compatible with the purpose of Article 5 (art. 5), namely to protect the individual from arbitrariness (see, for instance, the Bozano v. France judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 23, para. 54; and the Benham v. the United Kingdom judgment of 10 June 1996, Reports 1996-III, pp. 752-53, para. 40).\r\nWhere the Convention refers directly back to domestic law, as in Article 5 (art. 5), compliance with such law is an integral part of the obligations of the Contracting States and the Court is accordingly competent to satisfy itself of such compliance where relevant (Article 19) (art. 19); the scope of its task in this connection, however, is subject to limits inherent in the logic of the European system of protection, since it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Bozano judgment, p. 25, para. 58; and the Kemmache v. France (no. 3) judgment of 24 November 1994, Series A no. 296-C, p. 88, para. 42).\r\n42.   Turning to the particular circumstances of the case, the Court observes that it is undisputed that the applicant had, as a member of the Bulgarian Government, taken part in the decisions - granting funds in assistance and loans to certain developing countries - which had given rise to the charges against him.\r\n43.   However, none of the provisions of the Criminal Code relied on to justify the detention - Articles 201 to 203, 219 and 282 (see paragraphs 11 and 13 above) - specified or even implied that anyone could incur criminal liability by taking part in collective decisions of this nature. Moreover, no evidence has been adduced to show that such decisions were unlawful, that is to say contrary to Bulgaria’s Constitution or legislation, or more specifically that the decisions were taken in excess of powers or were contrary to the law on the national budget.\r\nIn the light of the above, the Court is not persuaded that the conduct for which the applicant was prosecuted constituted a criminal offence under Bulgarian law at the relevant time.\r\n44.   What is more, the public prosecutor’s order of detention of 9 July 1992 and the Supreme Court’s decision of 13 July upholding the order referred to Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 13 and 25 above). As appears from the case-law supplied to the Court, a constituent element of the offence of misappropriation under Articles 201 to 203 of the Criminal Code was that the offender had sought to obtain for himself or herself or for a third party an advantage (see paragraph 26 above). The order of 9 July in addition referred to Article 282 which specifically makes it an offence for a public servant to abuse his or her power in order to obtain such advantage (see paragraphs 9 and 28 above).\r\nHowever, the Court has not been provided with any fact or information capable of showing that the applicant was at the time reasonably suspected of having sought to obtain for himself or a third party an advantage from his participation in the allocation of funds in question (see, for instance, the Murray v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 October 1994, Series A no. 300-A, p. 25, para. 51). In this connection it is to be noted that the Government’s submission that there had been certain \"deals\" was found by the Commission to be unsubstantiated and was not reiterated before the Court. Indeed, it was not contended before the Convention institutions that the funds had not been received by the States concerned.\r\n45.   In these circumstances, the Court does not find that the deprivation of the applicant’s liberty during the period under consideration was \"lawful detention\" effected \"on reasonable suspicion of [his] having committed an offence\".\r\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Court does not need to examine whether the detention could reasonably be considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so.\r\n46.   Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in the present case.\r\nIII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 18 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 18)\r\n47.   Before the Commission, the applicant alleged that there had also been a violation of Article 18 of the Convention (art. 18), which reads:\r\n\"The restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.\"\r\n48.   The Commission, having regard to its findings with respect to Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1) (see paragraph 37 above), concluded that no separate issue arose under Article 18 (art. 18). On this point too the applicant agreed with the Commission.\r\n49.   The Court, bearing in mind its conclusions with regard to Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1), likewise considers that no separate issue arises under Article 18 (art. 18).\r\nIV.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50)\r\n50.   In his memorial to the Court, Mr Andrei Lukanov sought just satisfaction under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50), which reads:\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\r\nA. Non-pecuniary damage\r\n51.   The applicant claimed no compensation for pecuniary damage but asked the Court to award him compensation for the moral and physical injury which he had suffered as a result of the detention.\r\n52.   The Government left the matter to the discretion of the Court, whereas the Commission’s Delegate suggested that the Court make an award of 115,000 French francs (FRF), on the basis that a compensation of FRF 1,000 for each of the 115 days during which the applicant had been unlawfully detained would be adequate.\r\n53.   The Court considers that sufficient just satisfaction would not be provided solely by the finding of a violation and that compensation has thus to be awarded. Making an assessment on an equitable basis, it awards FRF 40,000, to be converted into Bulgarian leva at the rate applicable on the date of settlement, to his widow and two children, who are pursuing his application on his behalf.\r\nB. Costs and expenses\r\n54.   The applicant further requested the reimbursement of costs and expenses, in an amount in Bulgarian leva corresponding to the totals of 13,456 US dollars (USD) and FRF 7,067, which were incurred in respect of the following items:\r\n(a) USD 3,100 for his lawyer Mrs Loultcheva’s work in connection with the case before the Commission;\r\n(b) USD 3,272 and FRF 1,600 for his own and his lawyer’s travel and subsistence expenses in connection with the hearing before the Commission;\r\n(c) USD 2,000 for his lawyer’s work in connection with the case before the Court;\r\n(d) USD 1,800 for Mr Entchev’s work in connection with translation and interpretation in the proceedings before the Court;\r\n(e) USD 3,284 and FRF 5,467 for Mrs Loultcheva’s and Mr Entchev’s travel and subsistence expenses in connection with their appearance at the Court’s hearing.\r\n55.   The Government left it to the Court’s discretion to make an award for costs and expenses. The Commission’s Delegate considered the claims under items (a) to (c) to be reasonable and that an amount would also have to be awarded with respect to such costs and expenses as mentioned in items (d) and (e).\r\n56.   The Court is satisfied that the costs and expenses claimed were actually and necessarily incurred in the stated currencies and were reasonable as to their quantum. In accordance with its case-law it awards to the applicant’s widow and his two children the entirety of the claim made under this head.\r\nC. Default interest\r\n57.   The Court considers it appropriate that default interest should be payable at the rate of 4% per annum with regard to the sums awarded in French francs and 5% per annum with respect to the sum awarded in US dollars.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.   Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 5-1);\r\n\r\n2.   Holds that no separate issue arises under Article 18 of the Convention (art. 18);\r\n\r\n3.   Holds\r\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant’s widow and two children within three months the following sums, to be converted into Bulgarian leva at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:\r\n(i) 40,000 (forty thousand) French francs, in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, and\r\n(ii) for legal costs and expenses, 13,456 (thirteen thousand, four hundred and fifty-six) US dollars and 7,067 (seven thousand and sixty-seven) French francs;\r\n(b) that simple interest at the following annual rates shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement:\r\n(i) 4% per annum in relation to the sums awarded in French francs, and\r\n(ii) 5% per annum in relation to the sum awarded in US dollars;\r\n\r\n4.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 20 March 1997.\r\n\r\nRolv RYSSDAL\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\n",

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 23389/94)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n21 February 1996 \r\n \r\n\r\nIn the case of Singh v. the United Kingdom ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\nMr \tR. Ryssdal, President,\r\nMr \tF. Gölcüklü,\r\nMr \tR. Macdonald,\r\nMr \tA. Spielmann,\r\nMr \tN. Valticos,\r\nMrs\tE. Palm,\r\nMr \tF. Bigi,\r\nSir \tJohn Freeland,\r\nMr \tP. Jambrek,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 September 1995 and 26 January 1996, Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date :\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court on 8 December 1994 by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") and on 23 December 1994 by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\"the Government\"), within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 23389/94) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 25 January 1994 by a British citizen, Mr Prem Singh.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the case of Hussain v. the United Kingdom (no. 55/1994/502/584) should be heard by the same Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6) and that a joint hearing should be held. The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 27 January 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Gölcüklü, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr N. Valticos, Mrs E. Palm, Mr F. Bigi and Mr P. Jambrek (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 13 April 1995 and the applicant’s memorial on 3 May. The Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\r\n5.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 September 1995. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government\r\n\tMr I. CHRISTIE, \r\n\tForeign and Commonwealth Office,\tAgent,\r\n\tMr D. PANNICK QC, Mr M. SHAW, Barrister-at-Law, \tCounsel,\r\n\tMr H. CARTER,\r\n\tMr H. BAYNE,\r\n\tMr R. HARRINGTON, Home Office,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\tMr N. BRATZA, \tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\n\tMr E. FITZGERALD QC,\r\n\tMr J. COOPER, Barrister-at-Law,\tCounsel,\r\n\tMr R. KING,\tSolicitor.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Pannick.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n6.   Mr Prem Singh was born in 1957 and is currently resident in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.\r\n7.    On 19 February 1973, the applicant - then aged 15 - was convicted at Leeds Crown Court of the murder of a 72-year-old woman. He had broken into her home, strangled her, cut her throat and had sexual intercourse with her at around the time of her death. Mr Singh received a mandatory sentence of detention \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" pursuant to section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) (see paragraph 29 below). Its effect was to render the applicant \"liable to be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the Secretary of State [for the Home Department] may direct\".\r\n8.    In October 1990, having served the punitive part of his sentence (\"tariff\" - see paragraph 33 below), Mr Singh was released on licence.\r\n9.    On 11 March 1991 the applicant was arrested and interviewed at Southmead police station, Bristol, in connection with a number of alleged offences involving deception, and one of using threatening behaviour. He denied the allegations.\r\n10.    On 12 March 1991 the Parole Board considered Mr Singh’s case, and on 21 March 1991 his life licence was revoked by the Secretary of State on its recommendation. On 21 March 1991 the applicant received a formal notice of the reasons for this decision, which he was entitled to by virtue of section 62 (3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (see paragraph 43 below). It informed him that the Secretary of State had revoked his licence in the light of:\r\n\"(i) Reports indicating that you had lied to and misledyour supervising officers and avoided telling them of avariety of significant events following your release onlicence.\r\n(ii) Your arrest and subsequent appearances beforeBristol Magistrates on several criminal charges includingfraud and using threatening behaviour, set against thecircumstances surrounding the offence for which you weregiven a life sentence in 1973, make it impossible for theSecretary of State to be satisfied that your continuedpresence in the community did not constitute a risk tothe public.\"\r\n11.   On 27 August 1991, having complained to the Avon Probation Service about its recommendation, Mr Singh received a more detailed explanation of his recall in a letter from the chief probation officer. The reason given for his recall was not the alleged offences (which were a matter for the court), but rather his failure to provide accurate information about his circumstances to his supervising probation officer. The letter cited specifically his failure to inform her about the purchase of a motor vehicle; getting a job and giving false information to his employers about his age and character; having a relationship and not telling his girlfriend all about his background; and falling into arrears with his rent.\r\n12.   Mr Singh denied the accuracy of most of these allegations, and asked the Parole Board to review the merits of the revocation of his licence. Under section 62 (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (now section 39 (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 - see paragraph 43 below), the Parole Board was empowered at this stage to take a binding decision for Mr Singh’s immediate release.\r\n13.   The Parole Board considered the applicant’s case on 27 August and 19 December 1991. It had before it a number of reports from the probation service and the police, none of which was disclosed to the applicant. On 19 December 1991 the Board decided against recommending Mr Singh’s immediate release. He was not told the reasons for this decision.\r\n14.   On 2 March 1992 the criminal charges against Mr Singh (see paragraph 9 above) were dismissed because the prosecution had presented the indictment out of time. Mr Singh asked for his case to be reconsidered in the light of this development, and the Secretary of State accordingly referred it back to the Parole Board, under the procedure set out in section 61 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (see paragraph 34 below). On 30 July 1992 the Board again declined to recommend Mr Singh’s release.\r\n15.   The applicant then sought judicial review (see paragraph 47 below) of the two decisions of the Parole Board of 19 December 1991 and 30 July 1992. On 20 April 1993 the Divisional Court quashed the Parole Board’s decision of 19 December 1991 on the ground that there had been a breach of natural justice because of the Board’s failure to disclose to Mr Singh all the reports before it. The court held that the applicant was entitled to a fresh consideration by the Parole Board under the terms of section 39 (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, at which the Board would be empowered to order (not merely to recommend) his release (see paragraph 43 below). Lord Justice Evans found, inter alia, that:\r\n\"[Mr Singh’s] status is that of a person whose continueddetention can only be justified if the test ofdangerousness, meaning an unacceptable risk of physicaldanger to the life or limb of the public, is satisfied\"(R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, exparte Prem Singh, unreported, transcript pp. 26F-27B) He further commented that the disclosed facts \"scarcely seem able to support a positive answer to [this question]\".\r\n16.   As a result of the Divisional Court’s decision, Mr Singh received a complete file of the documents which were before the Parole Board. This included a number of detailed probation reports alleging deception of his supervising officers by Mr Singh, and also several hundred pages of witness statements obtained by the police in connection with the criminal charges which had been dismissed (see paragraphs 9 and 14 above).\r\n17.   With the help of his solicitor, Mr Singh made written representations to the Parole Board. He denied the allegations contained in the letter from the chief probation officer that he had deceived his supervising probation officer (see paragraph 11 above) and supported his case with witness statements from his girlfriend and landlady.\r\n18.   On 18 June 1993 the Parole Board considered Mr Singh’s case. He was not permitted to be present at the review and had no opportunity to give oral evidence or to question those who had made allegations against him. The Board decided not to recommend release, and gave the following reasons:\r\n\"The Panel accepted that Mr Singh’s representationsanswered some matters which were of concern to hisprobation officer. However, there was a lack of opennessin his dealings with the Probation Service. The Panelalso considered that the conduct which led to thecriminal charges indicated a serious kind ofdeceptiveness. His behaviour under supervision led thePanel to conclude that the nature of his personality andbehaviour had not changed significantly since theoriginal offence at the age of 15. His failure to complywith the discipline of licence supervision, bearing inmind the original offence, gives rise to considerableconcern.\"\r\n19.   Mr Singh applied for judicial review of this decision, but he withdrew his application on or about 7 March 1994 because he had been offered an early review of his case by the Parole Board.\r\n20.   In June 1994 the Parole Board reconsidered Mr Singh’s case in accordance with section 35 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (see paragraph 35 below). Mr Singh entered detailed representations and the file before the Board was disclosed to him; it contained recent reports from probation officers, from a psychologist working with Mr Singh and from the Local Review Committee (see paragraph 46 below). All the reports which made a specific recommendation were in favour of the applicant’s release as soon as possible via a pre-release hostel.\r\n21.   As the applicant was informed on 21 July 1994 the Parole Board unanimously recommended his release subject to six months in a pre-release employment scheme. The reasons given were as follows:\r\n\"On the evidence presented to [the panel], theyconsidered Prem Singh no longer constituted a danger tolife or limb of committing further life threateningoffences to justify his continued detention since hisrecall in March 1991.\"\r\n22.   The applicant was also informed on 21 July 1994 that the Secretary of State was \"not prepared to accept this recommendation and [did not agree] to [the applicant’s] release\". The Secretary of State so decided in exercise of his statutory powers (see paragraph 43 below).\r\n23.   By a communication of 8 September 1994 the applicant was given the reasons for the Secretary of State’s decision. These were that Mr Singh had misled the probation service after his release in October 1990 and had appeared before the magistrates on several criminal charges, although these had subsequently been dismissed on technical grounds. Thus, he had been recalled to prison \"following serious breaches of the trust placed in [him] as a life licensee\". The Secretary of State was unable to assess accurately whether he was still a threat to the public, because he had spent the three and a quarter years since his recall in a closed prison. He considered that Mr Singh’s relationship with the probation service needed to be tested in the \"more challenging environment of an open prison\". For these reasons, he believed that Mr Singh should be transferred to an open prison for further testing. His next formal review by the Parole Board would begin in October 1995.\r\n24.   Mr Singh applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s decision. On 16 March 1995 the Divisional Court quashed the Secretary of State’s decision and ordered him to reconsider it. The court found, inter alia, that the correct test to be applied was whether Mr Singh constituted a danger to the \"life or limb\" of the public, and that the reasoning process of the Secretary of State had been flawed because he had not properly explained how the findings he had made related to the test of dangerousness (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (no. 2), unreported).\r\n25.   In September 1995 Mr Singh joined a pre-release employment scheme. His provisional date for release is 18 March 1996.\r\n\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\nA. Categorisation of detention in the case of murderers\r\n26.   A person who unlawfully kills another with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm is guilty of murder. English law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder: \"detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" if the offender is under the age of 18 (section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) - see paragraph 29 below); \"custody for life\" if the offender is between 18 and 20 years old (section 8 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982); and \"life imprisonment\" for an offender aged 21 or over (section 1 (1) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965). Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law in contrast to discretionary life sentences, which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences (for example manslaughter, rape, robbery).\r\nThe principles underlying the passing of a discretionary life sentence are: \r\n(i) that the offence is grave and\r\n(ii) that there are exceptional circumstances whichdemonstrate that the offender is a danger to the publicand that it is not possible to say when that danger willsubside. Discretionary life sentences are indeterminate so that\r\n\"the prisoner’s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody only so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large\" (R. v. Wilkinson [1983] 5 Criminal Appeal Reports 105, 108).\r\nB. Detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure\r\n27.   The notion of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has its origins in statutory form in an Act of 1800 for \"the safe custody of insane persons charged with offences\" (Criminal Lunatics Act), which provided that defendants acquitted of a charge of murder, treason or felony on the grounds of insanity at the time of the offence were to be detained in \"strict custody until His Majesty’s pleasure shall be known\" and described their custody as being \"during His [Majesty’s] pleasure\".\r\n28.   In 1908, detention during His Majesty’s pleasure was introduced in respect of offenders aged between 10 and 16. It was extended to cover those under the age of 18 at the time of conviction (1933) and further extended to cover persons under the age of 18 at the time when the offence was committed (1948).\r\n29.   The provision in force at present is section 53 (1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended) (\"the 1933 Act\") which provides:\r\n\"A person convicted of an offence who appears to thecourt to have been under the age of eighteen years at thetime the offence was committed shall not, if he isconvicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment forlife, nor shall sentence of death be pronounced on orrecorded against any such person; but in lieu thereof thecourt shall ... sentence him to be detained during HerMajesty’s pleasure and, if so sentenced he shall beliable to be detained in such a place and under suchconditions as the Secretary of State may direct.\"\r\n30.   In the case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (20 April 1993, cited above at paragraph 15) Lord Justice Evans in the Divisional Court held as follows in respect of detention \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\":\r\n\"At the time of sentencing, the detention orders under section 53 were mandatory. It is indeed the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder. But the sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary sentence of which part is punitive (retribution and deterrence) and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety when the test of dangerousness is satisfied. The fact that the mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its period: see R. v. Secretary of State Ex. p. Doody & Others [1993] Q.B. 157 and Wynne v. UK (E.C.H.R. 1st December 1992). The order for detention under section 53 is by its terms both discretionary and indeterminate: it provides for detention ‘during Her Majesty’s pleasure’ I would decide the present case on the narrow ground that, notwithstanding Home Office and Parole Board practice, the applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether Wilson rather than Payne governs his case.\"\r\n(transcript, pp. 24C-25B)\r\nThe court accordingly held that the applicant should be afforded the same opportunity as would be given to a discretionary life prisoner to see the material before the Parole Board when it decided whether he should be released after his recall to prison on revocation of his licence. The Parole Board has changed its policy accordingly.\r\n31.   However, in a statement in Parliament made on 27 July 1993 (see paragraph 38 below), the Secretary of State, Mr Michael Howard, explained that he included in the category of \"mandatory life sentence prisoners\" those\r\n\"persons who are, or will be, detained during HerMajesty’s pleasure under section 53 (1) of the Childrenand Young Persons Act 1933 ...\"\r\n32.   In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte T. and Others [1994] Queen’s Bench 378, 390D, Lord Justice Kennedy in the Divisional Court (with whom Mr Justice Pill agreed) said:\r\n\"I see no reason to regard him as having any specialstatus because he was sentenced to detention [during HerMajesty’s pleasure] rather than to life imprisonment,despite what was said by Evans LJ when giving judgment inReg. v. Parole Board, ex parte Singh (Prem)(20 April 1993, unreported). The issues in that casewere very different from those with which we areconcerned. If Hickey had not been sent to hospital hecould hope to benefit from the provisions ofsection 35 (2) of the 1991 Act [on mandatory lifeprisoners] ... It will be recalled that in Hickey’s casethe offence was murder, so the sentence was mandatory notdiscretionary.\"\r\nOn appeal the Court of Appeal stated that in respect of a person sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure under section 53 (1) of the 1933 Act for the offence of murder, the relevant provisions on release were those in section 35 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (see paragraph 35 below), and not those relating to a discretionary life prisoner (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hickey [1995] 1 All England Law Reports 479, 488).\r\nC. Release on licence\r\n33.   Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment, custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure have a \"tariff\" set in relation to that period of imprisonment they should serve to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. After the expiry of the tariff, the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence. Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change in recent years, in particular following the coming into force on 1 October 1992 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (\"the 1991 Act\").\r\n\r\n1. General procedure\r\n34.   Section 61 (1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 (\"the 1967 Act\") provided, inter alia, that the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge, may \"release on licence a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for life or custody for life or a person detained under section 53 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933\". In this respect no difference was made between discretionary and mandatory life prisoners.\r\n35.   By virtue of section 35 (2) of the 1991 Act, persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure and those life prisoners who are not discretionary life prisoners (see paragraph 26 above), may be released on licence by the Secretary of State, if recommended to do so by the Parole Board and after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge. The decision on whether to release still lies, therefore, with the Secretary of State.\r\n36.   The Secretary of State also decides the length of a prisoner’s tariff. Subsequently to a House of Lords judgment of 24 June 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 Appeal Cases 531, 567G), the view of the trial judge is made known to the prisoner after his trial as is the opinion of the Lord Chief Justice. The prisoner is afforded the opportunity to make representations to the Secretary of State who then proceeds to fix the tariff. Where the Secretary of State decides to depart from the judicial recommendation he is obliged to give reasons. As a matter of practice the prisoner is informed of the Secretary of State’s final decision. In the second, post-punitive phase of detention the prisoner knows that \"the penal consequence of his crime has been exhausted\" (ibid., 557A).\r\n37.   A statement of policy issued by Sir Leon Brittan, then Secretary of State for the Home Department, on 13 November 1983 indicated that release on licence following expiry of the tariff depended on whether the person was considered no longer to pose a risk to the public.\r\n38.   On 27 July 1993, the Secretary of State, Mr Michael Howard, made a statement of policy in relation to mandatory life prisoners, stating, inter alia, that before any such prisoner is released on licence he\r\n\"will consider not only, (a) whether the period served bythe prisoner is adequate to satisfy the requirements ofretribution and deterrence and, (b) whether it is safe torelease the prisoner, but also (c) the publicacceptability of early release. This means that I willonly exercise my discretion to release if I am satisfiedthat to do so will not threaten the maintenance of publicconfidence in the system of criminal justice\".\r\n39.   In a number of recent court cases involving persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure, it has been stated that the correct test for post-tariff detention was to be whether the offender continued to constitute a danger to the public (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Cox, 3 September 1991; R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh, 20 April 1993 - cited above at paragraph 15; R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (no. 2), 16 March 1995).\r\n2. rocedure applicable to discretionary life prisoners\r\n40.   The 1991 Act instituted changes to the regime applying to the release of discretionary life prisoners following the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A).\r\n41.   Pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 Act, the tariff of a discretionary life prisoner is now fixed in open court by the trial judge after conviction. After the tariff has expired, the prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board which has the power to order his release if it is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined.\r\nPursuant to the Parole Board Rules 1992 which came into force on 1 October 1992, a prisoner is entitled to an oral hearing, to disclosure of all evidence before the panel (see paragraph 45 below) and to legal representation. There is provision enabling a prisoner to apply to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross-examine those who have written reports about him.\r\n42.   For the purposes of the 1991 Act, persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure are not regarded as discretionary life prisoners (section 43 (2)).\r\nD. Revocation of licences\r\n43.   Recall to prison of a person released on licence was governed by section 62 of the 1967 Act which reads:\r\n\"(1) Where the Parole Board recommends the recall of anyperson who is subject to a licence under section 60 or 61of this Act, the Secretary of State may revoke thatperson’s licence and recall him to prison.\r\n(2) The Secretary of State may revoke the licence of anysuch person and recall him as aforesaid withoutconsulting the Board, where it appears to him that it isexpedient in the public interest to recall that personbefore such consultation is practicable.\r\n(3) A person recalled to prison under the foregoingprovisions of this section may make representations ...\r\n(4) The Secretary of State shall refer to the Board thecase of a person recalled under subsection (1) of thissection who makes representations under the lastforegoing subsection and shall in any event so refer thecase of a person returned to prison after being recalledunder subsection (2) of this section.\r\n(5) Where the Board recommends the immediate release onlicence of a person whose case is referred to it underthis section, the Secretary of State shall give effect tothe recommendation...\"\r\n44.   Section 39 of the 1991 Act has added that a person recalled to prison shall be informed of the reasons for his recall and of his right to make representations in writing.\r\nE. Parole Board and Local Review Committees\r\n45.   Section 59 of the 1967 Act set out the constitution and functions of the Parole Board:\r\n\"(1) For the purposes of exercising the functionconferred on it by this Part of this Act as respectsEngland and Wales there shall be a body known as theParole Board ... consisting of a chairman and not lessthan four other members appointed by the Secretary ofState.\r\n...\r\n(4) The following provisions shall have effect withrespect to the proceedings of the Board on any casereferred to it, that is to say\r\n(a) the Board shall deal with the case on   consideration of any documents given to it by the   Secretary of State and of any reports it has called   for and any information whether oral or in writing   that it has obtained; and\r\n(b) if in any particular case the Board thinks it   is necessary to interview the persons to whom the   case relates before reaching a decision, the Board   may request one of its members to interview him and   shall take into account the report of that   interview by that member ...\r\n(5) The documents to be given by the Secretary of Stateto the Board under the last foregoing subsection shallinclude\r\n(a) where the case referred to the Board is one of   release under section 60 or 61 of this Act, any   written representations made by the person to whom   the case relates in connection with or since his last interview in accordance with rules under the next following subsection;\r\n(b) where the case so referred relates to a person recalled under section 62 of this Act, any written representations made under that section.\"\r\nAs to the constitution of the Parole Board, Schedule 2 to the 1967 Act further provides:\r\n\"1. The Parole Board shall include among its members\r\n(a) a person who holds or has held judicial office;\r\n(b) a registered medical practitioner who is a   psychiatrist;\r\n(c) a person appearing to the Secretary of State to have knowledge and experience of the supervision or after care of discharged prisoners;\r\n(d) a person appearing to the Secretary of State to have made a study of the causes of delinquency or the treatment of offenders.\"\r\nThe Parole Board always counts among its members three High Court judges, three circuit judges and a recorder. Cases referred to the Board may be dealt with by three or more members of the Board (Parole Board Rules 1967). In practice, the Board sits in small panels, including, in the case of life prisoners, a High Court judge and a psychiatrist. The judges on the Board are appointed by the Home Secretary (section 59 (1) of the 1967 Act) after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice.\r\nWith the exception of the new rules concerning discretionary life prisoners, similar provisions apply under the 1991 Act.\r\n46.   Under section 59 (6) of the 1967 Act the Secretary of State established for every prison a Local Review Committee with the function of advising him on the suitability for release on licence of prisoners. It was the practice to obtain this assessment before referring a case to the Parole Board. Before the Local Review Committee reviewed a case, a member of the committee would interview the prisoner if he was willing to be interviewed.\r\nThe first review by the Local Review Committee was normally fixed to take place three years before the expiry of the tariff. Local Review Committees were abolished by the Parole Board Rules 1992. The prisoner is now interviewed by a member of the Parole Board.\r\nF. Judicial review\r\n47.   Persons serving a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure may institute proceedings in the High Court to obtain judicial review of any decision of the Parole Board or of the Secretary of State if those decisions are taken in breach of the relevant statutory requirements or if they are otherwise tainted by illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety (Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service, [1984] 3 All England Law Reports 935, 950-51).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n48.   Mr Singh applied to the Commission on 25 January 1994. He relied on Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention, complaining that he should be entitled to have the lawfulness of his continued detention determined by a court and that the Parole Board in its powers and procedures failed to offer the requisite safeguards.\r\n49.   The Commission declared the application (no. 23389/94) admissible on 30 June 1994. In its report of 11 October 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention. The full text of the Commission’s opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS MADE TO THE COURT\r\n50.   At the hearing, the Agent of the Government invited the Court to conclude that, in the present case, there had been no breach of the Convention. The applicant, for his part, asked the Court to uphold his complaints and declare that his rights under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) had been violated, both by the denial of a review by a court-like body and by the denial at any time of an oral hearing at which he could have put his case for release in person.\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   SCOPE OF THE CASE\r\n51.   In his memorial to the Court and at the hearing the applicant complained of the secretive and unfair manner in which his tariff (see paragraph 33 above) had been established.\r\n52.   The Court notes that this particular complaint was not dealt with by the Commission in its report or admissibility decision and that, as pointed out by the Delegate of the Commission, it is uncertain whether it can be regarded as falling within the compass of the case before the Court as delimited by the Commission’s decision on admissibility (see, inter alia, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 13, para. 29). In any event, given the fact that the applicant’s punitive period has now expired, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint. The scope of the case before the Court is therefore confined to the issues under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) raised in connection with the applicant’s current situation, that is post-tariff detention.\r\n\r\nII.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 4 (art. 5-4) OF THECONVENTION\r\n53.   Mr Singh complained that he had not been able either on his recall to prison in 1991 or at reasonable intervals thereafter to have the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure (see paragraph 26 above) heard by a court. He invoked Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention which provides:\r\n\"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest ordetention shall be entitled to take proceedings by whichthe lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedilyby a court and his release ordered if the detention isnot lawful.\"\r\n54.   The Court will first examine whether, having regard to the particular features of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) are satisfied by the original trial and appeal proceedings or, on the contrary, whether that provision confers an additional right to challenge the lawfulness of the continued detention before a court.\r\nA. Whether the requisite judicial control was   incorporated in the original conviction\r\n55.   In the applicant’s submission, a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure differed from the mandatory life sentence imposed on adults (see paragraph 26 above), which the Court examined in its Wynne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 July 1994 (Series A no. 294-A), in that the former is not solely based on the gravity of the offence but takes into account the age of the offender. The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes. In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive.\r\nIn support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 27 and 29 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose. He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (\"a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life\" - see paragraph 29 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (\"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\").\r\nIn view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence. As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76). This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence. It follows that at that phase in the execution of his sentence, the applicant was entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention and of any re-detention determined by a court at reasonable intervals.\r\n56.   The Commission agreed in substance with the applicant’s submissions and added that the absence of the word \"life\" in the sentence reinforced its indeterminate character.\r\n57.   The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness. This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above). Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 38 above).\r\nIt was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults. In these circumstances, the issues in the present case were practically identical to those in the Wynne case (cited above at paragraph 55) where the Court found that the original trial and appeal proceedings satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.\r\n58.   The Court notes at the outset that, as has been commonly accepted, the central issue in the present case is whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment. In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 40) or to that in the more recent Wynne case (cited at paragraph 55).\r\n59.   It is true, as submitted by the Government, that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is mandatory: it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion. It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).\r\nOn the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression \"during Her Majesty’s pleasure\" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word \"life\" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence.\r\n60.   Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\r\n61.   It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence. In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence. However, an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public.\r\nThese considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older. A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.\r\n62.   Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence. This was, albeit in a different context, the view expressed by the Divisional Court in its judgment of 20 April 1993 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh - see paragraphs 15 and 30 above).\r\nThe decisive ground for the applicant’s continued detention was and continues to be his dangerousness to society, as the Divisional Court restated on 16 March 1995 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (no. 2) - see paragraph 24 above), a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time. Accordingly, new issues of lawfulness may arise in the course of detention and the applicant is entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to take proceedings to have these issues decided by a court at reasonable intervals as well as to have the lawfulness of any re-detention determined by a court (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 76).\r\nB. Whether the available remedies satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4)\r\n63.   The Government accepted that if, contrary to their submissions, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) did confer additional rights to challenge the lawfulness of the applicant’s continued detention, there would have been a breach of that provision but only to the extent that the Parole Board had no general power to order the release of the applicant after the expiry of his tariff.\r\nIn reply to the applicant’s submission that the importance and the nature of the issue, that is the detainee’s mental state, called for an oral hearing, including the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses, the Government recalled that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not confer an absolute right to an adversarial procedure and that to the extent that fairness did require an oral hearing, this could be secured by bringing judicial review proceedings.\r\n64.   The Commission found that the Parole Board’s lack of decision-making power meant that it could not be regarded as a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4). As to the need for an oral hearing, the Delegate of the Commission added that judicial review \"is a very uncertain remedy given the fact that express provision is made for an oral hearing in the case of discretionary life prisoners, but not in the case of persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure\".\r\n65.   The Court recalls that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not guarantee a right to judicial control of such scope as to empower the \"court\" on all aspects of the case, including questions of expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority; the review should, nevertheless, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which, according to the Convention, are essential for the lawful detention of a person subject to the special type of deprivation of liberty ordered against the applicant (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Weeks judgment, p. 29, para. 59, the E. v. Norway judgment of 29 August 1990, Series A no. 181-A, p. 21, para. 50, and the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 79).\r\n66.   As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4). Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government. However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).\r\n67.   The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing (see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow v. Austria judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-B, p. 45, para. 67).\r\n68. The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.\r\n69.   It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review. In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about. In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.\r\nC. Recapitulation\r\n70.   In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that the applicant, after the expiry of his tariff, was unable to bring before a court with the powers and procedural guarantees satisfying that provision (art. 5-4) the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure or of his re-detention following the revocation of his licence.\r\nIII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n71.   Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention provides as follows:\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken bya legal authority or any other authority of a HighContracting Party is completely or partially in conflictwith the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partialreparation to be made for the consequences of thisdecision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, ifnecessary, afford just satisfaction to the injuredparty.\"\r\nThe applicant’s claims under this provision (art. 50) were for compensation for non-pecuniary damage and reimbursement of legal costs and expenses referable to the proceedings before the Convention institutions.\r\nA. Damage\r\n72.   The applicant adopted the terms of the claim for compensation in the case of Hussain v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 272, para. 65) and, additionally, sought compensation for the \"material and moral damages\" caused by the Parole Board’s failure to recommend his release in the 1991 and 1993 proceedings and by the Secretary of State’s denial of the Parole Board’s recommendation for release in July 1994. He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000.\r\n73.   The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994. On the basis of the evidence before it, however, it cannot speculate as to what the applicant’s conduct would have been and whether he would have been eventually released. As to the moral damage allegedly suffered, the Court shares the Government’s view that, in the circumstances, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50).\r\nB. Costs and expenses\r\n74.   For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax.\r\n75.   The Government found the sum claimed excessive.\r\n76.   In the light of the criteria emerging from its case-law, the Court holds that the applicant should be awarded the amount of £13,000 less 15,421 French francs already paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees and travel and subsistence expenses.\r\nC. Default interest\r\n77.   According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the United Kingdom at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 8% per annum.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\r\n1.   Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that theapplicant, after the expiry of his punitive period, wasunable to bring before a court the case of his continueddetention or of his re-detention following the revocationof his licence;\r\n\r\n2.   Holds that the present judgment constitutes in itselfsufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damagesustained;\r\n\r\n3.   Holds \r\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay to the applicant,within three months, in respect of legal costs andexpenses, £13,000 (thirteen thousand pounds sterling),less 15,421 (fifteen thousand four hundred andtwenty-one) French francs already paid by way of legalaid, to be converted into pounds sterling at the rate ofexchange applicable on the date of delivery of thepresent judgment; \r\n(b) that simple interest at an annual rate of 8% shall bepayable from the expiry of the above-mentioned threemonths until settlement;\r\n\r\n4.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for justsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 February 1996.\r\n\r\nROLV RYSSDAL\r\n\t\t\tPresident\r\n\r\nHERBERT PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\n\r\n",

THE NETHERLANDS\r\n\r\n(Applications nos. 21363/93, 21364/93, 21427/93 and 22056/93)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n23 April 1997 \r\n \r\nIn the case of Van Mechelen and Others v. the Netherlands ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court B , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr\tR. BERNHARDT, President,\r\n\tMr\tF. MATSCHER,\r\n\tMr\tC. RUSSO,\r\n\tMr\tN. VALTICOS,\r\n\tMr\tI. FOIGHEL,\r\n\tMr\tB. REPIK,\r\n\tMr\tK. JUNGWIERT,\r\n\tMr\tE. LEVITS,\r\n\tMr\tP. VAN DIJK,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 27 January and 18 March 1997,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 17 April 1996, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in four applications (nos. 21363/93, 21364/93, 21427/93 and 22056/93) against the Kingdom of the Netherlands lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by Mr Hendrik van Mechelen and Mr Willem Venerius on 27 November 1992, by Mr Johan Venerius on 8 December 1992 and by Mr Antonius Amandus Pruijmboom on 24 November 1992. All four applicants are Netherlands nationals.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Netherlands recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d).\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 35 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court B, the applicants designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 31).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr S.K. Martens, the elected judge of Netherlands nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 27 April 1996, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr F. Matscher, Mr C. Russo, Mr N. Valticos, Mr I. Foighel, Mr B. Repik, Mr K. Jungwiert and Mr E. Levits (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr P. van Dijk, the newly elected judge of Netherlands nationality, replaced Mr Martens who had resigned (Rules 6 and 21 para. 3 (a)).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Netherlands Government (\"the Government\"), the applicants’ lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 39 para. 1 and 40). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s memorial on 14 October 1996 and the applicants’ memorials and Article 50 claims (art. 50) between 22 and 29 October.\r\n5.   On 30 September 1996 the President of the Chamber rejected an application by Rights International, a non-governmental organisation based in New York, for leave to submit written comments (Rule 39 para. 2).\r\n6.   On 10 January 1997 a document which the Registrar had sought from the Government at the request of the President of the Chamber was received at the registry.\r\n7.   On 22 January 1997 the President of the Chamber decided to admit to the case file certain additional documents submitted by the applicants.\r\n8.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 January 1997. he Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government\r\n\t\tMr R.A.A. BÖCKER, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\r\n\t\tMr H.A.M. VON HEBEL, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\tAgents,\r\n\t\tMs I.M. ABELS, Ministry of Justice,\r\n\t\tMs N.H.N.I. HOUBEN, Ministry of Justice,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr H.G. SCHERMERS,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicants\r\n\t\tMr G.G.J. KNOOPS, advocaat en procureur,\r\n\t\tMr J.M. SJÖCRONA, advocaat en procureur,\r\n\t\tMs T. SPRONKEN, advocaat en procureur,\tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMs M. GARÉ,\r\n\t\tMs S. VAN DER TOORN,\tAssistants.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Schermers, Mr Knoops, Mr Sjöcrona, Ms Spronken and Mr von Hebel.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\nA. Background to the case\r\n9.   The police received information to the effect that the applicants were the perpetrators of several robberies, and that they operated from two residential caravan sites. It was decided to detail a police observation team (observatieteam, \"OT\") to keep these caravan sites under observation as from 25 January 1989.\r\n10.   On 26 January 1989 at around 5.15 p.m. three motor cars, a Mercedes estate car, a BMW and a Lancia, were seen to leave one of the two caravan sites shortly after each other. Their registration numbers were noted.\r\n11.   On 26 January 1989 at around 6 p.m. the post office of the town of Oirschot was robbed. The window of the post office was broken down by backing a Mercedes estate car equipped with a steel girder into it. One of the robbers, wearing a black balaclava helmet and armed with a pistol, forced the staff to surrender some 70,000 Netherlands guilders. The robbers then set the Mercedes car alight and made off in a BMW.\r\nPolice cars alerted by radio followed the BMW. Police officers saw the BMW drive onto a sand track leading into a nearby forest. Later they saw a column of smoke coming out of the forest. The BMW was subsequently found there, burnt out.\r\nFour police officers in a police car saw a red car (later found to be a Lancia) leave the forest via the same sand track used by the BMW and gave chase. In the course of the chase the boot of the car was opened from the inside and men squatting in the back opened fire at the pursuing police car with a pistol and a sub-machine gun. A car containing civilians was hit by a stray bullet but its occupants were not hurt.\r\nThe Lancia made off at high speed and entered a side road. When the police car caught up with it the Lancia was stationary. A man standing in the road fired at the police car with a sub-machine gun. The police car was hit and its occupants injured, after which the gunman and the persons in the Lancia made their escape.\r\n12.   All three cars - the Mercedes, the BMW and the Lancia - were later identified as the cars which had been seen leaving the caravan site (see paragraph 10 above).\r\nB. The criminal proceedings\r\n1. Proceedings in the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Regional Court\r\n13.   The applicants and one other man, called Amandus Pruijmboom (not to be confused with the applicant Antonius Amandus Pruijmboom), were charged with attempted murder - or, in the alternative, attempted manslaughter - and robbery with the threat of violence and summoned to appear for trial before the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) on 19 May 1989.\r\nEvidence proffered by the prosecution included statements made to a named police officer by police officers identified only by a number.\r\n14.   In interlocutory judgments of 2 June 1989 the Regional Court decided that it was necessary to establish whether the police officers identified only by numbers had investigative competence (opsporingsbevoegdheid). To that end it referred the case to the investigating judge (rechter-commissaris) and adjourned the case until 20 July.\r\nThe investigating judge established that the police officers in question did in fact have investigative competence.\r\nCounsel for Mr Willem Venerius argued, inter alia, that the police officers identified only by a number were anonymous witnesses, so that their statements did not constitute sufficient proof, in the absence of corroborating evidence, to support a conviction. The Regional Court rejected this argument, holding that since the police officers in question had investigative competence, the evidential value of their statements was not affected by their anonymity.\r\nThe Regional Court convicted the accused of attempted manslaughter and robbery with the threat of violence. The evidence identifying the applicants as perpetrators of these crimes was constituted by the statements made before the trial by the anonymous police officers, none of whom gave evidence before either the Regional Court or the investigating judge.\r\nAll five accused were sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.\r\n2. Proceedings in the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal\r\n15.   The five convicted men appealed to the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal (gerechtshof).\r\nAt the hearing before that court on 2 May 1990 the applicants’ lawyers made requests for several named and anonymous witnesses to be heard. The Court of Appeal thereupon referred the case to the investigating judge, firstly because it considered it necessary to find out what objections the police officers themselves had against the lifting of their anonymity and secondly because the number of persons to be heard was such that it could not conveniently be done in open court. The persons to be heard were four named police officers, eleven anonymous police officers (identified to the defence and the court only by a number) and two civilians.\r\n16.   The named and anonymous witnesses were questioned on 24 and 27 September and on 5-8 and 13 November 1990.\r\nAll of the anonymous witnesses were - or had at the relevant time been - police officers invested with investigative competence.\r\nThe procedure followed for questioning them was that the investigating judge, the witness and a registrar were together in one room, and the defendants, their lawyers and the advocate-general in another. The defendants, the lawyers and the advocate-general could hear all the questions asked to the witnesses and their replies through a sound link. The statements of the witnesses were repeated by the investigating judge to the registrar, who took them down.\r\n17.   On 24 September 1990 witness 001 was interrogated. He was a member of an observation team. It was his wish and that of his superiors that he remain anonymous in the interests of the service; in addition, his family had been threatened in the past. Witness 001 confirmed a statement which he had made earlier, to the effect that when confronted with Mr van Mechelen through a two-way mirror he had identified him as the man who had sat next to the driver of the Lancia.\r\nWitness BRZ03 was interrogated the same day. His wish to remain anonymous was primarily inspired by the wish to ensure the safety of his family and friends; he had been threatened in the past. At the time of the crimes in question he had been a member of an arresting team. He had been a passenger in the front seat of the police car used to pursue the Lancia and had been badly wounded in the shooting.\r\nWitness 006 was a member of an observation team. He wished to remain anonymous to ensure the safety of his family and friends and his colleagues; he knew of cases in which a police officer’s family had been threatened. He confirmed the correctness of a report which he had drawn up together with witness 005.\r\nWitness BRZ09 had been a member of an arresting team at the relevant time. He wished to remain anonymous in the interests of the service but also for the safety of his family. He confirmed an earlier report to the effect that he had been a back-seat passenger in the police car which had pursued the Lancia, and had been fired at.\r\n18.   On 27 September 1990 the investigating judge drew up an official report of his findings with regard to the first four anonymous witnesses. He considered them all reliable, although they had shown great caution when asked questions which might affect their anonymity. He also considered their reasons for wishing to remain anonymous well-founded.\r\n19.   Also on 27 September 1990 the investigating judge interrogated, in addition to two named police officers, the named witness Mr Engelen. Mr Engelen was a civilian bystander who stated that he had seen a man fire a gun. He had later identified Mr van Mechelen as that man when confronted with him through a two-way mirror.\r\n20.   On 3 October 1990 the Court of Appeal resumed the hearing. The lawyer defending Mr Willem Venerius asked for one anonymous police officer - BRZ03 - to be heard in open court. The Court of Appeal however decided not to continue its own examination of the case until all witnesses had been questioned by the investigating judge.\r\n21.   On 5 November the investigating judge resumed the interrogation of the witnesses.\r\nWitness BRZ10 stated that he was a member of an arresting team. He had been the driver of the police car used in the attempt to pursue the Lancia and force it to stop. He had recognised Mr Johan Venerius as the driver of the Lancia.\r\nWitness 004 stated that he had been a member of an observation team at the relevant time. He wished to remain anonymous because he feared for the safety of his family. In addition, he was involved in the work of the criminal intelligence department (Criminele Inlichtingen Dienst, \"CID\"). His superiors wanted him to remain anonymous for that reason. He too had recognised Mr Johan Venerius as the driver of the Lancia.\r\nWitness 005 was also a member of an observation team. He had been a passenger in a police car which had passed the Lancia and had recognised Mr Johan Venerius as the driver.\r\n22.   Witness 003 had been a member of an observation team at the relevant time. He wished to remain anonymous in the interests of the service as well as for the safety of his family. He had been the driver of an unmarked police car and had seen the BMW and the Lancia drive past but had not recognised any of their occupants.\r\nWitness 46204 had been a member of an arresting unit. He wished to remain anonymous in the interests of the service as well as for the safety of his family. He had seen the BMW both before and after the robbery in Oirschot. The driver on both occasions had been the applicant Pruijmboom, whom he had later recognised at a confrontation.\r\nWitness 46203 had been a member of the same arresting unit. He was \"99% certain\" that he had seen Mr van Mechelen enter the caravan site about an hour before the three cars left from there.\r\nWitness BRZ08 had left the police force but at the relevant time had been a member of an arresting team. He wished to remain anonymous for the safety of his family, three of his colleagues having been threatened in the past. He had been the driver of the police car which had pursued the Lancia and had been fired at. He had sustained injuries, as had the other police officers in the car.\r\n23.   The various named police officers provided background information relating to the investigation and the procedures followed but did not positively identify any of the applicants as the perpetrators. Some of them stated that they knew of colleagues who had been threatened in other cases but none of them had yet been threatened in this case.\r\n24.   On 19 November 1990 the investigating judge drew up a report of his findings concerning the questioning of the witnesses. This document reads as follows:\r\n\"REGIONAL COURT OF ‘s-HERTOGENBOSCH\r\nInvestigating judge\r\nwith responsibility\r\nfor criminal cases\r\n_________________\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL RECORD OF FINDINGS\r\nThe cases against:\r\nWillem Venerius,\r\nJohan Venerius,\r\nHendrik van Mechelen,\r\nAmandus Pruijmboom, and\r\nAntonius Amandus Pruijmboom\r\nwere referred by the Court of Appeal at ‘s-Hertogenbosch to myself, A.H.L. Roosmale Nepveu, investigating judge with responsibility for criminal cases at the Regional Court of ‘s-Hertogenbosch. I, investigating judge, wish to place the following on record in connection with the investigation conducted by myself with the assistance of the registrar.\r\nThe Court of Appeal referred the cases against the said accused persons to me in order for a total of twenty-one witnesses to be heard. Eleven of them are designated only by a number in the documents.\r\nI, investigating judge, questioned twenty witnesses in the presence of the registrar. I also, together with the registrar, drew up a record of the hearing for each accused separately. The statements of the witnesses are however similar in all cases, since the hearings took place simultaneously in all five cases.\r\nThus in the statements the names of fellow accused and their counsel appear as ‘persons asking questions’.\r\nThe witnesses indicated were questioned on the dates given below:\r\n24 September 1990\t001\r\n\t\t\tBRZ03\r\n\t\t\t006\r\n\t\t\tBRZ09\r\n27 September 1990\tF.P.W.

Meijers\r\n\t\t\tP.F.M. Aarts\r\n\t\t\tH.P.C. Koene (resumed)\r\n13 November 1990\tH.B. Corbijn\r\n\t\t\tP.J.M. Swartjes\r\n\t\t\tG.W.A.M. Ligtvoet.\r\n...\r\nThe accused, their counsel and the advocate-general were always invited to the hearings. Whenever they appeared they were also given an opportunity to ask questions. They did so extensively. The hearings took up a great deal of time. The shortest hearing of an unidentified witness lasted nearly two hours (46203); the longest about five hours (BRZ08). The hearings of witnesses Jansen and Koene each lasted a good five hours. This information may perhaps be of use in assessing the suggestion that was made on 3 October 1990 to the Court of Appeal, that all the witnesses should be heard by the Court in a single day.\r\nWhere a witness did not answer a question, this is also indicated in the text of his statement.\r\nThe statements were recorded in very great detail and in fact cover all the matters raised - also by the defence -, in a factual and where necessary even literal transcript. Once the text existed in draft form, those present were invariably given the opportunity to make comments, request clarification and put further questions. Where necessary the statement was then amended, clarified and expanded - always, of course, within the limits of what the witness really wanted to say. And even if ... there are drawbacks to the manner in which the hearings of the unidentified witnesses were carried out, it is my belief that the advocate-general and the defence had sufficient opportunity to question the witnesses thoroughly at the hearings. Those present really did have the opportunity for hours on each occasion. If they so desired, those present had several chances to put questions to a witness. Unlike what normally happens at court hearings, everyone was able to follow the entire transcription of the statements and then still obtain clarifications and additions. Questions were barred only on substantive grounds (see the records for details), not by reason of the time taken for the interrogations.\r\nIn the light of recent case-law in the matter of statements by unidentified witnesses, I think it is right for me to make known my findings regarding the statements of the unidentified witnesses heard in this case. I, the investigating judge, and the registrar, are the only persons who attended all the hearings from start to finish.\r\nI stand by my official record of findings dated 27 September 1990 where the witnesses referred to in it are concerned [see paragraph 18 above]. I would now add the following:\r\nAll the ‘numbered witnesses’ made their identities known to me. It was clear to me that all eleven were different persons.\r\nTheir statements indicated such a knowledge of the facts that I am entirely convinced that I was talking to the witnesses referred to by numbers in the documents. I have no reason to doubt their reliability. Nor at any time did I have the impression that I was being lied to. On the contrary, each and every one of them was very much to the point. The persons facing me wore serious expressions. The unidentified witnesses were clearly quite aware of the serious nature of the oath or pledge they had given and of the very great interests at stake, especially for the accused persons involved. The calm, quiet manner in which, for example, BRZ03 and BRZ08 related their experiences in Leende (in which connection I expressly leave it to the Court of Appeal to decide whether these accused persons were the perpetrators) was impressive and certainly gave no indication of malice towards the accused. All the witnesses manifested a certain degree of wariness, which, in view of their desire to remain anonymous and the sometimes rather forceful manner of questioning on the part of [two of the defence lawyers] in particular, did not bother me.\r\nIf all the statements are laid side by side, some differences of detail can be observed. I do not think that these differences are such as to warrant the conclusion that the witnesses may be unreliable. Rather, in so far as I have observed any differences, I would describe them rather as the ‘extraneous noise’ which in my experience practically always affects statements by witnesses. Of course it is ultimately for the Court of Appeal to decide on the value of the statements.\r\nThe reasons for the witnesses wishing to remain anonymous in the instant case are given in the records of the hearings. It seems to me that I am now affording the Court an opportunity to reflect on the value of those arguments. I think that the text of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands also compels me, as the judge conducting the questioning, to state my opinion on the reasons given by the witnesses for remaining anonymous. I am also concerned to inform the Court of Appeal that I am aware that the Court is called to take the final decision in these matters. I consider the reasons behind the desire to remain anonymous to be such as fully to justify anonymity. I have had regard in this connection to the nature of these cases and to the nature of the activities of the anonymous witnesses concerned.\r\nI take the liberty of observing - while expressly leaving aside the question whether these accused persons are the perpetrators - that the instant case tellingly illustrates the fact that there are evidently people for whom human lives do not count when it comes to evading responsibility for exceptionally serious crimes which they may have committed.\r\nI can understand that there are major objections to revealing the names and appearance of members of arresting teams, observation teams and arresting units to the public at large. By that I mean that the obvious interest of society in having very serious crimes solved should weigh in the balance. At the same time, I am of the opinion that the conduct of the unidentified witnesses (who are no longer anonymous to myself) who have appeared in this case is the subject of proper judicial supervision. It is not apparent to me as investigating judge that the ‘numbered witnesses’ acted carelessly. Rather, in my opinion, the opposite was true.\r\nDuring the last hearing of the witness Koene, [two of the defence lawyers] asked me to record that, in their view, the witness answered not only the questions of the defence but also questions by the investigating judge in a ponderous, deliberate manner that was hard to follow. I have been asked to endorse that opinion. I decline to do so. The witness Koene was wary in his answers, which I find understandable in view of the barrage of questions - which were not always formulated equally clearly. It must not be forgotten that a witness who is being questioned on oath about a multitude of events that occurred some years previously should not be reproached for failing, in his answers to those questions, to keep up with the tempo of the rather forceful questioning to which [the two lawyers] in particular subjected him on 8 November 1990, together and in tandem. Furthermore, I can imagine that a witness may be somewhat annoyed if he is repeatedly asked the same question, especially if he has already replied under oath on the day before. The witness Koene kept a cool head, and in so doing demonstrated a certain quality. As far as I can judge at the present time, I regard him as a reliable witness. Nor do I think that he can be regarded as a reluctant witness, if only by reason of his extensive statements in the records of 7 November and 8 November 1990.\r\nThe witness Koene informed me on 15 November 1990 that on 26 January 1989 the persons numbered BRZ05 and BRZ14 were in the car with BRZ10. He gave me this information following a request by the defence.\r\nI think I ought not to omit to mention, with regard to the witness Engelen, that throughout the hours of insistent questioning he certainly did not strike me as untruthful. In my judgment, Mr Engelen is a simple, friendly and very obliging man. Perhaps I can illustrate the impression I had of him by recording that, after the interrogation had gone on for a considerable time, I thought it opportune to ask the unusual question whether the witness could read. I do not exclude the possibility that he is not entirely aware of the great importance of an exact and consistent account of what he saw.\r\nIn the second paragraph on the first page of the statement by the witness Engelen, I suggested to him that the confrontation had occurred on 15 February 1989. The date should be 9 March 1989. [One of the defence lawyers] pointed this out to me later and I think he is right.\r\n...\r\n(signed) A.H.L. Roosmale Nepveu\r\n19 November 1990\"\r\n25.   The hearing before the Court of Appeal was resumed on 16, 17 and 18 January 1991.\r\nOn 16 January a named witness, Mr Engelen, was heard in open court. He had stated to the police in March 1989, and to the investigating judge in September 1990, that he recognised the applicant Van Mechelen as the man who had fired a sub-machine gun at a police car in the village of Leende. Before the Court of Appeal he stated that on the latter occasion he had been allowed to re-read his earlier statement, but that he was no longer sure whether he could still recognise either the weapon or the man who had fired it. He also said that he had not been threatened in connection with the case.\r\nOn 18 January the lawyer acting for the applicant Van Mechelen brought forward two persons chosen for their excellent eyesight (both having participated in the Olympic games as members of the Netherlands rifle-shooting team), and who had participated in a reconstruction of the shooting in light and weather conditions similar to those obtaining at the time of the crime. These witnesses both stated that they had been unable to distinguish the features of the persons acting the parts of the perpetrators at the distances at which it had been alleged that the accused had been seen by Mr Engelen. A video recording had been made of the reconstruction, in the presence of a notary who had kept the original videotape under seal.\r\nThe hearing was again resumed on 21 January 1991, and the video of the reconstruction was shown.\r\n26.   The Court of Appeal convicted all four applicants in four separate but similar judgments on 4 February 1991.\r\nAll four applicants were found guilty of attempted murder and robbery with the threat of violence and sentenced to fourteen years’ imprisonment. The fifth suspect, Mr Amandus Pruijmboom, was acquitted.\r\nThe Court of Appeal’s judgment in the case of the applicant Van Mechelen contained the following:\r\n\"Considering with regard to the statements, used in evidence, of the persons who remained anonymous, that these statements were taken down by a judge, more particularly the investigating judge responsible for criminal cases within the jurisdiction of the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Regional Court, who himself knows the identity of the witnesses, who has heard these witnesses on oath, who in his official record of his findings ... has given his reasoned opinion of the reliability of the witnesses and their reasons for wishing to remain anonymous, and who, moreover, has offered the accused and the defence the opportunity to question these witnesses, of which opportunity, as appears from the official records of the interrogations, extensive use has been made.\r\nThe objections of the witnesses heard by the investigating judge and identified only by a number to remain anonymous (sic) are sufficient reason for the Court of Appeal to continue this anonymity. The Court of Appeal refuses the request made by counsel at the hearing to have these witnesses heard in open court, even if this request should be understood to imply that the witnesses might be disguised, since the possibility that the witnesses may be recognised in open court cannot be excluded.\r\nOf the arguments for continuing the anonymity of the witnesses, the Court of Appeal considers particularly persuasive the personal safety of these witnesses and their families, and it makes no difference that these witnesses have not yet been threatened. As already noted in the Court of Appeal’s interlocutory decision of 3 October 1990, the present case concerns extremely serious crimes, the [attempted murder] having been committed so as to evade recognition and arrest by the police, the perpetrators having been prepared to sacrifice a number of human lives. In these circumstances, the risk run by the witnesses identified only by a number and their families if their anonymity is lifted or insufficiently guaranteed is decisive. In so far as anonymous witnesses have refused to answer questions this was done in order not to disclose methods of investigation or to maintain the anonymity of other investigating officers involved in the case.\"\r\nThe Court of Appeal considered the statements of the anonymous police officers to be corroborated by each other and by the evidence available from non-anonymous sources. This other evidence included a transcript of a telephone conversation between the wife of Mr Johan Venerius and her mother intercepted two days after the date of the crime, from which it appeared that Mr Johan Venerius had not returned home in the meanwhile and his whereabouts were unknown, as well as forensic reports relating to the cars and the weapons used for the crime and the above-mentioned statements of the named civilians and police officers. However, the Court of Appeal did not rely on the statements of Mr Engelen.\r\n3. Proceedings in the Supreme Court\r\n27.   The applicants filed appeals on points of law (cassatie) to the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad).\r\nIn accordance with the advisory opinion of the advocate-general, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals in a series of judgments of 9 June 1992. It held that in the circumstances the evidence given by the unnamed police officers was admissible, since on the one hand their evidence was sufficiently corroborated by the evidence obtained from named sources and on the other the procedure followed provided sufficient compensation for the handicaps under which the defence had laboured.\r\nThe Supreme Court’s judgments concerning Mr Willem Venerius and Mr van Mechelen were reported in Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (Netherlands Law Reports, \"NJ\") 1992, nos. 772 and 773 respectively.\r\n28.   It has not been alleged that any named or anonymous witnesses were at any time threatened by or on behalf of the applicants.\r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\n29.   Except for the differences noted below (see paragraphs 39 and following), relevant domestic law and practice at the time of the criminal proceedings complained of were as set out in the Court’s Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989 (Series A no. 166). Reference is therefore made to that judgment, especially pp. 13-17, paras. 22-32.\r\nA. The Code of Criminal Procedure\r\n1. Evidence in general\r\n30.   The finding that an accused has committed the act with which he is charged must be based on \"legal means of evidence\" (wettige bewijsmiddelen - Article 338 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering - CCP)).\r\n\"Legal means of evidence\" include inter alia statements of witnesses relating to facts or circumstances which they themselves have witnessed (Articles 339 para. 1 (3) and 342 para. 1 CCP) and written documents (Article 339 para. 1 (5) and 344 para. 1 CCP).\r\nSuch evidence must normally be corroborated by other evidence (Articles 342 para. 2, 344 para. 1 (5) CCP). However, an official record made in the proper form by a police officer invested with investigative competence can be admitted without corroboration (Article 344 para. 2 CCP).\r\n2. Witnesses\r\n31.   The public prosecutor has the power to call witnesses and experts to the hearing (Article 260 CCP). In his summons to the accused he gives a list of the witnesses and experts to be brought forward by the prosecution. If the accused wishes to call witnesses, he can - according to Article 263 - submit a request to the public prosecutor no later than three days before the court hearing to summon a witness before the court. As a rule, the public prosecutor should summon the witness, but - according to Article 263 para. 4 - he may refuse to do so if it is to be reasonably assumed that no prejudice to the rights of the defence will be caused if the witness is not heard in open court (\"Indien redelijkerwijs moet worden aangenomen, dat de verdachte niet in zijn verdediging kan worden geschaad wanneer een door hem opgegeven getuige ... niet ter terechtzitting wordt gehoord\"). He has to give a reasoned decision in writing and must at the same time inform the defence of its right under Article 280 para. 3 (see paragraph 33 below) to renew the request to the trial court at the hearing.\r\n32.   At the opening of the trial hearing the prosecutor hands to the court a list of all the witnesses called, which is then read out by the registrar (griffier) (Article 280 para. 2).\r\n33.   If the public prosecutor has failed to summon a witness at the request of the accused, or declined to do so, the defence may ask the court to have that witness summoned (Article 280 para. 3). The court so orders, unless it finds that the non-appearance of this witness cannot reasonably be considered prejudicial to the rights of the defence (\"De rechtbank beveelt dat de ... getuige ... zal worden gedagvaard of schriftelijk opgeroepen, tenzij zij ... van oordeel is dat door het achterwege blijven daarvan de verdachte redelijkerwijs niet in zijn verdediging kan worden geschaad\" - Article 280 para. 4).\r\n34.   A request by the defence to hear a witness who has not been placed on the list of witnesses, who has not been convened to attend the trial and whose summons the defence has not sought in accordance with Article 280 falls under Article 315 CCP (see paragraph 35 below). It appears from the judgment of 23 December 1986 by the Supreme Court that the trial court needs only accede to a request of this nature if it finds it necessary to do so.\r\n35.   Under Article 315 CCP the trial court has the power to order of its own accord the production of evidence, including the summoning of witnesses whom it has not yet heard.\r\n36.   If it finds that there is occasion to do so, the trial court may order that a witness be brought to its hearing by the police (Articles 282 para. 1 and 315 CCP).\r\n37.   If at the trial the trial court finds it necessary to have any factual question examined by the investigating judge, it must suspend the hearing and refer the question to the investigating judge along with the case file. The investigation carried out by the investigating judge in these cases is deemed to be a preliminary judicial investigation and is subject to the same rules (Article 316 CCP).\r\n38.   Appeal proceedings against the conviction or sentence at first instance involve a complete rehearing of the case. Both the prosecution and the defence may ask for witnesses already heard at first instance to be heard again; they may also produce new evidence and request the hearing of witnesses not heard at first instance (Article 414 CCP). The defence enjoys the same rights as it does at first instance (Article 415 CCP).\r\nB. Case-law relating to anonymous witnesses\r\n39.   In its judgment of 9 January 1990, NJ 1990, no. 409, the Supreme Court held that there was no general rule in Netherlands law to the effect that statements by anonymous police officers could only be admitted if the trial court had first established the existence of clear indications that the officers were under threat.\r\n40.   In its judgment of 2 July 1990, NJ 1990, no. 692, the Supreme Court considered that it had to be assumed in light of the European Court’s Kostovski judgment that the use of statements by anonymous witnesses was subject to stricter requirements than those defined in its case-law until then. It defined these stricter requirements in the following rule: such a statement must have been taken down by a judge who (a) is aware of the identity of the witness, and (b) has expressed, in the official record of the hearing of such a witness, his reasoned opinion as to the reliability of the witness and as to the reasons for the wish of the witness to remain anonymous, and (c) has provided the defence with some opportunity to put questions or have questions put to the witness. On the other hand, according to the same judgment, a written document containing the statement of an anonymous witness may be used in evidence if (a) the defence has not at any stage of the proceedings asked to be allowed to question the witness concerned, and (b) the conviction is based to a significant extent on other evidence not derived from anonymous sources, and (c) the trial court makes it clear that it has made use of the statement of the anonymous witness with caution and circumspection.\r\nC. Law reform\r\n41.   The Act of 11 November 1993, Staatsblad (Official Gazette) 1993, no. 603, has added to the CCP a number of detailed provisions relating to the \"protection of witnesses\". It entered into force on 1 February 1994. The additions include the following.\r\nArticle 226a now provides that the identity of a witness may remain secret if there is reason to believe that the disclosure of his identity may threaten his life, health, safety, family life or socio-economic existence and if the witness has made it clear that he does not wish to make any statement because of this. The decision is made by the investigating judge, who must first hear the prosecution, the defence and the witness himself.\r\nAn appeal against the decision of the investigating judge lies to the trial court (Article 226b).\r\nThe investigating judge may order that a threatened witness be heard in the absence of the accused, or of counsel, or of both, so as not to disclose the identity of the threatened witness; in that event, the prosecuting authorities may not attend the questioning of the witness either. The investigating judge must then allow the defence to put questions of its own to the witness, either through the use of telecommunication or in writing (Article 226d).\r\nArticle 264 now lays down that the prosecution may refuse to summon a threatened witness.\r\nIf the trial court has ordered that a witness be heard and that witness turns out to be under threat, he must be heard in camera by the investigating judge (Article 280 para. 5).\r\nThe statement of an anonymous witness taken in accordance with the above-mentioned provisions may only be used in evidence against a person accused of crimes in respect of which his detention on remand is permitted (Article 342 para. 2 (b)).\r\nA new paragraph has been added to Article 344 to the effect that a written document containing a statement of a person whose identity is not apparent may only be used in evidence if the conviction is based to a significant degree on other evidence and if the defence has not at any time during the trial sought to question that person or have him questioned.\r\n42.   The following passages are taken from the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993:\r\n\"The Bill is based on the assumption that only threatened witnesses should be in a position to claim complete anonymity. I realise that the usefulness of certain police officers (e.g. undercover agents posing as drugs purchasers, members of an arresting team or an observation team) will be reduced thereby. However, the public interest in investigating serious crime cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity. This interest can in my opinion be sufficiently protected if the law creates the possibility to refrain from asking the police officer for certain identifying information and by granting the interrogating judge the power to take all measures which are reasonably required to prevent the disclosure of such identifying information, such as making the police officer unrecognisable by the use of make-up or disguise or preventing eye contact between the accused and the police officer.\" (Explanatory Memorandum, Lower House of Parliament 1991-92, 22 483, no. 3, p. 17).\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n43.   Mr van Mechelen and Mr Willem Venerius applied to the Commission on 27 November 1992, Mr Johan Venerius on 8 December and Mr Pruijmboom on 24 November. They relied on Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d), complaining that their convictions were based to a decisive extent on the evidence of anonymous witnesses, in respect of whom the rights of the defence had been unacceptably restricted.\r\n44.   The Commission declared the applications (nos. 21363/93, 21364/93, 21427/93 and 22056/93) admissible on 15 May 1995. In its report of 27 February 1996 (Article 31) (art. 31) it expressed the opinion that there had been no violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (twenty votes to eight). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the two dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT\r\n45.   The Government concluded their memorial by expressing the opinion that the applicants had had a \"fair trial\" within the meaning of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d).\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARAS. 1 AND 3 (d) OF THE CONVENTION (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d)\r\n46.   The applicants complained that their conviction had been based essentially on the evidence of police officers whose identity was not disclosed to them and who were not heard either in public or in their presence. They alleged a violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d), according to which:\r\n\"1. In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.\r\n...\r\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\r\n...\r\n(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him;\r\n...\"\r\nNeither the Government nor the Commission shared this view.\r\nA. Arguments before the Court\r\n47.   The applicants questioned the need to maintain the anonymity of the police officers at all. There had in their contention not been any danger for them or their families. This was borne out by the fact that Mr Engelen, the one named witness who in the earlier stages of the proceedings had made statements incriminating one of the applicants, had not been granted anonymity and it had not been suggested that he had at any time been threatened.\r\nMoreover, the interrogation of the witnesses should in their contention not have taken place before the investigating judge. It would in their view have been feasible to have the police officers questioned in open court, wearing disguise if need be.\r\nIn addition, the applicants considered that they had not had sufficient opportunity to challenge and question the police officers. They drew attention to the conditions under which the interrogation of the anonymous witnesses had taken place.\r\nThe anonymous police officers had been confined in a room with the investigating judge, separated from the applicants and their lawyers; it had not been possible for the applicants or their lawyers to discover whether there had been any other person in that room or what was going on there.\r\nNot all the questions asked by the defence had been answered. Questions not answered had included, for instance, where the police officer being interrogated had been at the time he made his observation, whether he wore spectacles, and whether the observation of the caravan sites had involved the use of optical aids or a directional microphone.\r\nFinally, the applicants claimed that their conviction had been based \"to a decisive extent\" on the evidence given by anonymous witnesses. The only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal positively identifying the applicants had been that given by anonymous police officers.\r\n48.   The Government and the Commission both considered that there had been no violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d).\r\nThey both considered that the safety of the police officers themselves and their families, and the need not to impair their usefulness in other similar operations, provided sufficient justification for maintaining their anonymity.\r\nThe procedure followed had been that established by the Netherlands Supreme Court in its judgment of 2 July 1990 (see paragraph 40 above) in the wake of the European Court’s judgment in the Kostovski case (judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166). This procedure, so they argued, had been accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment (Doorson v. the Netherlands, 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II).\r\nIn accordance with this procedure, the statements of the anonymous police officers had been taken down (a) by a judge, who (b) had himself ascertained the identity of the police officers concerned, (c) had given a written opinion of their reliability and credibility in his official report, (d) had given a reasoned opinion of their reasons to remain anonymous and found them sufficient, and (e) had given the defence sufficient opportunity to question them or have questions put to them. The official report of the investigating judge, which was very detailed, bore this out.\r\nThere had in addition been evidence from non-anonymous sources, namely a recorded telephone conversation, statements of named police officers and certain technical evidence, which tended to corroborate the statements of the anonymous police officers. The conviction of the applicants did therefore not rest solely on the latter statements.\r\nB. The Court’s assessment\r\n1. Applicable principles\r\n49.   As the requirements of Article 6 para. 3 (art. 6-3) are to be seen as particular aspects of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), the Court will examine the complaints under Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) taken together (art. 6-1+6-3-d) (see, among many other authorities, the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, pp. 469-70, para. 66).\r\n50.   The Court reiterates that the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them. The Court’s task under the Convention is not to give a ruling as to whether statements of witnesses were properly admitted as evidence, but rather to ascertain whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which evidence was taken, were fair (see, among other authorities, the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67).\r\n51.   In addition, all the evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing, in the presence of the accused, with a view to adversarial argument. There are exceptions to this principle, but they must not infringe the rights of the defence; as a general rule, paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) of Article 6 (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) require that the defendant be given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him, either when he makes his statements or at a later stage (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 49).\r\n52.   As the Court had occasion to state in its Doorson judgment (ibid., p. 470, para. 69), the use of statements made by anonymous witnesses to found a conviction is not under all circumstances incompatible with the Convention.\r\n53.   In that same judgment the Court noted the following:\r\n\"It is true that Article 6 (art. 6) does not explicitly require the interests of witnesses in general, and those of victims called upon to testify in particular, to be taken into consideration. However, their life, liberty or security of person may be at stake, as may interests coming generally within the ambit of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8). Such interests of witnesses and victims are in principle protected by other, substantive provisions of the Convention, which imply that Contracting States should organise their criminal proceedings in such a way that those interests are not unjustifiably imperilled. Against this background, principles of fair trial also require that in appropriate cases the interests of the defence are balanced against those of witnesses or victims called upon to testify.\" (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 70)\r\n54.   However, if the anonymity of prosecution witnesses is maintained, the defence will be faced with difficulties which criminal proceedings should not normally involve. Accordingly, the Court has recognised that in such cases Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d) requires that the handicaps under which the defence labours be sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (ibid., p. 471, para. 72).\r\n55.   Finally, it should be recalled that a conviction should not be based either solely or to a decisive extent on anonymous statements (ibid., p. 472, para. 76).\r\n2. Application of the above principles\r\n56.   In the Court’s opinion, the balancing of the interests of the defence against arguments in favour of maintaining the anonymity of witnesses raises special problems if the witnesses in question are members of the police force of the State. Although their interests - and indeed those of their families - also deserve protection under the Convention, it must be recognised that their position is to some extent different from that of a disinterested witness or a victim. They owe a general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities and usually have links with the prosecution; for these reasons alone their use as anonymous witnesses should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances. In addition, it is in the nature of things that their duties, particularly in the case of arresting officers, may involve giving evidence in open court.\r\n57.   On the other hand, the Court has recognised in principle that, provided that the rights of the defence are respected, it may be legitimate for the police authorities to wish to preserve the anonymity of an agent deployed in undercover activities, for his own or his family’s protection and so as not to impair his usefulness for future operations (see the above-mentioned Lüdi judgment, p. 21, para. 49).\r\n58.   Having regard to the place that the right to a fair administration of justice holds in a democratic society, any measures restricting the rights of the defence should be strictly necessary. If a less restrictive measure can suffice then that measure should be applied.\r\n59.   In the present case, the police officers in question were in a separate room with the investigating judge, from which the accused and even their counsel were excluded. All communication was via a sound link. The defence was thus not only unaware of the identity of the police witnesses but were also prevented from observing their demeanour under direct questioning, and thus from testing their reliability (see the above-mentioned Kostovski judgment, p. 20, para. 42 in fine).\r\n60.   It has not been explained to the Court’s satisfaction why it was necessary to resort to such extreme limitations on the right of the accused to have the evidence against them given in their presence, or why less far-reaching measures were not considered.\r\nIn the absence of any further information, the Court cannot find that the operational needs of the police provide sufficient justification. It should be noted that the explanatory memorandum of the bill which became the Act of 11 November 1993 (see paragraph 42 above) refers in this connection to the possibilities of using make-up or disguise and the prevention of eye contact.\r\n61.   Nor is the Court persuaded that the Court of Appeal made sufficient effort to assess the threat of reprisals against the police officers or their families. It does not appear from that court’s judgment that it sought to address the question whether the applicants would have been in a position to carry out any such threats or to incite others to do so on their behalf. Its decision was based exclusively on the seriousness of the crimes committed (see paragraph 26 above).\r\nIn this connection, it is to be noted that Mr Engelen, a civilian witness who in the early stages of the proceedings had made statements identifying one of the applicants as one of the perpetrators, did not enjoy the protection of anonymity and it has not been claimed that he was at any time threatened.\r\n62.   It is true - as noted by the Government and the Commission (see paragraph 48 above) - that the anonymous police officers were interrogated before an investigating judge, who had himself ascertained their identity and had, in a very detailed official report of his findings, stated his opinion on their reliability and credibility as well as their reasons for remaining anonymous.\r\nHowever these measures cannot be considered a proper substitute for the possibility of the defence to question the witnesses in their presence and make their own judgment as to their demeanour and reliability. It thus cannot be said that the handicaps under which the defence laboured were counterbalanced by the above procedures.\r\n63.   Moreover, the only evidence relied on by the Court of Appeal which provided positive identification of the applicants as the perpetrators of the crimes were the statements of the anonymous police officers. That being so the conviction of the applicants was based \"to a decisive extent\" on these anonymous statements.\r\n64.   In the Court’s view, the present case falls to be distinguished from that of Doorson: in the latter case it was decided on the basis of information contained in the case file itself that the witnesses Y.15 and Y.16 - who were both civilians, and who knew the accused personally - had sufficient reason to believe that he might resort to violence, and they were heard in the presence of counsel (see the above-mentioned Doorson judgment, pp. 454-55, para. 25, pp. 455-56, para. 28, and pp. 470-71, paras. 71 and 73).\r\nIn addition, in the latter case other evidence providing positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crimes charged was available from sources unrelated to the anonymous witnesses (ibid., pp. 458-59, para. 34, and p. 472, para. 76).\r\n65.   Against this background the Court cannot find that the proceedings taken as a whole were fair.\r\nC. Conclusion\r\n66.   There has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-1+6-3-d).\r\nII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 50)\r\n67.   Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50) provides as follows:\r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\r\nA. Damage\r\n68.   The applicants argued that if the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal had not relied on the statements of the anonymous police officers, there would have been no case against them and they would have been acquitted. They each claimed non-pecuniary damage to an amount of 250 Netherlands guilders (NLG) for each day of detention.\r\nThe Government considered the applicants’ claims for damage \"disproportionately high\".\r\nThe Delegate of the Commission did not comment.\r\n69.   The Court considers that in the circumstances this aspect of the case is not yet ready for decision. t is accordingly necessary to reserve it, due regard being had to the possibility of agreements being reached between the respondent State and the applicants.\r\nB. Costs and expenses\r\n70.   The applicants made no claims in respect of costs and expenses incurred in the domestic criminal proceedings.\r\nAs regards the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the European Commission and Court of Human Rights, the applicants’ claims were as follows:\r\nMr van Mechelen and Mr Willem Venerius (represented by Ms Spronken): NLG 16,598.07 including value-added tax;\r\nMr Johan Venerius (represented by Mr Sjöcrona): NLG 30,446.43 including value-added tax;\r\nMr Pruijmboom (represented by Mr Knoops): NLG 11,905 including value-added tax.\r\nThe Government and the Delegate of the Commission did not comment on these claims.\r\n71.   The Court notes that Mr van Mechelen, Mr Johan Venerius and Mr Willem Venerius were granted legal aid by the Convention institutions.\r\n72.   The Court is satisfied that the costs and expenses claimed were actually and necessarily incurred by the applicants in their attempts to obtain redress for the violation found. It also finds the sums claimed by the applicants Van Mechelen, Willem Venerius and Pruijmboom reasonable as to quantum.\r\nOn the other hand, the claim of Mr Johan Venerius is disproportionate when compared with the claims of the other applicants. No explanation has been given for this discrepancy.\r\n73.   The Court awards Mr Pruijmboom the sum claimed.\r\nTo Mr van Mechelen and Mr Willem Venerius jointly it awards the sums claimed, less the amount paid to them by the Council of Europe by way of legal aid, namely 11,412 French francs (FRF).\r\nDeciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards Mr Johan Venerius NLG 20,000 including value-added tax, less the amount paid to him by the Council of Europe by way of legal aid, namely FRF 11,436.\r\nC. Default interest\r\n74.   According to the information available to the Court, the statutory rate of interest applicable in the Netherlands at the date of adoption of the present judgment is 5% per annum.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\r\n1.   Holds by six votes to three that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-1+6-3-d);\r\n\r\n2.   Holds unanimously that the respondent State is to pay, within three months, in respect of costs and expenses,\r\n(a) to the applicants Van Mechelen and Willem Venerius jointly, 16,598 (sixteen thousand five hundred and ninety-eight) Netherlands guilders and 7 (seven) cents, less 11,412 (eleven thousand four hundred and twelve) French francs to be converted into Netherlands guilders at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment;\r\n(b) to the applicant Johan Venerius, 20,000 (twenty thousand) Netherlands guilders, less 11,436 (eleven thousand four hundred and thirty-six) French francs to be converted into Netherlands guilders at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of delivery of the present judgment;\r\n(c) to the applicant Pruijmboom, 11,905 (eleven thousand nine hundred and five) Netherlands guilders;\r\n(d) that simple interest at an annual rate of 5% shall be payable from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement;\r\n\r\n3.   Rejects unanimously the remainder of the claim of the applicant Johan Venerius for reimbursement of costs and expenses;\r\n\r\n4.   Holds unanimously that the question of the application of Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50) in respect of the applicants’ claims for damages is not ready for decision; and consequently,\r\n(a) reserves the said question;\r\n(b) invites the Government and the applicants to submit, within the forthcoming three months, their written observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they may reach;\r\n(c) reserves the further procedure and delegates to the President of the Chamber the power to fix the same if need be.\r\n\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 April 1997.\r\n\r\nRudolf BERNHARDT\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 55 para. 2 of Rules of Court B, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\r\n(a) dissenting opinion of Mr Matscher and Mr Valticos;\r\n(b) dissenting opinion of Mr van Dijk.\r\n\r\nR. B.\r\nH. P. \r\n \r\n\r\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES MATSCHER AND VALTICOS\r\n(Translation)\r\nThis is a borderline case. On the one hand, the conditions in which the trial took place and the witnesses were examined were certainly not entirely satisfactory and no doubt they could have been improved, although it has to be acknowledged that efforts had been made in Netherlands law to adapt the procedure for hearing anonymous witnesses to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as set out in the judgment of Kostovski v. the Netherlands (20 November 1989, Series A no. 166). On the other hand, this was a case of armed robbery and it is understandable that the witnesses - even though they were police officers - should be in fear of reprisals from trigger-happy criminals. Were a similar situation to arise in the future, it would certainly be desirable for even more attention to be paid to the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) when measures were taken.\r\nIn the instant case, however, having regard to all the circumstances, we are unable to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) and concur on the whole with the opinion of Judge van Dijk.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE VAN DIJK\r\n1.   To my regret I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that there has been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 in conjunction with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d). Nor can I follow the majority as regards the essence of the reasoning supporting that conclusion.\r\n2.   Although the Court’s case-law has not yet been fully developed as to the conditions subject to which a conviction in criminal proceedings may be based partly on statements of anonymous witnesses, the Court has drawn certain lines. I am of the opinion that the present judgment is neither within these lines nor a logical continuation thereof, while on the other hand the facts of the case are not specific to such a degree as to justify distinguishing the present case from, especially, the Doorson case (Doorson v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, in which the Netherlands were found not to have acted in violation of Article 6 para. 1 taken together with Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention (art. 6-1+6-3-d)). Even though the Court is not bound by precedent, legal certainty and legal equality require that the Court’s case-law be both consistent and transparent as well as reasonably predictable in so far as the facts of the case are comparable to those of earlier cases.\r\n3.   Since \"the admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter for regulation by national law and as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them\" (see the previously cited Doorson judgment, p. 470, para. 67), the applicable national legislation and case-law and the practice followed by the domestic courts are to some extent relevant also for the Court.\r\nThe Netherlands Supreme Court revised its case-law concerning the conditions under which a conviction may be based on statements of anonymous witnesses in view of the judgment of the Court in the Kostovski case (see paragraph 40 of the present judgment). Moreover, taking that revised case-law as a starting-point and basing itself, inter alia, on an analysis of the Court’s case-law on the admissibility of statements of anonymous witnesses in criminal proceedings and the implications of the Court’s case-law for the relevant domestic law and legal practice in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Government proposed, and the legislature adopted, several amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 42 of the judgment, and the explanatory memorandum to the Act of 1993 cited there).\r\nThe Act of 1993 was not yet in force when the judgments of the domestic courts in the present case were given. However, had it been in force, the procedure followed by the Court of Appeal would have been in conformity with the rules thereby introduced. It is true that the reasons listed in the Act for keeping the identity of a witness secret do not include the desirability, for tactical reasons, of not disclosing the identity of a police officer in order not to impair his future effectiveness. The explanatory memorandum of the Act states in so many words that in the opinion of the Government the public interest in investigating serious crimes cannot alone justify guaranteeing complete anonymity (see paragraphs 41 and 42 of the present judgment). However, the Court of Appeal did not base its acceptance of the wish of the witnesses to remain anonymous on this reason, but on the fear of the witnesses for their lives and safety and those of their families (see paragraph 26 of the present judgment), which is a ground provided for in Article 226a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\r\nThe foregoing does not, of course, guarantee per se that the revised case-law of the Supreme Court and/or the relevant provisions of the amended Code of Criminal Procedure will in all circumstances be found to be in conformity with the Convention. However, as noted above, in this matter the domestic case-law and legislation have a relevance of their own. Moreover, in the present case, in view of the legal background of the relevant Netherlands case-law and the drafting history of the new legislation, in both of which Strasbourg case-law was expressly taken into account, there would seem to be good cause for a presumption of conformity, at least in so far as the issues dealt with have also been considered in the Strasbourg case-law.\r\n4.   Consideration of the various issues involved ultimately led me to the conclusion that Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) have not been violated in the present case. It might have been preferable for the Court of Appeal or the investigating judge to have interrogated the witnesses in the presence of counsel and the Procurator General, the accused being able to follow the proceedings in a separate room. I cannot discover from the case file that was before the Court whether this possibility was considered at all. Be that as it may, taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I am of the opinion that the right of the defence to examine the witnesses was not limited to such an extent that the defence was not given an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question the witnesses, as required by Article 6 paras. 1 and 3 (d) (art. 6-1, art. 6-3-d) (see the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 21, para. 47). I therefore consider the trials to have been fair, taking into account also the compensating elements of the procedure decided on by the Court of Appeal and followed by the investigating judge. In reaching this conclusion I would stress the following aspects:\r\n(a) The anonymous witnesses were not interrogated only by a prosecuting authority, but also by an independent and impartial judge who, judging from his official report of his findings to the Court of Appeal, took great care to compensate the defence for the handicap resulting from the lack of a face-to-face confrontation. The applicants and their counsel were able to hear the interrogation by the investigating judge and to ask questions of their own. In these respects, as was also observed by the Commission, the present case differs from the cases of Kostovski (Kostovski v. the Netherlands judgment of 20 November 1989, Series A no. 166, p. 20, para. 42), Windisch (Windisch v. Austria judgment of 27 September 1990, Series A no. 186, p. 10, para. 27), Lüdi (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49), and Saïdi (Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, pp. 56-57, para. 44). The practice in cases such as the present of having witnesses heard by an investigating judge instead of by the trial court itself was accepted by the Court in its Doorson judgment as being in conformity with the Convention (loc. cit., p. 471, para. 73).\r\n(b) The Court of Appeal has given reasons for delegating the hearing of the witnesses to the investigating judge. The weight which the minority of the Commission laid on the fact that the Court of Appeal, being the trial court, did not avail itself of the possibility to assess for itself the reliability of the witnesses, is in my opinion not conclusive; there is no good reason why the court could not rely for this on the assessment of the equally independent and impartial investigating judge. In that respect, it is also of relevance that the interrogations before the investigating judge did not take place in a pre-trial phase but during a suspension of the trial before the Court of Appeal and pursuant to an order of the Court of Appeal; they formed part of the trial. In the Kostovski case, where the Court emphasised the importance of the possibility for the trial judge to observe the witness, only one of the witnesses was heard by a judge, who was, however, unaware of the identity of the person concerned (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 43).\r\n(c) The statements made before the investigating judge were statements by witnesses who had been identified by the investigating judge as having been, at the relevant moment, sworn police officers who were authorised to perform prosecuting duties invested with investigative competence and were under oath in relation to any statement made in that context (see the Lüdi judgment previously cited p. 21, para. 49).\r\n(d) The investigating judge, who had observed the witnesses during the interrogations, gave a reasoned opinion as to their reliability; this was also intended to compensate the defence for being deprived of the visual information which would have permitted them to test the witnesses’ reliability (see the Windisch judgment previously cited, pp. 10-11, paras. 28-29).\r\n(e) The investigating judge gave his reasoned opinion as to whether the wish of the police officers to remain anonymous was justified; these reasons were also found to be justified by the Court of Appeal on the grounds set out in its judgment. Their shared opinion that the accusations and events were such that fear of violent repercussions was not unsubstantiated cannot be considered unreasonable. Article 6 (art. 6) does not guarantee an unlimited right to question witnesses. It is necessary not only to recognise the discretion of the competent domestic court in maintaining conformity with the exigencies of the proper administration of justice, but also to balance the interests of the defence under Article 6 (art. 6) against the interests of witnesses protected by other substantive provisions of the Convention (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 70). Although in the Lüdi judgment (loc. cit., p. 21, para. 49) the Court considered the interest of the police authorities in preserving the anonymity of their agents \"legitimate\", greater weight should be given in this case, as was done by the Court of Appeal, to the agents’ interest in the protection of their lives and safety and those of their families (Articles 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Convention) (art. 2, art. 3, art. 5, art. 8).\r\n(f) The defence were given ample opportunity to hear and question the witnesses, and to comment on the recording of their answers, and in fact made extensive use of that opportunity; the technical deficiencies complained of were inconvenient and might perhaps have been avoided, but, given especially the extensive time reserved for the hearings and the detailed way in which the statements were recorded, these deficiencies were not such as to hamper the defence to a significant extent.\r\n(g) The Court of Appeal did not exclude beforehand the possibility that additional questions might be put to witnesses at the trial, but was of the opinion that the defence had insufficiently substantiated their wish to do so. Moreover, the defence were offered the possibility to challenge the statements and their use as evidence in open court before the Court of Appeal.\r\n(h) The convictions were not based solely upon the statements of anonymous witnesses. Although these were undoubtedly the core of the evidence, there were also statements by identified witnesses, there was some technical evidence and there was the recording of the telephone conversation. In this respect, too, the Court should recognise that \"as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them\".\r\nIn the Doorson judgment, in which the criterion of \"decisive extent\" was developed and applied (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), the Court found that this criterion had been met in a situation where the conviction was based, in addition to statements of anonymous witnesses, on a statement made by an identified witness to the police but retracted during the trial and a statement by an identified witness who disappeared before the defence had had the opportunity to question him (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76, in conjunction with pp. 458-59, para. 34).\r\nIn view of all these aspects of the case I come to the conclusion that the trial which led to the applicants’ conviction was \"fair\" in the sense of Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) as construed in the Court’s previous case-law.\r\nHaving stated my conclusion I wish, with due respect, to make the following observations with regard to the reasoning on which the majority bases its conclusion.\r\n5.   Like the majority, and in accordance with the case-law of the Court, I take as my starting-point that evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing. Therefore, I find in the abstract that interrogation of the police officers at the trial before the Court of Appeal, in disguise if necessary to protect their anonymity, would have been preferable. However, I also take note of the opinion of the Court of Appeal that this would have been too risky because disclosure of the identity of the witnesses could not have been excluded. I would have preferred it if the Court of Appeal had given concrete arguments for that opinion. On the other hand, I lack the expertise - as, I assume, do my colleagues in the Court - to judge whether its fear was justified or not. Then again, one may well wonder whether the defence would have been in a better position to observe the witnesses’ demeanour and test their reliability had they appeared in disguise, given the fact that an effective disguise may also substantially disguise the sound and intonation of the voice and the body language of the person concerned. A national court may in general be considered to be in a better position to judge such a complex and factual issue than is our Court, which should substitute its judgment for that of the national court only if the latter’s judgment is unreasonable. From the wording of the Doorson judgment it is clear that in that case the Court recognised this primary responsibility of the national court.\r\n6.   The fact that police officers were fired at in pursuit does not necessarily mean that at a later stage, during or after the trial, their lives and safety and/or those of their families were in danger. However, on both points the national authorities - in this case the national courts - should be left some latitude to balance the interests of the defence against those of the witnesses (see the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 470, para. 71, where a reasonableness test was applied). In my opinion the Court of Appeal has not overstepped the mark in finding that the risk of disclosure of the identity of the witnesses was present and that their fear for their lives and safety or those of their families was justified in view of the seriousness of the crimes committed and the violence used.\r\nI disagree with the majority that the Court of Appeal failed to make any real effort to assess the threat of reprisals. The Court of Appeal had at its disposal the report of findings of the investigating judge, in which the latter referred not only to the statements made on this subject by the police officers concerned - which were in some cases supported by previous experience (paragraphs 17 and 21 of the judgment) - but also gave his own evaluation, based upon the seriousness of the crimes and the violence used by the perpetrators. Given these reasoned opinions of both the investigating judge and the Court of Appeal, the latter of which was reviewed by the Supreme Court, the Government were not called upon to give an explanation of their own, as held by the majority (see paragraph 60 of the judgment); nor in my opinion would the Government have been in a position to do so.\r\nIn the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., pp. 470-71, para. 71) the Court found that an actual threat against the witnesses was not required for the decision to maintain their anonymity to be reasonable, and that previous experience might be relevant. In the present case it should also be taken into consideration that some of the witnesses had been wounded while pursuing the robbers. Even if one were to take the position that a certain risk is implicit in the profession of police officer, that should not mean that the latter has to take unnecessary risks and it certainly does not mean that the lives and safety of his family deserve any less protection than that of other persons. The \"general duty of obedience to the State’s executive authorities\" (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) owed by policemen cannot imply that their lives and safety and those of their families are any less worthy of protection. Therefore I cannot agree with the majority that, for the sole reason that in the present case members of the police force were involved, the case has to be distinguished from that of Doorson as far as the balancing of the interests of the defence against those of witnesses is concerned.\r\nThe fact that Mr Engelen, who had originally made a highly incriminating statement, was not granted anonymity by the police and nevertheless did not suffer any harm at the hands of the applicants cannot be decisive in this context. The police may have made a mistake in his case by revealing his identity, but in any case later events do not automatically and retrospectively invalidate a reasonable assessment of a risk. One can hardly blame a witness who expresses serious fears for not waiting until something serious happens to him or any other witness; the only criterion for the national court to consider is the reasonableness of the fear.\r\n7.   I fail to see why policemen should be under a special duty to give evidence in open court (see paragraph 56 of the judgment) since this is a general civic duty prescribed by law. And even if one may agree that the use of policemen as anonymous witnesses \"should be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances\" (ibid.), one may argue on the other hand that their anonymity should meet with fewer objections from the point of view of the defence, because their statements are statements by sworn professionals, whose identity and investigative competence can easily be checked by the investigating judge.\r\n8.   The majority also deal with the question whether \"operational needs\" provided sufficient justification for preserving the anonymity of the police officers. Reference is made in that context to the explanatory memorandum of the Act of 11 November 1993 in which the Netherlands Government indicate that in their opinion that interest can be sufficiently protected by less far-reaching restrictions on the rights of the defence. However, in my opinion that issue is of only minor importance in the present case, since the Court of Appeal stated in its judgment that, of the arguments advanced by the witnesses for claiming anonymity, it considered the argument concerning the personal safety of these witnesses and their families to be \"decisive\" (see paragraph 26 of the judgment).\r\n9.   It cannot be denied - and indeed it has not been denied - that the possibilities for the defence to interrogate the witnesses were not without limitations. Nor are they always without limitations in normal situations, where the identity of the witnesses is known to the defence. The fact that certain questions were not answered by witnesses and that this was accepted by the investigating judge may be open to criticism but this would in all probability also have occurred had the witnesses been interrogated in open court in some form of disguise. It may therefore be questioned whether it was necessary and proportionate to refuse to answer certain questions put by the defence in order to protect the anonymity of the witnesses and the secrecy of the police tactics. However, this question has to be answered primarily by the competent domestic court, and indeed it was answered in the affirmative by the investigating judge, and after his decision was challenged by the defence before the Court of Appeal, by the latter as well. On the whole, in my opinion, neither the limitations necessitated by the situation nor those accepted by the investigating judge were such as to warrant the finding that there was no \"adequate and proper opportunity to question the witnesses\" as required by the Court in its Kostovski judgment (loc. cit., p. 20, para. 41). The handicaps under which the defence laboured were, therefore, sufficiently counterbalanced by the procedures followed by the judicial authorities (see the Kostovski judgment previously cited, p. 21, para. 43, and the Doorson judgment previously cited, p. 472, para. 76).\r\n10.   Finally, although the statements of the anonymous witnesses were an essential part of the evidence, it cannot be said that the convictions were based solely on these statements. Whether they were based on these statements \"to a decisive extent\", as the majority holds (paragraph 63 of the judgment), is hard to say. I share the opinion expressed by the Delegate of the Commission at the Court’s hearing that this criterion, laid down in the Doorson judgment (loc. cit., p. 472, para. 76), is difficult to apply, because if the testimony of anonymous witnesses is used by the court as part of the evidence, that will always be because the court considers it a \"decisive\" part of that evidence, making the proof complete or at least sufficient. Here again, the Court’s finding that \"as a general rule it is for the national courts to assess the evidence before them\" (paragraph 50 of the present judgment) should prevail. Moreover, as already mentioned (see paragraph 3 (h) above), in this respect the facts of the case would not seem to differ substantially from those of the Doorson case.\r\n\r\n",

MUCHA D. SVÁBY\r\nE. KONSTANTINOV\r\n\r\nMr.\tH.C. KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\nHaving regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the application introduced on 28 May 1993 by Alexander FINDLAY against the United Kingdom and registered on 22 June 1993 under file No. 22107/93;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to :\r\n\r\n-\tthe reports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n-\tthe observations submitted by the respondent Government on 19 April 1994, the observations in reply submitted by the applicant on 3 June 1994 and the supplementary observations submitted by the respondent Government on 10 February 1995;\r\n\r\n-\tthe parties' oral submissions at the hearing on 23 February 1995;\r\n\r\nHaving deliberated;\r\n\r\nDecides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The applicant is a British citizen born in 1961 and resident in\r\nWindsor. He is represented before the Commission by Mr. John McKenzie,\r\na solicitor practising in London.\r\n\r\n      The applicant joined the British Army in 1980 when he became a\r\nmember of the Scots Guards. His service was due to terminate in or\r\naround October or November 1992 when he would have received a\r\nResettlement Grant and, at the age of 60, an army pension.\r\n\r\n      On 28 September 1981 the applicant was sentenced by a military\r\ncourt to 50 days' imprisonment for absence without leave.\r\n\r\n      In 1982 the applicant took part in the Falklands campaign. He was\r\nwounded. He saved another soldier's life by administering a tracheotomy\r\nto him with a biro pen. The applicant suffered extreme stress as a\r\nresult of his experiences.\r\n\r\n      Subsequently the applicant had three further convictions before\r\nmilitary courts. On 29 November 1984 he was reduced to the rank of\r\nguardsman due to his failure to follow the correct sick leave procedure\r\nand for absence without leave. On 27 May 1986 the applicant was again\r\nreduced in rank for failing to report for a course. On 19 February 1987\r\nthe applicant was convicted of theft and of using a false instrument.\r\n\r\n      In 1987, the applicant sustained an injury during training for\r\nservice in Northern Ireland. He fell from a rope and broke his arm and\r\nseverely damaged his back. His back injury affected his performance\r\nduring training and he suffered from depression as a result.\r\n\r\n      In or about 1990, the applicant, who had become a Lance Sergeant,\r\nwas serving with his regiment in Northern Ireland. On 29 July 1990,\r\nafter a heavy drinking session, he held members of his own unit at\r\npistol point and threatened to kill himself and certain of his\r\ncolleagues. He fired two shots which were not aimed at anyone and\r\nsubsequently surrendered the pistol. The applicant was then arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n       On 31 July 1990 an army psychiatrist (\"Doctor A\") examined the\r\napplicant and stated that the applicant was responsible for his actions\r\nat the time of the incident. However it was a combination of a number\r\nof stresses (including his back injury and posting in Northern Ireland)\r\ntogether with the applicant's heavy drinking on the day that led to the\r\n\"almost inevitable\" event. Doctor A recommended \"awarding the minimum\r\nappropriate punishment\" to the applicant.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was charged by the Convening Officer (\"the C.O.\")\r\nwith eight offences (six civilian and two military), pursuant to the\r\nArmy Act 1955. The C.O. decided that the applicant should be tried by\r\ngeneral court-martial rather than by a civilian court or other form of\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\n      In order to establish that the applicant was fit to stand trial,\r\nthe applicant was examined, at the request of the army, by another army\r\npsychiatrist (\"Doctor B\"), who was a civilian consultant psychiatrist\r\nwith the Ministry of Defence since 1980. Her report, produced in\r\nJanuary 1991, confirmed that the applicant was fit to plead, knew what\r\nhe was doing at the time of the incident, but his chronic back problem\r\n(which meant he was frustrated and depressed by not being fit for duty\r\nin his Northern Ireland posting), and \"his previous combat stresses and\r\na very high level of alcohol ... combined to produce this dangerous\r\nbehaviour.\"\r\n\r\n      In March 1991 Doctor B produced another report, at the request\r\nof the army, confirming that while it was clear what were the stresses\r\non the applicant, the nature of his reaction to them on the day in\r\nquestion was to be explained by the applicant's experiences in the\r\nFalklands war. She confirmed that similar incidents occurred in those\r\nwho had previously experienced Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (\"PTSD\")\r\nand such incidents seemed to be a late feature of PTSD. Doctor B did\r\nnot clearly say that the applicant suffered from PTSD. She confirmed\r\nthat the consumption of alcohol on the relevant day was due to the\r\napplicant's condition and not a cause of it.\r\n\r\n      The prosecuting officer assigned to the case therefore requested\r\nthe attendance of Doctor B at the court-martial to be convened, but\r\nDoctor B indicated that she was unwilling to attend. The applicant's\r\nrepresentative was then informed of Doctor B's response. In addition,\r\nby letter dated 24 June 1991 the prosecutor wrote to the applicant's\r\nrepresentative offering to secure the attendance of any doctors who may\r\nhave treated the applicant, requesting that the applicant's\r\nrepresentative indicate which doctors he would require to attend a\r\ncourt-martial, and stating expressly that the prosecuting officer\r\nanticipated that Doctor B's attendance may be required. No response was\r\nreceived from the applicant's representative despite a further\r\nreminder, dated 16 July 1991, sent on behalf of the C.O..\r\n\r\n      In July 1991 the applicant brought a civil action against the\r\nSecretary of State for Defence on the basis of the negligence of the\r\narmy medical authorities in failing to diagnose and treat his PTSD and\r\nalso (but forming a lesser part of this action) in respect of his back\r\ninjury received during training in 1987.\r\n\r\n      In October 1991 a third psychiatrist (\"Doctor C\") produced a\r\nreport which clearly confirmed that the applicant was suffering from\r\nPTSD as a result of the Falklands conflict and that the combination of\r\nthe frustration and depression due to his chronic back problem, his\r\nposting in Northern Ireland and the consumption of alcohol triggered\r\nthe incident. In addition Doctor C was of the opinion that the\r\napplicant was psychotic, out of touch with reality and did not know\r\nwhat he was doing at the time of the incident.\r\n\r\n      By order dated 31 October 1991 the C.O. convened a general court-\r\nmartial. The C.O. was a Major General and was General Officer\r\nCommanding (\"GOC\") of the London District and Household Division.\r\n\r\n      The court-martial comprised a President and four other members\r\nand all were subordinate in rank to the C.O.:\r\n\r\n      - The President was a Colonel in the Territorial Army and TA\r\n      Adviser HQ, London District. He was appointed by name by the C.O.\r\n      and was not a permanent president.\r\n\r\n      - Member B was a Lieutenant Colonel (Royal Anglian) and his diary\r\n      was administered by the London District. He was appointed by name\r\n      by the C.O. and was a permanent president sitting in the capacity\r\n      of ordinary member.\r\n\r\n      - Member C was a Captain (2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards)\r\n      stationed in the London District. He was appointed to the court-\r\n      martial by his commanding officer.\r\n\r\n      - Member D was a Major (2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards) stationed\r\n      in London District and the C.O., as GOC, was this member's second\r\n      superior reporting officer. He was appointed to the court-martial\r\n      by his commanding officer.\r\n\r\n      - Member E was a Captain (Postal and Courier Department, Royal\r\n      Engineers (Women's Royal Army Corps)) appointed by her commanding\r\n      officer. The Postal and Courier Depot is under the direct command\r\n      of the Ministry of Defence and is administered by the London\r\n      District.\r\n\r\n      The assistant prosecuting and defending officers were both\r\nofficers from the 2nd Scots Guards stationed in the London District.\r\n\r\n      The Judge Advocate (\"J.A.\") was a barrister on general secondment\r\nto the office of Judge Advocate General until February 1996.\r\n\r\n      On 2 November 1991, though not fully cognisant of the opinion of\r\nDoctor B at that time, the applicant's representatives made a written\r\nrequest to the prosecuting authorities to ensure the appearance of\r\nDoctor B at the court-martial. On 5 November 1991, the prosecutor\r\nissued a witness summons requiring Doctor B's attendance.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 11 November 1991 the applicant appeared before the general\r\ncourt-martial. Doctor B did not appear in answer to the witness\r\nsummons. The applicant was told that Doctor B would not be available\r\nand he claims that it was for this reason that he pleaded guilty to\r\nseven of the charges on the charge sheet (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8).\r\nCharges 2, 4 and 5 were charges of common assault (civilian offences),\r\ncharges 3 and 6 were charges of conduct to the prejudice of good order\r\nand military discipline (a military offence) and charges 7 and 8 were\r\ncharges of threatening to kill (a civilian offence). The applicant's\r\nrepresentative did not apply for an adjournment of the proceedings (in\r\nlight of Doctor B's absence) nor object to any of the members of the\r\ncourt-martial hearing the case.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was also presented with a second charge sheet which\r\nhe had not seen before and which contained two charges of a\r\ndisciplinary nature related to the consumption and storage of alcohol.\r\nHe pleaded guilty to the former and not guilty to the latter charge.\r\n\r\n      The applicant introduced to the court-martial, at the beginning\r\nof his case, the above described reports prepared by Doctors A, B and\r\nC. Doctor C was called by the applicant to give evidence in relation\r\nto PTSD. He confirmed in direct evidence his view that the applicant\r\nsuffered from PTSD, that the effect on the applicant of the Falklands\r\nwar was the main reason for his behaviour, that the applicant was not\r\nresponsible for what he was doing at the time of the incident and that\r\nthe applicant was in need of counselling for what was a well recognised\r\ndisorder. During cross-examination Doctor C stated that this was, in\r\nfact, the first time he had dealt with battle-related PTSD.\r\n\r\n      The applicant's representative urged the court-martial that, in\r\nlight of the applicant's condition (demonstrated by the psychiatric\r\nreports) and the little likelihood of his re-offending, the applicant\r\nshould be allowed to complete the few remaining months of his service\r\nand leave the army with his pension intact and a minimal endorsement\r\non his record.\r\n\r\n       The applicant claims that during the trial the J.A. was hostile\r\nto the applicant's representative. In the first place, the Prosecutor\r\nintroduced, under rule 71(3)(a) of the Army Rules of Procedure (1972),\r\nmitigating evidence as to the applicant's record since the incident.\r\nEvidence was given to the effect that the applicant's conduct in the\r\nyear since the offence had been described by his company commander as\r\nimpeccable and that his commanding officer wished to retain the\r\nservices of the applicant in his battalion. The J.A. interrupted and\r\ncommented as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"J.A. - That is the view of the Commanding Officer, who is aware,\r\n      is he, that the accused has been found guilty by this court of\r\n      two offences of making a threat to kill members of his unit, and\r\n      the Commanding Officer wishes to retain him in the Battalion does\r\n      he ?\".\r\n\r\n      It is the applicant's recollection that the J.A. snapped a pencil\r\nin irritation while speaking as above.\r\n\r\n      Secondly Doctor C gave evidence to the effect that the applicant,\r\nwhile suffering from PTSD, was not suffering from any other form of\r\nmental illness. The J.A. interrupted this evidence to ask for a pause\r\nto make a note of this point.\r\n\r\n      No psychiatric evidence was introduced by the Prosecutor either\r\nto rebut the reports and evidence submitted by the applicant or in\r\nfurtherance of the Prosecutor's obligation, under rule 71(3)(a) of the\r\nArmy Rules of Procedure (1972), to introduce evidence of matters which\r\nmay have made the accused more susceptible to the commission of the\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n      The general court-martial sentenced the applicant to 2 years'\r\nimprisonment, reduction to the rank of guardsman and dismissal from the\r\narmy. No reasons were given for the level of the sentence (though the\r\ncourt-martial noted the period of time the applicant had already been\r\nin custody on the charges). The applicant thereby suffered a reduction\r\nin his pension entitlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The applicant petitioned the Confirming Officer for a reduction\r\nin sentence. The Confirming Officer was in fact the C.O. who had\r\nappointed himself Confirming Officer under section 111 of the Army Act\r\n1955.  The Confirming Officer received the advice of the Judge Advocate\r\nGeneral's office and, on 16 December 1991, the applicant was informed\r\nthat the sentence had been upheld.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was then removed from his unit to begin his\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n      The applicant petitioned the first Reviewing Authority (the\r\nDeputy Director General of Personal Services as delegate of the Army\r\nBoard) concerning his sentence. That officer, who was not legally\r\nqualified, also obtained advice from the Judge Advocate General's\r\noffice. By letter dated 22 January 1992, the applicant was informed\r\nthat this petition had been rejected.\r\n\r\n      The applicant then petitioned the Director General of Personal\r\nServices (also not legally qualified) as delegate of the Army Board in\r\nrelation to his sentence. His petition was rejected on 10 March 1992.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was not informed of the identity of the Confirming\r\nOfficer or of either of the Reviewing Authorities. He was not informed\r\nthat advice had been obtained from the Judge Advocate General's office\r\nor of the nature of that advice. In addition the applicant was not\r\ngiven reasons for the decisions confirming his sentence and rejecting\r\nhis petitions.\r\n\r\n      By application dated 10 March 1992, the applicant applied to the\r\nDivisional Court of the High Court for leave to challenge, by judicial\r\nreview, the validity of the findings of the court-martial. In this\r\napplication, the applicant challenged his sentence as being excessive\r\nand alleged that the proceedings were contrary to the rules of natural\r\njustice. On 14 December 1992, the Divisional Court refused leave on the\r\nbasis that the conduct of the court-martial had been entirely in\r\naccordance with the Army Act 1955. In particular the Divisional Court\r\nfound that the J.A.'s interventions were appropriate and noted that the\r\napplicant's representative had accepted at the court-martial hearing\r\nthat the intervention by the J.A. during Doctor C's evidence was\r\ncorrect and appropriate.\r\n\r\n      A report dated 16 January 1994 was subsequently prepared by\r\nDoctor B for the purposes of the civil action against the Secretary of\r\nState confirming her previous opinion, though now clearly labelling the\r\neffect of the Falklands conflict on the applicant as PTSD. In March\r\n1984 the applicant's civil action was settled by the Secretary of State\r\nfor Defence by paying the applicant £100,000, though the settlement did\r\nnot differentiate between the claim in respect of PTSD and the back\r\ninjury. The applicant claims that this was an effective acknowledgement\r\nby the Secretary of State for Defence that the applicant suffered from\r\nPTSD on the day of the incident because prior to the settlement the\r\napplicant was examined by a psychiatrist acting for the Secretary of\r\nState who offered the applicant treatment for PTSD.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The law and procedures in respect of courts-martial for army\r\npersonnel are contained in the Army Act 1955 (\"the 1955 Act\") and in\r\nthe Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972 (\"the 1972 Rules\"). Under section\r\n70 (1) of the 1955 Act, \"civilian\" offences are also offences under the\r\n1955 Act. Therefore, even if the charges involve civilian and army\r\noffences, in most cases army personnel can be tried by the army\r\nauthorities on all charges under the 1955 Act. Serious offences against\r\narmy law can be tried by district, field or general court-martial.\r\n\r\n      A general court-martial must consist of a President (normally a\r\nbrigadier or colonel in the army) and at least four other officers in\r\nthe army. A Judge Advocate (\"the J.A.\") must also be appointed to a\r\ngeneral court-martial. A general court-martial will be convened by a\r\nConvening Officer (\"C.O.\") who is normally a major-general in the army.\r\nThe President of the court-martial must be appointed by name by the\r\nC.O., and the remaining members may be appointed by name, or by the\r\nC.O. requiring a particular commanding officer of a unit to nominate\r\nan officer of the required rank.\r\n\r\n       Each member of the court-martial must swear the following oath:\r\n\r\n      \"I swear by almighty God that I will well and truly try the\r\n      accused before the court according to the evidence, and that I\r\n      will duly administer justice according to the Army Act 1955,\r\n      without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear\r\n      that I will not on any account at any time whatsoever disclose\r\n      or discover the vote or opinion of the president or any member\r\n      of this court-martial, unless thereunto required in the due\r\n      course of law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       The C.O. must be a \"Qualified Officer\" (meaning he must be at\r\nleast a field officer or of a corresponding rank) who is in command of\r\na body of the regular forces or in command of the unit within which the\r\nperson to be tried is serving. The Qualified Officer can delegate this\r\npower to an officer under his command but not to an officer below the\r\nrank of colonel.\r\n\r\n      The powers and duties of the C.O. in relation to the prosecution\r\nare, inter alia, to direct upon what charges the accused is to be tried\r\nand to decide the wording of those charges. The C.O. decides on the\r\ntype of court-martial required and convenes a court-martial for each\r\ncase. The convening order specifies, inter alia, the date, place and\r\ntime of the trial, the name of the President and the details of the\r\nother members. The C.O. ensures that a J.A. is appointed by the Judge\r\nAdvocate General's office, or failing such appointment, appoints the\r\nJ.A. himself. He also appoints the Prosecutor or directs a commanding\r\nofficer to appoint an officer to prosecute. The C.O. sends an abstract\r\nof the evidence to the Prosecutor and to the J.A., and may indicate to\r\nthe Prosecutor the passages of the evidence which may be inadmissible.\r\nHe procures the attendance at trial of all witnesses to be called for\r\nthe prosecution.\r\n\r\n      In relation to the defence, the C.O.'s powers and duties include\r\nensuring that the accused has a proper opportunity to prepare his\r\ndefence and that the accused has proper contact with, inter alia, his\r\nwitnesses. The C.O. must see that the accused is informed that he may\r\nrequire the attendance of defence witnesses and must order the\r\nattendance of witnesses \"reasonably\" requested by the defence. No other\r\nauthority has this power. Witnesses not subject to military law may be\r\nsummoned to attend the trial by order of the C.O.. The accused must\r\nalso be informed by the C.O. if the prosecutor is legally qualified so\r\nthat the accused has the opportunity to obtain his own legal\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n      The court-martial can be dissolved by the C.O. either before or\r\nduring the trial when required in the interests of the administration\r\nof justice (section 95 of the 1955 Act). The C.O. also acts as\r\nConfirming Officer. Finally, before charges can be withdrawn the C.O.\r\nmust consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The current Judge Advocate General was appointed to the office\r\nby the Queen in February 1991 for 5 years. He is answerable to the\r\nQueen and is removable from office by the Queen for inability or\r\nmisbehaviour.\r\n\r\n      A number of assistant and deputy J.A.'s are appointed to the\r\nJudge Advocate General's office by the Lord Chancellor and they must\r\nhave at least seven and five years experience respectively as an\r\nadvocate or barrister. One of these J.A.'s is assigned to a courts\r\nmartial by the Judge Advocate General's office or by the C.O. himself.\r\nThe J.A. does not swear an oath upon appointment and is normally\r\nexempted from doing so at individual courts-martial. The J.A. is\r\nremovable only by the Lord Chancellor for inability or misbehaviour but\r\nis responsible for the proper discharge of his functions to the Judge\r\nAdvocate General. The Judge Advocate General and the J.A.'s receive,\r\nout of money provided by parliament, such remuneration as the Lord\r\nChancellor may determine.\r\n\r\n      The Judge Advocate General's role is mainly advisory. He advises\r\nthe Secretary of State for Defence on all legal matters pertaining to\r\nhis appointment, the confirming and reviewing authorities on post-trial\r\nmatters and the Ministry of Defence on legal matters. He is also\r\nresponsible for superintending the administration of army law and\r\nretaining the records of court-martials.\r\n\r\n      Once assigned to a court-martial the J.A. must provide, on\r\nrequest, an opinion on any point of law or procedure to the prosecution\r\nand the accused either outside of or during the court-martial. He\r\nadvises on all questions of law and procedure that arise during the\r\nhearing and the court-martial must accept his advice unless it has\r\nweighty reasons for not doing so. On a number of specified matters, on\r\nwhich he is consulted by the court-martial, the opinion of the J.A.\r\nmust be followed. The J.A. is also responsible for advising the court-\r\nmartial as to any defect in its constitution or in the charge sheet.\r\n\r\n      At the close of the trial, the J.A. sums up the relevant law and\r\nevidence. If during the court-martial's deliberations on the charges\r\n(at which the J.A. cannot be present) further advice is required then\r\nthe court-martial must receive that advice in open court. The J.A. can,\r\nhowever, advise the court-martial in private on the general principles\r\ngoverning the approach to sentencing. The J.A. is not a member of the\r\ncourt-martial and has no vote in the decision on the charges or on the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n      Finally, the J.A. must ensure (in conjunction with the President)\r\nthat the accused does not suffer any disadvantage during the hearing.\r\nWhere an accused pleads guilty the J.A. should explain to the accused\r\nthe nature of the charges, the resulting difference in procedures and\r\nthe full import of his plea. If the accused or his representatives\r\nsubsequently make submissions that might imply that the accused is not\r\nguilty of the charges, the J.A. has a duty to satisfy the court-martial\r\nthat the accused and his representative are not under any\r\nmisapprehension as to the plea of guilty, and that the accused's clear\r\nadmission has addressed all elements of all charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n      When the applicant pleads guilty, the Prosecutor outlines the\r\nfacts and must then, pursuant to Rule 71(3)(a) of the 1972 Rules, put\r\nin evidence any circumstance which may have made the accused more\r\nsusceptible to the commission of the offence by way of mitigation. The\r\ndefence then makes a plea in mitigation. The members of the court-\r\nmartial retire (with the J.A.) to consider the sentence, decide, return\r\nand announce the sentence. There is no provision for the giving of\r\nreasons by the court-martial for its decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Certain types of sentences are not available to a court-martial\r\neven if the charges are civilian. A court-martial cannot suspend a\r\nprison sentence, issue a probation order, sentence to community service\r\nor issue orders under the mental health legislation. Moreover the level\r\nof sentencing power depends on the type of court-martial that is\r\nconvened. A district court-martial is more restricted in terms of\r\nsentencing than a general court-martial. The maximum sentence laid down\r\nby the 1955 Act and civilian law, for the charges on the first charge\r\nsheet in respect of which the applicant pleaded guilty, are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Charges 2, 4 and 5: six months' imprisonment or a fine\r\n- Charge 7: 10 years' imprisonment\r\n- Charges 3 and 6: imprisonment not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\n      The court-martial must award one global sentence in relation to\r\nall the offences in respect of which the accused is found guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n      (a) A Courts-Martial Appeal Court can hear appeals from a court-\r\nmartial but there is no provision for such an appeal against sentence\r\nin circumstances where the accused pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\n      (b) The court-martial's findings are not treated as a finding of\r\nguilt or a sentence until confirmed by the Confirming Officer (normally\r\nthe C.O. or any officer superior in command to the C.O.). The\r\nconfirmation procedure is automatic but if a petition is presented\r\nprior to the decision of the Confirming officer it will be considered.\r\nPrior to confirmation the Confirming Officer must consult the Judge\r\nAdvocate General's office for advice, but the actual J.A. who attended\r\nthe court-martial hearing does not proffer this advice. That advice is\r\nnot disclosed to the appellant on grounds of legal privilege and/or\r\npublic interest immunity. The Confirming Officer can withhold\r\nconfirmation, substitute a sentence, remit in whole or in part any\r\npunishment, commute a punishment for one or more lesser punishments and\r\npostpone the carrying out of the sentence.\r\n\r\n      (c) Once the Confirming Officer has confirmed the sentence, the\r\ndefendant can petition the Reviewing Authorities. A petitioner can have\r\nmore than one review. The relevant Reviewing Authorities were the\r\nQueen, the Army Board as delegate of the Defence Council, the Deputy\r\nDirector and the Director General of Personal Services (Army) at the\r\nMinistry of Defence as delegate of the Army Board and any officer\r\nsuperior in command to the Confirming Officer. The Reviewing\r\nAuthorities may consult the Judge Advocate General's office for advice\r\nand have the power to quash a sentence and to exercise the same powers\r\nas the Confirming Officer in relation to substituting, remitting or\r\ncommuting the sentence.\r\n\r\n      A petitioner is not informed, when making the relevant petition,\r\nof the identity of the Confirming Officer or of the Reviewing\r\nAuthorities. No statutory or formalised procedures are laid down for\r\nthe conduct of the post-hearing reviews and no reasons are given for\r\ndecisions delivered subsequent to the post-hearing reviews. Neither the\r\nfact of, nor the nature of, the advice received from the Judge Advocate\r\nGeneral's office by these bodies is disclosed to a petitioner, as this\r\nadvice is considered legally privileged or covered by public interest\r\nimmunity.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant makes a number of complaints under Article 6 para.\r\n1 of the Convention:\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains that he did not receive a fair hearing\r\nbefore the court-martial and in particular he complains in relation to:\r\n\r\n      (a) the alleged lack of equality of arms between the prosecution\r\n      and defence;\r\n\r\n      (b) the inaction of the C.O. in relation to the attendance of a\r\n      vital defence witness, and the conduct of the prosecution in\r\n      respect of the psychiatric evidence. This meant that the\r\n      applicant had to plead guilty and was then prevented from\r\n      presenting his best plea in mitigation;\r\n\r\n      (c) the failure to inform the applicant of the advice given by\r\n      the J.A. in private to the court-martial in relation to\r\n      sentencing;\r\n\r\n      (d) the failure of the court-martial to give reasons for its\r\n      decision on sentence; and\r\n\r\n      (e) the alleged hostility of the J.A. during the hearing.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant also complains that he did not receive a fair\r\nhearing in relation to the post-hearing reviews as these procedures\r\nwere appeals but were essentially administrative in nature and\r\nconducted in private.\r\n\r\n      In particular, he complains about the failure to give reasons for\r\neach of the decisions, to identify the persons making those decisions\r\nor to inform the applicant of the advice given by the Judge Advocate\r\nGeneral's office. The applicant also complains specifically about the\r\nfact that neither of the Reviewing Authorities was legally qualified,\r\nwhich implies that, when the first review took place on the basis of\r\nthe advice of the Judge Advocate General's office, it was likely that\r\nsuch advice would be followed. The second Reviewing Authority did not\r\nseek any such advice, and therefore a person without any legal\r\nqualifications or advice made the final decision on the applicant's\r\npetition against sentence. The applicant also complains about the lack\r\nof statutory or otherwise formal rules, procedures or oaths in relation\r\nto the conduct of the post-hearing reviews.\r\n\r\n3.    The applicant further complains that the internal organisation\r\nand structure of the court-martial, the Confirming Officer and the\r\nReviewing Authorities meant that those bodies were not, or in the\r\nalternative were not seen to be, independent or impartial. In\r\nparticular the applicant refers to:\r\n\r\n      (a) the fact that neither the court-martial, the Confirming\r\n      Officer nor the Reviewing Authorities were independent of the\r\n      prosecuting authority;\r\n\r\n      (b) the employment of the J.A. by the Ministry of Defence, the\r\n      advice of the J.A. given in private, the alleged hostility of the\r\n      J.A. during the court-martial and the subsequent involvement of\r\n      the Judge Advocate General's office in advising, in private,\r\n      during the post-hearing reviews;\r\n\r\n      (c) the position and wide powers of the C.O., that officer's\r\n      numerous roles prior to, during and after the hearing, his\r\n      appointment of the members of the court-martial and the\r\n      relationship between those members and the C.O.;\r\n\r\n      (d) the appointment of members for a specific court-martial only;\r\n      and\r\n\r\n      (e) the fact that the Judge Advocate General's office acted as\r\n      legal adviser at the hearing, as prosecutor at the confirming\r\n      stage and as prosecutor and appeal authority at the review\r\n      stages.\r\n\r\n4.    In addition the applicant complains that the decisions of the\r\ncourt-martial and in the post-hearing reviews were unreasonable in view\r\nof the psychiatric evidence submitted by the applicant.\r\n\r\n5.    Finally the applicant complains that he was subjected to an\r\nunreasonably limited sentencing regime (in comparison with that\r\navailable in civilian courts) as a consequence of the unappealable\r\ndecision by the C.O. to try him by general court-martial.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 28 May 1993 and registered on\r\n22 June 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 1 December 1993 the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the respondent Government and invite them to submit\r\nwritten observations on the admissibility and merits of the\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were received, after two extensions\r\nof the time-limit fixed for this purpose, on 19 April 1994 and the\r\napplicant's observations in reply were received on 3 June 1994.\r\n\r\n      On 7 December 1995 the Commission decided to invite the parties\r\nto a hearing, which was held on 23 February 1995. At the hearing the\r\nGovernment were represented by Mr. J. Rankin, Agent, Foreign and\r\nCommonwealth Office, Mr. P. Havers and Mr. N. May, both of Counsel, and\r\nMs. J. Murnane, Major-General A. Rodgers and Air Vice Marshal G.\r\nCarlton, as advisers. The applicant was represented by Mr. J. MacKenzie\r\nand Mr. G. Blades, Solicitors.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicant raises a number of complaints under Article 6 para.\r\n1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention in relation to the court-martial, the\r\nConvening Officer and the Reviewing Authorities and in respect of his\r\nhearings and petitions before those bodies.\r\n\r\n      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1), insofar as is relevant, reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      \"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against\r\n      him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ...\r\n      by an independent and impartial tribunal established by\r\n      law.\"\r\n\r\n      In the first place, the applicant complains that neither the\r\ncourt-martial, the Convening Officer nor the Reviewing Authorities\r\nwere, or could be perceived to be, independent or impartial.\r\n\r\n      In this regard, the applicant mainly focuses on internal\r\nstructural and organisational matters. He refers, inter alia, to the\r\nstatus, roles and duties of the Convening Officer, the Judge Advocate\r\nand the Judge Advocate General's office. The applicant also refers to\r\nthe relationship of the members of the court-martial, the Convening\r\nOfficer and the Reviewing Authorities to the prosecuting authority. He\r\npoints to the lack of civilian judicial members of the court-martial,\r\nthe absence of guarantees against outside pressures and the ad hoc\r\nnature of the appointment of the members of the court-martial. The\r\napplicant submits that, inter alia, the above factors demonstrate a\r\nlack, or at least a perceived lack, of independence and impartiality\r\nparticularly when, as in his case, an important policy issue in respect\r\nof Post Traumatic Stress Disorder arose for consideration.\r\n\r\n      The Government argue that the independence and impartiality of\r\nthese bodies is demonstrated by a number of factors. The Government\r\npoint out, inter alia, that the members of the court-martial take an\r\noath of independence and impartiality, that none of those members is\r\nsubject to instruction by a higher authority, that the Convening\r\nOfficer is not the prosecuting authority, that the Judge Advocate and\r\nthe advisers in the Judge Advocate General's office are civilians,\r\nexperienced members of the legal profession and totally independent of\r\nthe armed forces, and that an individual member of a court-martial\r\ncannot be removed by a superior officer once appointed.\r\n\r\n      The Government also argue that the Judge Advocate must satisfy\r\nhimself that none of the members of the court-martial knows the accused\r\nor has heard anything about the charges. In the present case the\r\napplicant did not object to the constitution of the court-martial and\r\nin any event, according to the Government, it does not follow from the\r\nfact that the members of the court-martial were all subordinate in rank\r\nto the Convening Officer (having no direct prior relationship with that\r\nOfficer) that they lacked independence or impartiality.\r\n\r\n      In addition, the Government submit that military personnel are\r\nbest suited to try a member of the armed forces under military law in\r\nrespect of offences committed against fellow soldiers on military\r\npremises when on a tour of duty. The Government argue that the ad hoc\r\nconvening of a court-martial for each case is in fact an enhancement\r\nof the protections available to an accused as the members are not\r\nserving a term of office which they may wish to be renewed.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, the applicant complains that the court-martial hearing\r\nand the post-hearing reviews were neither fair nor public.\r\n\r\n      In this respect the applicant points mainly to the lack of\r\nreasons for the decisions of the court-martial, the Confirming Officer\r\nand the Reviewing Authorities, the privacy surrounding the advice given\r\nby the Judge Advocate and the Judge Advocate General's office, together\r\nwith the administrative and private nature of the post-hearing reviews.\r\nHe argues that, inter alia, these factors meant that he was neither\r\nable to establish upon what basis the relevant bodies made their\r\ndecisions nor, therefore, effectively able to participate in any of the\r\npost-hearing reviews and the judicial review proceedings.\r\n\r\n      The applicant also points, in this respect, to an inequality of\r\narms between the prosecution and the defence due to the Convening\r\nOfficer's effective control of the court-martial hearing through the\r\nprosecuting officer, and to the conduct of the prosecuting officer, the\r\nJudge Advocate and the Convening Officer (the latter of whom allegedly\r\nfailed to ensure the attendance of a vital witness) in respect of that\r\nhearing. These factors, the applicant submits, also contributed to the\r\noverall unfairness of the proceedings against him. He also takes issue\r\nwith the limited sentencing regime available and the reasonableness of\r\nthe decisions reached in his case.\r\n\r\n      The Government argue, inter alia, that the procedural guarantees\r\naccorded to the applicant before the court-martial (including the right\r\nto call and cross-examine witnesses and to representation) and the\r\nduties of the Judge Advocate towards the applicant during the court-\r\nmartial hearing, ensured that the proceedings, taken as a whole, were\r\nfair. The Government also submit that, in light of the importance of\r\ndiscipline in the armed forces and in view of the seriousness of the\r\ncharges, the reasons for the sentence were obvious.\r\n\r\n      In addition, the Government dispute that the Convening Officer\r\ncontrolled the proceedings through the prosecuting officer, and point\r\nout that the applicant was represented by an experienced lawyer. The\r\nGovernment also refer to the fact that the conduct of the Judge\r\nAdvocate was considered and found acceptable by the Divisional Court,\r\nand submit that the prosecuting officer did all that was possible to\r\nensure the attendance of the relevant witness, including issuing a\r\nwitness summons. The applicant has, according to the Government, no\r\nright to an appeal under the Convention and, in any event, the post-\r\nhearing reviews are not, according to the Government, designed to be\r\nfull appeals, but rather further pleas in mitigation.\r\n\r\n      In respect of the sentencing regime, the Government submit that\r\nthe question of whether the accused is tried by the civilian or\r\nmilitary authorities is a decision for the civilian authorities, though\r\nby agreement the military authorities do not have to report certain\r\nmatters to the civilian authorities. A wider sentencing regime is not\r\npossible due to the lack of facilities in the armed forces and to the\r\nfact that some sentences would be inappropriate to pass upon a serving\r\nmember of the armed forces and inconsistent with his duties. The\r\nGovernment further submit that the decision of the court-martial was\r\nreasonable in view of, inter alia, the importance of discipline in army\r\nlife, the context in which the offences were committed and the\r\nseriousness of the charges.\r\n\r\n      The Government therefore conclude that all of the applicant's\r\ncomplaints under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention should\r\nbe deemed manifestly ill-founded, or that the case does not disclose\r\na violation of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds, in light of the parties' submissions, that\r\nthe applicant's complaints under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the\r\nConvention raise serious and complex issues of fact and law which\r\nrequire determination on their merits. It follows that the application\r\ncannot be dismissed as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning\r\nof Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. No other ground\r\nfor declaring it inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission unanimously\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n      merits of the case.\r\n",

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\nHaving regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the application introduced on 30 August 1990 by Mohamed Al FAYED, Ali FAYED and Salah FAYED and the House of Fraser Holdings plc against the United Kingdom and registered on 30 August 1990 under file No. 17101/90;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to:\r\n\r\n-\treports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n-\tthe Government's written observations of 10 June 1991 to which the applicants replied on 15 November 1991;\r\n\r\n-\tthe parties' oral submissions at the hearing on 15 May 1992;\r\n\r\nHaving deliberated;\r\n\r\nDecides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\nThe first three applicants are Egyptian citizens, born in 1933, 1943 and 1939 respectively. They are brothers and businessmen. The fourth applicant is a limited public company which is owned by the brothers. The applicants are represented before the Commission by Messrs. Herbert Smith, Solicitors, London.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the present case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows:\r\n\r\nA.\tThe particular circumstances of the case\r\n \r\n\r\nThe application arises out of an investigation into the affairs of the fourth applicant by Inspectors appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985, and the publication of the Inspectors' report in its entirety by the respondent Government.\r\n\r\nIn March 1985, the first three applicants acquired ownership of House of Fraser plc (HOF). HOF was then and is now one of the largest groups of department stores in Europe and includes one particularly well-known London store, Harrods. The brothers acquired ownership of HOF through the fourth applicant, the House of Fraser Holdings plc (HOFH), which at all material times was owned by the brothers. It had previously been known as the Al Fayed Investment Trust (UK) Limited and assumed its present name in December 1985.\r\n\r\nPrior to the HOF takeover, in or about early November 1984, on professional advice, the brothers appointed Broad Street Associates to act as their public relations advisers and, with their assistance, the brothers and their advisers led the press to receive and present a positive picture of their origins, wealth, business interests and resources. Upon the basis of this picture, which they had a part in painting, they enjoyed, for a time, an esteem or reputation which was highly valuable to them. Between 2 and 10 November 1984 the first applicant gave separate interviews to The Observer, The Sunday Telegraph and The Daily Mail. The applicants' public relations consultants played a part in making the arrangements. A further interview, involving the brothers, arranged by the consultants, took place on 10 March 1985. In these interviews the brothers described a wealthy, distinguished and established family background. They gave a similar picture to Mr. MacArthur of their merchant bankers Kleinwort Benson. Mr. MacArthur accepted it and, acting on their behalf, conveyed that picture by a press release in November 1984 and in a television interview in early March 1985. There were other press interviews about the family background for which the applicants were responsible. They thus took active steps to promote their own reputations in the public domain. The acceptance of the brothers by the City of London and by Government was later considered to be crucial to an understanding of the events surrounding their takeover of HOF.\r\n\r\nThe takeover was vigorously but unsuccessfully opposed by Lonrho plc (Lonrho) and, in particular, its Chief Executive, Mr. Rowland, a former business associate, turned rival, of the applicants. In 1984 Lonrho had sold its near 30 % share in HOF to the applicants, but when their directors were obliged to resign from HOF's Board and the applicants bid to take over HOF completely, relations between Lonrho and the applicants deteriorated. Lonrho proceeded to launch an acrimonious campaign against the applicants. In opposing the applicants' bid for HOF, Lonrho had made submissions to Ministers\r\n\r\nconcerning unfair competition and the undesirability of HOF falling into foreign hands. It was alleged that the applicants were fraudulently claiming that the funds for the acquisition were theirs personally. Lonrho alleged that the brothers were lying about their money and themselves and that they should not be permitted to acquire HOF without a thorough inquiry. However, the applicants' bid was cleared and accepted, but Lonrho single-mindedly campaigned on through the media and other publications, and in particular through its newspaper, The Observer. The applicants instituted three libel actions against The Observer in 1985 and 1986 for articles written about them.\r\n\r\nIn March 1987 Lonrho commenced legal proceedings against the applicants and their bankers alleging wrongful interference with business, conspiracy and negligence in connection with HOFH's acquisition of HOF. These proceedings are to date apparently still pending. Lonrho was refused leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State's refusal to refer the applicants' acquisition of HOF to the Monopolies\r\n \r\nand Mergers Commission (MMC).\r\n\r\nAfter two years of powerful and unrelenting pressure by Lonrho upon the United Kingdom Government, on 9 April 1987, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry appointed two Inspectors to investigate the affairs of HOFH and, in particular, the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of shares in HOF in 1984 and 1985. The appointment of the Inspectors was made by the Secretary of State under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 (the 1985 Act).\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors stated that their investigation was an unusual one and that in order to establish what had occurred during the takeover they had been obliged to make findings on contested issues of fact.\r\n\r\nThe principal questions which they addressed when investigating the affairs of HOFH were as follows:\r\n \r\n\r\n\"(i)\r\n \r\n\r\nWere the Fayeds who they said they were, and if not\r\n\r\nwho were they?\r\n \r\n\r\n(ii)\tDid they acquire HOF with their own unencumbered funds?\r\n\r\n(iii)\tDid they deliberately mislead, whether directly\r\nor indirectly, those who represented them to the\r\nauthorities and the public?\r\n\r\n(iv)\tIf so, did they seek to frustrate those who tried to establish the true facts, and if so how?\r\n\r\n(v)\tWhat steps did the Board of HOF and its advisers and the Fayeds' financial and legal advisers take before they gave the comfort that they appeared to give to those who relied on their words or actions?\r\n\r\n(vi)\tWere the authorities - the officials of the OFT (Office of Fair Trading) and the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) and, eventually, Ministers - or the public misled about the Fayeds? If so, how and why?\"\r\n\r\n(The Inspectors' report, para. 1.11).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors also stated that, throughout their investigation, they were not concerned solely with simple questions relating to the direct control of the purchase money which was used to buy HOF. They were concerned about the statements which the applicants made, or which they allowed others to make on their behalf, which had the effect of influencing people to act favourably towards them.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the investigation, the Inspectors identified matters upon which they wished to receive evidence. If any uncertainty or issue arose in relation to the provision of such evidence, these\r\n\r\nwere discussed in the course of meetings or through correspondence between the Inspectors' staff and the applicants' solicitors. Thereafter, information was provided to the Inspectors by way of memoranda, together with copy documentation. In addition, the Inspectors received oral evidence by interviewing witnesses. They interviewed Mohamed and Ali Fayed on 14 October 1987 and again on\r\n\r\n8 and 9 March 1988. All proceedings were conducted in private. There was no opportunity for the applicants to confront or to cross-examine witnesses, it being well-established as a matter of English law that\r\n\r\nthe Inspectors were not obliged to afford such an opportunity to anyone.\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was agreed between the Inspectors and the applicants that, having assimilated the factual information supplied, the Inspectors would notify the applicants of the provisional conclusions they had reached and the material upon which they had relied in reaching such conclusions. The Inspectors would then consider such submissions as the applicants might make in respect of these conclusions.\r\n\r\nRespect for personal privacy was a matter of particular concern to the brothers. It was not in dispute that they had occupied a position as trusted and confidential advisers to Heads of State. This fact made respect for the privacy of their affairs especially important. They claimed that loss of confidence in their ability to maintain privacy would put in jeopardy their relationships, as businessmen and confidential advisers, with Heads of State and other important and influential individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors' approach to matters of privacy and confidentiality is summed up at paragraphs 26.44 - 26.45 of their subsequent report as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We were aware of the Fayeds' concerns about privacy.\r\nHowever, if private people incorporate a company, in\r\nwhich they become directors, and which makes public\r\nrepresentations about their affairs, Inspectors who\r\nare appointed to investigate the truth of those\r\nrepresentations must balance their concern to preserve\r\nthe directors' privacy as far as practicable (in\r\nChapter 12 for instance we have deliberately refrained\r\nfrom making detailed findings in respect of many of\r\nthe Fayeds' private companies whose accounts we have\r\nseen) against their duty to do the job which they\r\nwere appointed to perform.\r\n\r\nIf the Fayeds had chosen to say nothing this might\r\nhave created evidential difficulties for us.\tBut\r\nbecause they wished us to make findings in their\r\nfavour they brought witnesses to see us ...\r\nand gave us evidence about their private affairs\r\nwhich it was then our duty to test.\"\r\n\r\nAt the start of the investigation the brothers expressly accepted that the Inspectors were entitled to enquire into the accuracy of statements which had been made by them or on their behalf. These were the statements at the heart of the enquiry. Only at the very end of\r\n\r\nthe enquiry did they alter that stance and challenge the Inspectors' entitlement to enquire into certain aspects of their private life. The Inspectors rejected the challenge and gave their reasons for so doing. The Inspectors were entitled to seek confidential information from third parties, but before doing so they gave the brothers an opportunity to satisfy them as to the accuracy of the statements \"in whatever manner was least obtrusive to their privacy\" (report paras.\r\n\r\n16.2.5 and 16.6.2). The law did not permit them to compel the brothers to produce personal bank statements (which would have gone far to confirm or refute the accuracy of the statements) nor, save to a very limited extent, did the brothers consent to such production. The Inspectors considered that the brothers were in breach of their duty\r\n\r\nto give all the assistance which they were reasonably required to give. The Government stated that the Inspectors were entitled to certify to a court that the brothers were refusing to answer questions, produce documents or to give such assistance as they required (section 436 of the 1985 Act). The court could then have taken steps to sanction the brothers if, after hearing evidence, it was satisfied that they were\r\n\r\nin breach of their duty. The Inspectors, however, were of the opinion that they could complete their task without the need to resort to such\r\n\r\na serious measure and chose to pursue the matter without making such a certificate.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn October 1987 and thereafter Lonrho publicly criticised the conduct of the investigation by the Inspectors and sought an additional two month period in which to assemble and submit evidence to them. Through its lawyers Lonrho submitted that the rules of natural justice required the Inspectors to allow Lonrho access to the information the Inspectors had received from the applicants because Lonrho's commercial reputation would suffer if the Inspectors dismissed the complaints\r\n\r\nwhich it had made so publicly. The Inspectors dismissed Lonrho's application for access to the applicants' evidence, but permitted Lonrho to have a longer period in which to adduce evidence to them, relating primarily to the personal background of the brothers and their family. The applicants' solicitors protested to the Inspectors vigorously about this decision. The Inspectors accepted that Lonrho and its directors had pursued their ends in a remarkably single-minded manner.\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors' provisional conclusions were made available to the applicants on 12 April 1988 and, after much correspondence, it was agreed that the applicants could make final submissions to the Inspectors by 15 July 1988. On 23 July 1988, the Inspectors delivered their Report to the Secretary of State. The Inspectors concluded that the applicants had dishonestly misrepresented their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to the Secretary\r\n\r\nof State, the OFT, the Press, the HOF Board and HOF shareholders and their own advisers; that during the course of their investigations, the\r\n\r\n\r\nInspectors had received evidence from the applicants, under solemn affirmation and in written memoranda, which was false and which the applicants knew to be false; in addition, that the applicants had produced a set of documents they knew to be false; that this evidence related mainly, but not exclusively, to their background, their past business activities and the way in which they came to be in control of enormous funds in the Autumn of 1984 and the Spring of 1985. The Inspectors were satisfied that the main thrust of Lonrho's attack on the applicants was well founded on a sound basis of substantiated fact (report para. 1.20). However, the Inspectors did not reject the entirety of the applicants' evidence and praised part of their work. Thus the report included, for example, findings that \"... the departure of the Lonrho directors and their replacement by the Fayeds brought harmony to a board where previously discord had existed\" (report para. 6.6.9); and that \"the Fayeds' considerable ability to identify assets with a potential for capital appreciation has undoubtedly been an important element in their business success\" (report para. 12.6.10).\r\n\r\nIn relation to the valuation of the brothers' banking interests the Inspectors rejected the evidence of an Observer journalist and accepted the figure which they advanced. In the final chapter of the report the Inspectors make complimentary findings of fact and express favourable opinions about HOFH. In the concluding paragraph the Inspectors made it clear that their concerns \"have been principally centred on the specific matters we were appointed to investigate, and not on anything which has occurred since March 1985\". They regarded the management of HOF since its acquisition as, subject to certain reservations, \"law-abiding, proper and regular\".\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State passed the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (the SFO). On 29 September 1988, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) issued a press release stating that publication of the report would be delayed until the SFO had completed its investigations. After consideration of the report and the accompanying evidence, the Director of the SFO and the DPP jointly referred the matter to the Metropolitan Police on 24 November 1988 and asked for necessary inquiries to be carried out. In the summer of 1988, the Secretary of State also sent copies of the report to the Bank of England, the\r\n \r\nTakeover Panel, the Inland Revenue, the OFT and the MMC.\r\n\r\nIn early November 1988, Lonrho sought judicial review of the Director General of Fair Trading's failure to advise the Secretary of State with regard to a possible referral to the MMC. This application was withdrawn when the Director General subsequently tendered his advice to the Secretary of State. On 9 November 1988, the Secretary of State announced that, consistent with the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading, he had decided against the referral of HOFH's acquisition of HOF to the MMC, even though the report did disclose new material facts. Also in November 1988, Lonrho made an unsuccessful application for judicial review of the Secretary of State's decisions\r\n\r\n(i)\tnot to publish the report immediately and (ii) not to refer the acquisition to the MMC in the light of the report. On 30 March 1989, the day of Lonrho's Annual General Meeting, The Observer newspaper published a 16 page special midweek edition devoted solely to extracts from and comments on a leaked copy of the report. On the same day, Lonrho posted between 2,000 and 3,000 copies of the special edition to persons named on a mailing list to whom Lonrho had been regularly sending propaganda literature hostile to the applicants. The High Court immediately granted injunctions, on the applications of the\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary of State and HOFH, restraining any further disclosure of the report or its contents. On 10 April 1989, before Lonrho's appeal in its unsuccessful judicial review application was before the House of Lords, Lord Keith of Kinkel raised the question whether the publication of the special edition and its posting to, inter alia, four members of\r\n\r\nthe House of Lords who were due to hear Lonrho's appeal, was a contempt of court by Lonrho, Mr. Rowland or the editor of The Observer. Subsequently, the House of Lords held (<1989> 3 WLR 535) that the publication of the special edition did not in the circumstances create any risk that the course of justice in the appellate proceedings\r\n\r\nchallenging the lawfulness of the Secretary of State's decision to\r\ndefer the publication of the report would be impeded or prejudiced, and\r\nthey dismissed the contempt proceedings.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of an interview broadcast on BBC Radio 4's news programme, Today, on 4 April 1989, the Secretary of State stated, prior to its publication, that the Inspectors' report \"clearly disclosed wrongdoing\". This gave rise to substantial press reports.\r\n\r\nOn 1 March 1990, the Director of the SFO and the DPP announced that their inquiries into the matter were complete and that they would\r\nnot be taking further action. They had carefully considered the report and the accompanying evidence. In a joint statement issued on that date they said:\r\n\r\n\"The directors are now satisfied that all lines of enquiry\r\nhave been pursued and that the evidence available is\r\ninsufficient to afford a realistic prospect of conviction\r\nfor any criminal offence relating to any matter of\r\n\r\nsubstance raised in the report.\"\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General expressed himself satisfied that the conclusion reached by the two directors was the correct one on the basis of the admissible and available evidence. On 12 March 1990, he stated to the House of Commons, in reply to a question (Hansard, House of Commons, 12 March 1990, column 14):\r\n\r\n\"Whereas it was open to the inspectors to take account\r\nof hearsay evidence if they thought that it was reliable\r\n\r\n-\tand of course it was open to them to reach the conclusion that they did - it would not have been open to a jury in a criminal case to convict upon evidence\r\n\r\nof the same character.   The inspectors are entitled to take\r\n \r\naccount of evidence covering a wider scope than that\r\navailable in criminal proceedings in an English court ...\r\n... Inquiries were pursued in every part of the world\r\nindicated by the inspectors' report, but the <Director\r\nof the SFO and the DPP> had to conclude, as they said\r\nin their joint statement issued on 1 March, that there\r\nwas insufficient evidence available for use in an English\r\ncourt in English criminal proceedings on any matter of\r\nsubstance raised in the inspectors' report to warrant\r\nthe bringing of criminal proceedings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso on 1 March 1990, the Secretary of State announced his intention to publish the report on 7 March 1990. It is general policy to publish reports on public companies. (The fourth applicant, HOFH, is a public company.) In this particular case the Government considered that there were specific grounds of general public interest justifying publication:\r\n\r\nThere had been a complex and lengthy investigation, and the\r\npublic were entitled to learn the result of that investigation\r\nunless there were compelling reasons why they should not.\tThere\r\nwere important lessons to be learnt by those involved in\r\ntakeovers from studying the report.\tThese were categorised under\r\nsix headings as:\t(1) the demarcation of responsibility between\r\nthe merchant bank and the solicitor,\t(2) knowledge of one's\r\n\r\nclient,\t(3) appropriate procedures for advisers in relation to\r\ntaking on clients, taking up references, accepting and verifying\r\nmaterial from other advisers, and accepting instructions from\r\n\r\nclients, (4) relationships with the media, (5) relationships with the regulatory authorities, and (6) loopholes in the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. The report contained a recommendation that certain features of part XIV of the 1985 Act (which deals with the investigation of companies and their affairs) deserved to be reconsidered in the light of difficulties encountered by the inspectors (report para. 1.25). (Changes were later incorporated in the Companies Act 1989.) It was appropriate to acknowledge that the Secretary of State, the OFT, the DTI, certain journalists and sections of the press, the Board\r\n\r\nof HOF, the regulatory authorities, and the applicants' professional advisers had been misled by the applicants. Lonrho considered that its interests and reputation had been seriously and adversely affected by the preparedness of the Secretary of State to allow the HOFH bid to go forward in March 1985 without a reference to the MMC. Lonrho would have had a legitimate grievance if the explanation for this was suppressed without compelling reasons. There was a need to dispel continuing speculation as to the events which had given rise to the investigation. Rumours and speculation were rife. Publication of the report would provide employees and creditors with information concerning the way in which HOF and Harrods had been run and might be expected to be run in future. (The Inspectors were largely prepared to accept the sincerity of the brothers' assurances for the future.) The brothers had been prepared before the Inspectors to attempt to discredit Lonrho,\r\n\r\nMr. Rowland, The Observer, its editor and others. It was deemed to be in the public interest to publicise both the fact that\r\n\r\nthese attempts had been made and the conclusion of the Inspectors that they were ill-founded.\r\n \r\nOn 2 March 1990, the applicants were provided with pre-publication copies of the report in confidence, in order to enable them to consider their position. Throughout the period from 26 July 1988 to 7 March 1990 the possibility of applying for judicial review to prevent publication was kept under review by the applicants and their advisers, but the unanimous view at all stages was that such proceedings were almost inevitably bound to fail and, accordingly, they were not commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 7 March 1990, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry stated to the House of Commons (Hansard, House of Commons, 7 March 1990, column 873):\r\n\r\n\"I should explain to the House that in this matter I have\r\nthree main responsibilities as Secretary of State: first,\r\n\r\nto decide whether to publish the report. This I have now done as soon as possible after I was informed by the prosecution authorities that they had withdrawn their objection to publication. Second, I had to consider whether to apply to the court to disqualify any director under section 8 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. I have concluded that it would not be in the public interest to do so. Anyone who reads the report can decide for themselves\r\n\r\nwhat they think of the conduct of those involved.\r\nThird, I also have responsibility for decisions on\r\nwhether to refer mergers to the Monopolies and Mergers\r\nCommission.\tThat responsibility was fully discharged\r\nby my predecessor.\tHe had six months from July 1988 in\r\n\r\nwhich to consider the findings of the inspectors' report\r\nand to decide whether to refer the matter.\tHe concluded\r\nin November 1988 that a reference to the MMC would not\r\nbe appropriate ...\r\nNo other matters require action from me.\tI have passed\r\nthe report to all those authorities concerned with\r\nenforcement and regulation so that they may consider\r\nwhether to take action under their various powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State considered that the publication of the report and the ensuing publicity would enable people who might have dealings with the applicants in their capacity as directors to judge whether their interests were likely to be at risk from the type of conduct described in the report. The Secretary of State also publicly expressed his own view that the Inspectors' findings were correct. He stated (Select Committee Report, Annex 6, page 183, paras. 938, 939, 940A):\r\n\r\n\"... the allegations in the report have not been substantiated\r\nin a court of law.\tWe can all take our view about them and\r\n\r\nI think that the balance of probability is extremely strongly\r\nthat they are accurate, but there is no proof of this.\r\n...\r\nI am not required to say that every fact and opinion in the\r\nreport is true.\tThese were outside inspectors who were\r\nappointed to look into these matters, and they published\r\ntheir report.\tI have no means of checking it word for\r\nword.\tI myself and I think most people are inclined to\r\nbelieve that the events revealed are correct, but we have\r\nno proof - that is all I am saying.\r\n...\r\n<Question:>\tIt appears that <the applicants> even told\r\na succession of lies to the inspectors themselves, who\r\n\r\nwere then investigating the lies they had already told.\r\n \r\nIs that right?\r\n<Secretary of State:>\tIt so appears.\"\r\n\r\nOn 28 March 1990, in the course of a debate in the House of Lords, the Minister of State for Trade and Industry stated (Hansard, House of Lords, 28 March 1990, columns 946-7):\r\n\r\n\"Although the inspectors concluded that the Fayeds lied\r\nto the competition authorities at the time of the merger\r\n\r\n-\tI have no reason to believe that they were wrong, but it is for individuals to make up their own minds once they have read the report - the inspectors did not criticise the Fayeds for the way they were running the House of Fraser which they already owned and which cannot be taken away from them. In these circumstances, <the Secretary of State> considered that publication\r\n\r\nof the report, which would allow people to judge for themselves whether they wished to do business with the Fayeds, would be a severe blow to their reputation, as indeed I think it has proved.\"\r\n\r\nThe report and its findings were widely reported on television, radio and in the national press. The first three applicants claimed that it very seriously damaged their personal and commercial reputations as the Minister had predicted. They also felt compelled\r\nto abandon their libel actions against The Observer newspaper and paid the latter's £500,000 legal costs. One month after the publication of the report the Bank of England served notice of restrictions on Harrods Bank Ltd in relation to the brothers' positions within that company.\r\n\r\nA Parliamentary Select Committee considered that the Secretary of State had not taken sufficient action against the applicants. Lonrho persisted with its attacks. In May 1990 it applied for judicial review\r\n\r\nof the Secretary of State's refusal to apply to the High Court for an order disqualifying the first three applicants as directors. These proceedings are apparently still pending.\r\n\r\nB.\tThe relevant domestic law and practice The scope of a section 432 (2) investigation\r\n\r\nThe investigation of HOFH was conducted under section 432 (2) of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of shares in HOF in 1984 and 1985. Section 432 (2) empowers the Secretary of State to appoint Inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and to report on them in such manner as he directs if it appears to him that there are circumstances suggesting wrongdoing, within the categories of wrongdoing defined in sub-sections 432 (2) (a) to (d). Section 432 (2) defines those categories of wrongdoing as follows:\r\n\r\n\"(a) that the company's affairs are being or have been\r\nconducted with intent to defraud its creditors or\r\n\r\nthe creditors of any other person, or otherwise\r\nfor a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a\r\nmanner which is unfairly prejudicial to some part\r\nof its members, or\r\n\r\n(b)\tthat any actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n(c)\tthat persons concerned with the company's formation or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards it or towards its members, or\r\n\r\n(d)\tthat the company's members have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State does not generally disclose to the company concerned the reasons for the appointment of Inspectors to investigate its affairs. The Secretary of State is under no statutory obligation\r\nto do so (Norwest Holst Limited v. Secretary of State <1978> 3 WLR 73 (CA)). In this case, when requested by the House of Lords to do so in the course of Lonrho's judicial review applications, the Government's counsel stated that the Secretary of State had acted under section 432 (2) (a) in appointing the Inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe basis for a section 432 (2) investigation\r\n\r\nBefore appointing Inspectors, it must appear to the Secretary of State that there are circumstances suggesting one or more of the types of wrongdoing described in section 432 (2) (a) to (d). The Secretary of State is not required to limit the powers of investigation of the Inspectors to the matters set forth in section 432 (2), and Inspectors are not obliged, before they report, to consider whether every matter on which they report can properly be described as falling within section 432 (2), and to exclude it if it cannot (the Inspectors' report in this case, para. 26.18).\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors' powers to obtain information\r\n\r\nSection 434 confers wide powers upon the Inspectors to obtain\r\ninformation, if necessary by compulsion, from officers and agents of\r\nthe company whose affairs are being investigated.\tAn answer given by\r\na person to a question put to him in exercise of powers conferred by\r\nsection 434 may be used in evidence against him (section 434 (5)).\tBy\r\nvirtue of section 436, obstruction of the Inspectors is treated as a\r\ncontempt of court, and is therefore punishable by imprisonment or fine.\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors' duty to act fairly\r\n\r\nThe Inspectors have a duty to act fairly and to give anyone whom they propose to condemn or criticise in their report a fair opportunity\r\nto answer what is alleged against them (In re Pergamon Press Ltd <1971> 1 Ch. 388 (CA)). However, the Inspectors are not a court of law; they are masters of their own procedure and are under no duty to act judicially (ibid., pp. 399-400 per Lord Denning M.R.; pp. 406-07 per Buckley L.J.). Except for the duty to act fairly, Inspectors are not subject to any set rules or procedures and are free to act at their own discretion. There is no right for a person who is at risk of being condemned by the Inspectors to cross-examine witnesses (ibid., p. 400B per Lord Denning M.R.). It is not necessary for the Inspectors to put their tentative conclusions to the witnesses in order to give them a chance to refute them. It is sufficient in law for the Inspectors to\r\n\r\nput to the witnesses what has been said against them by other persons or in documents to enable them to deal with those criticisms in the course of the investigation (Maxwell v. Department of Trade and Industry <1974> 1 Q.B. 523 (CA)).\r\n\r\n\r\nPublication of the report of the investigation\r\n \r\nThe Secretary of State is empowered by section 437 (3) (c) to decide whether or not to print and publish the Inspectors' report. Although he has a very wide discretion in deciding whether or not to publish the whole report, he is precluded by section 437 (3) (c) from deciding to publish only parts or a synopsis of it. Publication may, however, be deferred if there is a possibility that criminal proceedings may be taken, in order to avoid the possibility of prejudice to such proceedings.\r\n\r\nPolicy concerning the publication of Inspectors' reports\r\ngenerally\r\n\r\nThe question of whether an Inspector's report should be published is considered in each case on its merits. The DTI's general policy is\r\nto publish reports on public companies wherever possible, as being matters of public interest. The fourth applicant, HOFH, is a public company.\r\n\r\nCompanies are in a privileged legal position resulting in particular from the limited liability which their members enjoy. Therefore, in circumstances where the Secretary of State has decided that the affairs of a large public company should be investigated under the provisions of section 432 of the 1985 Act because he is satisfied that the conditions of that section have been met and that the circumstances are of sufficient concern to warrant the substantial cost of an inspection, it is important that the Inspectors' report\r\n\r\nexplaining the underlying facts and the conclusions that they draw from them should be made public unless there are overriding reasons to the contrary.\r\n\r\nPrivilege from defamation proceedings\r\n\r\nIn re Pergamon Press Ltd (<1971> Ch. 388 (CA)), at page 400G, Lord Denning M.R. stated that Inspectors\r\n\r\n\"should make their report with courage and frankness,\r\nkeeping nothing back.\tThe public interest demands it.\r\nThey need have no fear because their report, so far as\r\nI can judge, is protected by an absolute privilege: see\r\nHome v. Bentinck (1820) 2 Brod. & Bing. 130, 162, per\r\nLord Ellenborough, and Chatterton v. Secretary of State\r\nfor India in Council <1895> 2 Q.B. 189, 191, per Lord\r\nEsher M.R.\"\r\n\r\nEven if, contrary to Lord Denning's observation, the Inspectors' report is subject to a qualified rather than an absolute privilege, neither the Inspectors nor the Secretary of State could be successfully sued for defamation in publishing the report, except upon proof of express malice (i.e., the desire to injure as the dominant motive for\r\n\r\nthe defamatory publication: see Horrocks v. Lowe <1975> A.C. 135 (HL), at page 149 per Lord Diplock).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial review\r\n\r\nThe grounds on which administrative action (such as the Secretary of State's decision to publish the report) is subject to judicial\r\n\r\ncontrol are the three traditional grounds of judicial review described by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (<1985> AC 375 (HL)), at pages 410-11. These are\r\n \r\nillegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety.\t\"Illegality\"\r\n\r\nmeans that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. \"Irrationality\" applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be arrived at could have arrived at it. \"Procedural impropriety\" covers failure to act\r\n\r\nwith procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State had a duty to exercise his discretion whether to publish the Inspectors' report by reference to relevant and not irrelevant considerations, and in a manner which was not unreasonable in the sense of the Wednesbury principles (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation (1948) 1 KB 223 (CA)). \"Irrationality\" or \"Wednesbury unreasonableness\" is a narrowly restricted ground of judicial review of an administrative decision.\r\n\r\n\"Where the existence or non-existence of a fact is left to the judgment and discretion of a public body and that fact involves a broad spectrum ranging from the obvious to the debatable to the just conceivable, it is the duty of the court to leave the decision of fact to the public\r\nbody to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision-making power save in a case where it is obvious that the public body, consciously or unconsciously, are acting perversely\" (per Lord Brightman, in R v. Hillingdon L.B.C., ex parte Puhlhofer <1986> A.C. 484 (HL), at page 528).\r\n\r\nNo duty on the Secretary of State to give reasons for his\r\ndecision to publish\r\n\r\nThere is no general duty on a public body to give reasons as a\r\nmatter of administrative fairness (R v. Civil Service Appeal Board, ex\r\nparte Cunningham, Times Law Report, 13 June 1990).\tThus, there was no\r\n\r\nduty on the Secretary of State to give reasons for his refusal to make\r\n\r\na reference to the MMC of HOFH's bid for HOF (R v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, ex parte Lonrho, <1989> 1 WLR 525, per Lord Keith of Kinkel at page 539H). Similarly, there is no duty on the Secretary of State to give reasons for his decision to publish the report. The absence of any duty to give reasons for the decisions of public authorities limits the scope of judicial review.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Bank of England, and safeguards for persons affected by their exercise\r\n\r\nThe regulatory duties and functions of the Bank of England and the controls placed upon them are contained in the Banking Act 1987. The powers of the Bank of England include the power to grant or refuse to institutions authorisation to carry on a deposit-taking business (section 9). The minimum criteria for authorisation of an institution include a requirement that every director, manager and executive shareholder and indirect controller of the institution is a fit and proper person to hold his position (schedule 3 para. 1(1)). In\r\n\r\n\r\ndetermining whether a person is fit and proper, regard must be had,\r\ninter alia, to his probity (ibid. para. 1(2)) and regard may be had to\r\nany evidence that he has, inter alia, engaged in any business practices\r\nappearing to the Bank to be deceitful, oppressive or otherwise improper\r\n(whether unlawful or not) or which otherwise reflect discredit on his\r\nmethod of conducting business (ibid. para. 1(3)(c)).\tThe Bank may\r\nrevoke (section 11) or restrict (section 12) the authorisation of an\r\n\r\ninstitution if, inter alia, the minimum criteria for authorisation are not met by the institution. A party aggrieved (including, in the case of a revocation or restriction, the individual concerned) by any decision of the Bank may appeal to a tribunal consisting of an experienced lawyer and two persons with experience in accountancy and\r\n \r\nbanking respectively (section 28). The tribunal has power to confirm or reverse the decision complained of (section 29(2)) and has to determine whether the Bank's finding of lack of probity was not justified by the evidence on which it was based. There are further rights of appeal on a point of law to the High Court, and, with leave, to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords (section 31).\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\nThe applicants complain that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report has\r\n\r\n(a)\tdetermined their civil right to honour and reputation, in breach of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n(b)\tdetermined criminal charges against them, in breach of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n(c)\tviolated the presumption of innocence, in breach of Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n(d)\tarbitrarily and unnecessarily interfered with their honour and reputation, protected as part of their right to respect for private life, in breach of Article 8 of the Convention;\r\n\r\n(e)\tarbitrarily and unnecessarily interfered with the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe applicants further complain that, in breach of Article 13 of the Convention, there are no effective remedies before the national authorities of the United Kingdom for any of the above Convention claims.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\nThe application was introduced on 30 August 1990 and registered on the same day.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary examination of the case by the Rapporteur, the Commission considered the admissibility of the application on\r\n7 December 1990. It decided, pursuant to Rule 48 para. 2 (b) of the Rules of Procedure, to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and to invite the parties to submit their written\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobservations on admissibility and merits. The Government's observations were submitted on 10 June 1991 after three extensions of the time limit fixed for this purpose. The applicants replied on 15 November 1991 after two extensions of the time limit. On\r\n\r\n20 February 1992 the Commission decided to hold a hearing of the parties on the question whether Article 6 para. 1 (civil) of the Convention had been violated. The hearing was held on 15 May 1992. The applicants were represented by Mr. A. Lester QC, Counsel,\r\n\r\nMr. P. Goulding, Counsel, Ms. L. Hutchinson, Solicitor, Messrs. Herbert Smith, and Mr. D. Marvin, Attorney, Washington DC. The Government were represented by their Agent, Mrs. A. Glover, Mr. M. Baker, QC, Counsel, Mr. J. Eadie, Counsel, Mrs. T. Dunstan, Mr. M. Osborne and\r\n\r\nMr. J. Moore, all three of whom were from the Department of Trade and Industry.\r\n \r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.\tThe applicants have complained about the making, contents and publication of the Inspectors' report on the affairs of the fourth applicant, a company. Before dealing with the specific claims, the Commission would first exclude the fourth applicant company from the purview of the application. The essence of the case concerns the criticisms made in the Inspectors' report about the first three applicants and the effects of the report upon their honour and reputation. Even though they own the fourth applicant company no evidence of any criticism of the company or any prejudice to its reputation has been put forward. In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention. It follows that, in respect of the\r\n\r\nfourth applicant company, the application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and this aspect of the case must, therefore, be rejected under Article 27 para. 2\r\n\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention. Reference hereafter to the applicants is a reference to the first three applicants only.\r\n\r\n2.\tTurning to the specific issues, the applicants have complained\r\n\r\nof a denial of effective access to the civil courts in that the Inspectors' report allegedly determined their civil right to honour and reputation, in breach of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations\r\nor of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled\r\nto a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an\r\n\r\nindependent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interest of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission finds that the complaint has two aspects:\r\n\r\na)\tthat the applicants cannot bring a civil claim against the Inspectors or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in order to clear their reputations, allegedly sullied in the report;\r\n\r\nb)\tthat the applicants felt obliged to withdraw libel proceedings against The Observer newspaper because, after the publication of the report, which partly related to matters in issue in those proceedings, a fair hearing would allegedly have been impossible.\r\n\r\nThe applicants have submitted that the publication of the report\r\nresulted in massive adverse publicity in the media, the wholesale\r\ndestruction of their reputations and a general belief in their\r\n\r\ndishonesty and criminal guilt.\tThey have claimed, inter alia, that\r\nthey had no effective safeguards or domestic remedies against this\r\nbecause of the great breadth of the Secretary of State's and the\r\nInspectors' discretionary powers, the restrictive scope of judicial\r\nreview and the impossibility of suing the Inspectors or the Secretary\r\nof State in the civil courts for defamation because they would have had\r\na defence of absolute or qualified privilege.\tThe applicants have\r\ncomplained that the report hopelessly blighted the defamation\r\nproceedings against The Observer, which they withdrew as a result.\r\nOther such proceedings would have been futile.\r\n\r\nThe Government have submitted, inter alia, that the applicants' complaints about the consequences for them of the publication of the report were exaggerated and unsubstantiated. The extensive publicity\r\n \r\nafter the report's publication was ephemeral.\tWhilst it is true that\r\nan action in defamation against these public officials would probably\r\nhave been successfully defended on the ground of privilege, this merely\r\nreflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic\r\nlaw, rather than the right of access to court for determining the\r\napplicants' civil rights under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the\r\nConvention.\tThe Government have contended that the applicants could\r\nhave brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly\r\nproceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for\r\nthem, in respect of the allegedly serious improprieties committed by\r\nthem during Lonrho's acrimonious campaign and, more particularly, in\r\nrespect of the very matters central to the Inspectors' report.\tThe\r\nGovernment have disputed a claim made by the applicants that any jury\r\n\r\ntrial of these issues would have been biased and that they therefore\r\n\r\nhad to withdrew the defamation proceedings against The Observer. They have contended that the report could not be used as evidence in those proceedings. The Government emphasised that the decision of the Secretary of State to publish the report was not a decision directed against the applicants; it was a decision taken in the general public interest, including that of freedom of expression and information, having regard to the overall content of the report.\r\n\r\nThe Commission considers that this part of the application raises a serious question of fact and law which is of such complexity that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits. This aspect of the application cannot, therefore, be regarded as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention, and no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe applicants have next complained that the publication of the Inspectors' report violated the presumption of innocence.\r\n\r\nArticle 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, cited above, guarantees a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges. Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) provides that anyone \"charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law\".\r\n\r\nThe applicants have contended that the Inspectors' report made statements about them which amounted to findings of criminal conduct. However, Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention requires public officials to refrain from declaring or pronouncing that an individual\r\n\r\nis guilty of a criminal offence, where guilt has not been proved by a fair judicial process satisfying the requirements of Article 6\r\n\r\n(Art. 6) (cf. eg. Eur. Court H.R., Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982,\r\n\r\nSeries A No. 49; Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A No. 35; and No. 7986/77, Krause v. Switzerland, Dec. 3.10.78, D.R. 13 p. 73).\r\n\r\nThe Government have submitted, inter alia, that the applicants\r\nwere not persons who had been charged with a criminal offence within\r\nthe meaning of Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the\r\nConvention.\tThe Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nThey had been appointed to investigate and report on the fourth\r\n\r\napplicant's affairs, and, in particular the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser plc (HOF) in 1984 and 1985. Before the Inspectors' report was published it was clearly and publicly stated by the competent authorities that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the applicants. The Inspectors had not made any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants. They considered that the applicants had been dishonest over certain matters, but although dishonesty is reprehensible, it is not a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nThe Commission considers that while the Inspectors' report was being studied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution and\r\n \r\ntherefore, \"charged\", within the meaning of Article 6 para. 2\r\n\r\n(Art. 6-2) of the Convention (cf. the Court's aforementioned Deweer judgment of 27 February 1990, p. 24, para. 46, and the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982, p. 15, para. 30). However, once these officials had issued their public statements on 1 March 1990 that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can, in the Commission's view, be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been \"charged\" any longer. The Inspectors' report was published a week after the DPP and SFO statements. The report made no findings that the applicants had committed any criminal offence, although it was critical of certain aspects of their business affairs. In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the applicants' rights under Article 6 paras.\r\n\r\n1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed. It follows that this aspect of the case is manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe applicants have also complained that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report constituted an unjustified interference with their private lives, contrary to Article 8\r\n(Art. 8) of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1.\tEveryone has the right to respect for his private\r\n... life ...\r\n\r\n2.\tThere shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"\r\n\r\nThe applicants have submitted, inter alia, that English law provides no enforceable right to privacy and no safeguards or limitations on the scope of investigations and reports of the kind seen in this case. The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation. Even if some of the investigations into the applicants' personal background was legitimate, it was unacceptable and wholly disproportionate to inquire into details of the Fayeds' family and business history, followed by the wholesale publication of private information. Any public interest in the conclusions of the Inspectors or the general lessons to be learnt for future commercial practice could have been satisfied by partial publication of the report, but English law did not allow this. The report could only be published in its entirety or not at all. Nor was there any need to protect others' right such as those of Lonrho, by publishing the report in its entirety, as their rights were adequately secured by the ordinary courts.\r\n\r\nThe Government have contended, inter alia, that the report did not interfere with the private lives of the applicants. They stated that the applicants had themselves put their reputation into the public domain before the Inspectors were appointed by the hiring of public relations professionals for this purpose and ensuring media coverage. The inquiries made by the Inspectors were necessary to establish whether the applicants were who they claimed to be - longstanding successful and wealthy businessmen. The Inspectors were aware of the need for privacy and proceeded in whatever manner was least obtrusive to the applicants' privacy (cf. the Inspectors' report paras. 16.2.5\r\n\r\nand 16.6.2, pp. 5-6 above). Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest (pp. 9 and 13 above). Publication was delayed until questions of criminal prosecution had been decided, and sufficient notice was given to the\r\n \r\napplicants at all stages of the contents of the report to enable them to seek judicial review to prevent publication if they saw fit. Publication was also necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country as the report revealed weakness in the system of takeover bids. Publication thereby protected those operating that system in the future. It was also necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, such as those of Lonrho, its shareholders and associates, by confirming that their allegations about the applicants had been well-founded. Moreover the report was well-balanced and did not go further than was necessary for the Inspectors' legitimate purpose. It was not wholly negative about the applicants but gave them credit for their management of HOF (p. 7 above). Even if it had been lawful, it would have been impracticable and possibly misleading to have published only parts of the report, particularly as extracts had been leaked to\r\n\r\nand published by The Observer. In all the circumstances, the Government are of the opinion that the report itself and its publication did not amount to a disproportionate interference with the applicants' right to respect for privacy, and that the publication was well within the Government's margin of appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe Commission finds that the publication of the Inspectors' report with certain of its findings constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention. However, that interference was in accordance with the law, the publication being authorised by section 437 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 1985. It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. Investigations into large scale commercial activities of the present kind and the need to ensure honest dealings fall within the notion of protecting the economic well-being of the country. The interest of the general public in being informed about matters of major public concern can best be served by the publication of the results of Government inquiries. Further elements of general interest are cited above at pp. 9 and 13. The needs of democracy justify transparency in such matters. States enjoy a margin of appreciation in their decision whether to publish reports of the present kind, provided that the decision is not taken arbitrarily or with malice towards the particular individuals involved. The question is one of proportionality or balance between the public and the individual interests.\r\n\r\nThe Commission finds that no elements of arbitrariness are disclosed in the present case. Although it might be fair to say that no investigation into the applicants' affairs would have been started if Lonrho had not launched its campaign against them, the actual investigation by the Inspectors and their report indicate no malice or unreasonableness. As a whole the report may be said to be balanced and thorough; it is not a one-sided condemnation of the applicants and\r\n\r\ngives them credit where credit is due for their business activities. The investigation of certain aspects of their private lives was necessary in view of their claims about their personal backgrounds, which they themselves had vaunted through the media, and as a result of which they had enjoyed a good business reputation for quite some time; hence their success in the HOF takeover bid. In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to\r\n\r\nthe legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\nThe Commission concludes that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe applicants have further complained that there has been an arbitrary and unnecessary interference with the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to\r\n \r\nthe onvention, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful\r\nenjoyment of his possessions.\tNo one shall be deprived of\r\nhis possessions except in the public interest and subject\r\nto the conditions provided for by law and by the general\r\nprinciples of international law.\r\n\r\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way\r\nimpair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems\r\nnecessary to control the use of property in accordance with\r\nthe general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or\r\nother contributions or penalties.\"\r\n\r\nThe applicants have alleged that the publication of the report constituted a measure of control of the use of their property. It seriously damaged their reputation and financial standing and, thereby, harmed their economic interests in the business of HOF. Restrictions were put on their management of Harrods Bank. Although the publication of the report pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public about\r\n\r\nthe acquisition of HOF, it imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicants, which outweighed the general interest.\r\n\r\nThe Government have contended that the applicants' claim was wholly unspecific as to the nature of the harm done to any of their economic interests. The restrictions placed on Harrods Bank were made by the Bank of England and were not caused by the publication of the report. If banking restrictions were in any way to fall within the\r\n\r\nambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Government have submitted that the measure fully complied with the requirements of that provision, given the Government's margin of appreciation in ensuring the general public interest and the proportionate nature of the restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe Commission finds the applicants' claim to have suffered a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) unsubstantiated. No evidence of any significant economic prejudice has been submitted to it. Insofar as certain management restrictions were placed on Harrods Bank by the Bank of England one month after publication of the report, the Commission notes that the applicants had a right of appeal to an independent tribunal which does not appear to have been tried\r\n\r\n(pp. 14-15 above). In the circumstances the Commission finds that no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) has been disclosed in the present case. It follows that this aspect of the application is also manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n6.\tFinally, the applicants have complained of an absence of effective domestic remedies for their above Convention claims, contrary to Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention. Article 13 (Art. 13) provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this\r\nConvention are violated shall have an effective remedy\r\nbefore a national authority notwithstanding that the\r\nviolation has been committed by persons acting in an\r\nofficial capacity.\"\r\n\r\nExamination of this complaint has two aspects. The first relates to the applicants' claim under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) (civil) of\r\n\r\nthe Convention, which the Commission retains for an examination on the merits, and the second relates to the rest of the applicants' complaints which the Commission rejects as being manifestly ill-founded. As regards the first aspect and the applicants' claim under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) (civil), the Commission considers\r\n\r\nthat the subsidiary complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention also raises a question of fact and law which requires a\r\n \r\ndetermination on the merits, no ground of inadmissibility having been established.\r\n\r\nHowever, as regards the second aspect, the Commission recalls that Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention does not require a remedy under domestic law in respect of every alleged violation of the Convention. It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an \"arguable claim\" of a violation of the Convention (Eur. Court H.R., Boyle and Rice judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A No. 131, p. 23, para. 52). The Commission has found above that the applicants' claims under Article 6 paras. 1 (criminal) and 2, Article 8 (Art. 6-1, 6-2,\r\n\r\n8)\tof the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention. In the light of the reasons\r\n\r\nupon which those findings are based, the Commission also considers that the facts of the present case fail to disclose an \"arguable claim\" of\r\n\r\na violation of these provisions. Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims. To this extent it follows that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is partially manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Commission by a majority\r\n\r\nDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE\r\nin respect of the complaint of the first three applicants\r\nunder Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) (civil) of the Convention,\r\nboth on its own and in relation to Article 13 (Art. 13) of the\r\nConvention, without prejudging the merits;\r\n\r\nDECLARES INADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident of the Commission\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n(H.C. KRÜGER)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n(C.A. NØRGAARD)\r\n",

KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\n      Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection\r\nof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the application introduced on 13 June 1990 by\r\nHarald Pfarrmeier against Austria and registered on 10 July 1990 under\r\nfile No. 16841/90;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to:\r\n\r\n-     the report provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of\r\nthe Commission;\r\n\r\n-     the observations submitted by the respondent Government on\r\n21 February 1992 and the observations in reply submitted by the\r\napplicant on 5 October 1992 ;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-     the submissions of the parties at the oral hearing on\r\n10 May 1993;\r\n\r\n      Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n      Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant is an Austrian citizen who lives in Bregenz.  He is represented before the Commission by Mr. L. W. Weh, a lawyer\r\npractising in Bregenz.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows:\r\n\r\n      On 11 June 1987 the applicant was fined by a penal order (Straferkenntnis) AS 9,000 with provision for 360 hours' detention in default for failure to submit to a breath test, contrary to Section 99 (1) (b) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (Straßenverkehrsordnung).  He appealed to the Regional Government (Landesregierung) which, on 11\r\nNovember 1987, rejected his appeal.\r\n\r\n      On 23 March 1988 the Administrative Court\r\n(Verwaltungsgerichtshof) quashed the decision of the Regional\r\nGovernment of 11 November 1987 and remitted the case to that authority.\r\nThe Regional Government's second decision, of 23 December 1988, reduced the penalty from AS 9,000 to AS 5,000 and the period of imprisonment in default from 360 hours to 200 hours.\r\n\r\n      The applicant's complaint to the Constitutional Court (Ver-\r\nfassungsgerichtshof) was rejected on 10 March 1989 on the ground that it had no sufficient prospect of success and that the case was not outside the competence of the Administrative Court.  The Constitutional\r\nCourt referred principally to its own case-law on Article 6 of the\r\nConvention in finding that the application had no sufficient prospect of success.\r\n\r\n      On 10 November 1989 the Administrative Court gave its second decision in the case.  It found that it was not prevented from considering that the factual position had been determined in a relevant and conclusive way, although it was not able to review whether the defence's version of the facts was correct.  Accordingly, the\r\nAdministrative Court could not decide whether the applicant had or had not spoken of a \"good session\" (drinking).  As to the applicant's complaint that his lawyer had not been able to examine a witness, the court noted that an oral hearing was not a necessary part of the administrative criminal proceedings.  As to the alleged unconstitutionality of the Austrian reservation to Article 5 of the Convention, the Court referred to previous case-law.  The complaint was dismissed as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleges a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in that the administrative criminal proceedings brought against him were determined initially by the administrative authorities which did not constitute independent and impartial tribunals within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention, and subsequently by the\r\nConstitutional Court and the Administrative Court, the scope of whose review is not sufficient to comply with Article 6 of the Convention, and which cannot decide the case themselves.\r\n      \r\nHe also makes specific complaints about the nature of the administrative authorities' examination of the case, including his inability to put questions to prosecution witnesses, and about the inevitably partial status of experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 13 June 1990 and registered on\r\n10 July 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 16 October 1991 the Commission decided to request the parties to submit their written observations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The respondent Government submitted their observations on 21 February 1992 and the applicant submitted his observations on 5 October 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 15 February 1993 the Commission decided to hear the parties as to the admissibility and merits of this case and Applications Nos. 15523/89, 15527/89, 15963/90, 16713/90 and 16718/90.  At the hearing the parties were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government:\r\n\r\nAmbassador F. Cede          Legal Adviser, Federal Ministry for Foreign\r\n                            Affairs, Agent\r\n\r\nMs. S. Bernegger            Federal Chancellery, Adviser\r\n\r\nFor the applicant:\r\n\r\nMr. W.L. Weh                Representative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleges violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the Austrian reservation to Article\r\n5 (Art. 5) of the Convention prevents the Commission from examining the case.  They accept, however, that if the reservation does not prevent an examination of the case, then the review of administrative decisions by the Administrative Court and Constitutional Court was not sufficiently wide to comply with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the\r\nConvention.  They add, in this respect, that although the offence for which the applicant was convicted under Section 99 (1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (refusing to take a breath test) was not, as such, in force on the date of the reservation,  the law then in force did impose an obligation on road users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users and to pay such attention as is required for the maintenance of order, safety and traffic efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Government consider that the absence of an oral public and direct hearing is covered by the Austrian reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  They also point out that the applicant did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the Administrative Court.\r\n\r\n      The applicant considers that the Austrian reservation to Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention is neither valid nor applicable in the present case.  He agrees that the scope of review by the Constitutional Court and Administrative Court does not comply with Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. He considers that the reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6), if valid, is not applicable to the present proceedings.\r\n\r\n      In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution, the Government consider that, although that provision provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the possibility for the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural limitation and not a substantive one.  They point out that any appeal lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to comprehensive review.\r\n\r\n      The applicant in this respect considers that the limitation of the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction by Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution does not meet the requirements of the reservation, even if it applies.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that the application raises complex issues of law under the Convention, including questions concerning the Austrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the Convention, the determination of which must be reserved for an examination on the merits.\r\n\r\n      The application cannot therefore be declared manifestly ill- founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.  No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons the Commission unanimously\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n      merits of the case.\r\n\r\n",

He is represented before\r\nthe Commission by Mr. W. L. Weh, a lawyer practising in Bregenz.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be\r\nsummarised as follows:\r\n\r\n      On 16 November 1988 the Imst District Authority (Bezirks-\r\nhauptmannschaft) found the applicant guilty of having committed two\r\nspeeding offences contrary to the Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrs-\r\nordnung).  The first offence involved driving in excess of the maximum\r\nspeed permitted on motorways (Section 20 para. 2 of the Road Traffic\r\nAct);  the second offence involved driving, on a further stretch of the\r\nsame road, in excess of the speed limit imposed by a road sign (Section\r\n52, sub-section A (10) (a) of the Act).  The applicant was fined AS\r\n6,000 and AS 4,000 respectively, with imprisonment of 10 days and 8\r\ndays in default.  The applicant's appeal to the Regional Government\r\n(Landesregierung) was rejected on 22 December 1988, although the\r\npenalties were reduced to AS 4,000 and AS 2,000, with the default\r\npenalties reduced to 7 and 4 days.\r\n\r\n      The applicant's complaint to the Constitutional Court\r\n(Verfassungsgerichtshof) was rejected on 10 March 1989.  The\r\nConstitutional Court referred to its own case-law on Article 6 of the\r\nConvention in finding that the application had no sufficient prospects\r\nof success.\r\n\r\n      On 25 October 1989 the Administrative Court (Verwaltungs-\r\ngerichtshof) dismissed the applicant's complaint to it.  It recalled\r\nthat a formal confrontation with a witness is only to be ordered where\r\nit is necessary in the case:  there is no right to put questions in\r\nperson to a witness.  In any event, the applicant had not shown in what\r\nway the evidence brought could have been challenged if the witnesses\r\nhad been questioned.\r\n\r\n      The Administrative Court also considered the applicant's\r\ncomplaint that he had been fined twice for the same offence.  The court\r\nrecalled its case-law that, where a person drives in excess of speed\r\nlimits imposed by a series of road signs, only one offence is\r\ncommitted.  In the present case, however, the applicant had been\r\nconvicted under two separate provisions of the Road Traffic Act, namely\r\nSections 20 and 52.  Accordingly, he had committed two separate\r\noffences which fell to be dealt with separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleges a violation of Article 6 of the Convention\r\nin that the administrative criminal proceedings brought against him\r\nwere determined initially by administrative authorities which do not\r\nconstitute independent and impartial tribunals within the meaning of\r\nArticle 6 para. 1 of the Convention, and subsequently by the\r\nConstitutional Court and the Administrative Court the scope of whose\r\nreview is not sufficient to comply with Article 6 of the Convention and\r\nwhich cannot decide the case for themselves.  He also alleges a\r\nviolation of Article 6 para. 3 (d) of the Convention in that he was not\r\nable to put questions to witnesses for the prosecution as no oral\r\nhearing was held before the administrative authorities at first and\r\nsecond instance.\r\n\r\n      The applicant also alleges a violation of Article 4 of Protocol\r\nNo. 7 to the Convention in that he was fined twice for speeding in the\r\ncourse of one journey.  He notes that in criminal proceedings the\r\n\"principle of cumulation\" (Kumulationsprinzip) would have applied, with\r\nthe result that only one \"total\" sentence would have been imposed.  In\r\nthe present case, as not criminal proceedings, but administrative\r\ncriminal proceedings were at issue, the \"principle of cumulation\" was\r\nnot applied (Article 22 of the Administrative Criminal Code).\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 28 May 1990 and registered on\r\n13 June 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 16 October 1991 the Commission decided to request the parties\r\nto submit their written observations on the admissibility and merits\r\nof the application.\r\n\r\n      The respondent Government submitted their observations on\r\n21 February 1992 and the applicant submitted his observations on\r\n5 October 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 15 February 1993 the Commission decided to hear the parties\r\nas to the admissibility and merits of this case and Applications Nos.\r\n15523/89, 15527/89, 15963/90, 16713/90 and 16841/90.  At the hearing\r\nthe parties were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government:\r\n\r\nAmbassador F. Cede          Legal Adviser, Federal Ministry for Foreign\r\n                            Affairs, Agent\r\n\r\nMs. S. Bernegger            Federal Chancellery, Adviser\r\n\r\nFor the applicant:\r\n\r\nMr. W.L. Weh                Representative\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant alleges violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention in various respects.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the Austrian reservation to Article\r\n5 (Art. 5) of the Convention prevents the Commission from examining\r\nthis complaint.  They submit that, even if the reservation does not\r\nprevent an examination, then the review of administrative decisions by\r\nthe Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court is sufficiently\r\nwide to comply with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.\r\nIn particular, they refer to Section 41 (2) 3 (a)-(c) of the\r\nAdministrative Court Act under which the Administrative Court must\r\nquash an authority's decision for violation of procedural rules where\r\nin an essential point the authority has found facts in a way which\r\ncontradicts the file,  where the facts require complementation in an\r\nessential point, or where procedural provisions have been disregarded\r\nin circumstances where, had they been observed, the authority could\r\nhave arrived at a different decision. The Government consider that the\r\nAustrian reservation to Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention, if\r\napplicable, also covers the applicant's complaint under Article 6 para.\r\n3 (d) (Art. 5-3-d).\r\n\r\n      In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal\r\nConstitution, the Government consider that, although the provision\r\nprovides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds\r\nwhich were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the\r\nability of the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with complaints\r\nagainst decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural\r\nlimitation and not a substantive one. The Government point out that any\r\ncomplaint lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is\r\nsubject to comprehensive review.\r\n\r\n      The Government consider that the absence of an oral public and\r\ndirect hearing is covered by the Austrian reservation to Article 6\r\n(Art. 6) of the Convention.  They also point out that the applicant did\r\nnot make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the\r\nAdministrative Court.\r\n\r\n      The applicant considers that the Austrian reservation to Article\r\n5 (Art. 5) of the Convention is neither valid nor applicable in the\r\npresent case and that Article 6 (Art. 6) was violated both by the\r\ninability of the Administrative Court to make findings of fact, and in\r\nthat he was unable to put questions to the prosecuting authorities.\r\nHe considers that the reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6), if valid, is\r\nnot applicable to the present proceedings.\r\n\r\n      In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal\r\nConstitution, the applicant considers that the enlarged grounds for\r\nnon-acceptance of a constitutional complaint are in any event at\r\nvariance with Convention requirements.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that these complaints raise complex issues\r\nof law under the Convention, including questions concerning the\r\nAustrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the\r\nConvention, the determination of which must be reserved for an\r\nexamination of the merits.\r\n\r\n      This part of the application cannot therefore be declared\r\nmanifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.  No other ground for declaring it\r\ninadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant also alleges a violation of Article 4 of Protocol\r\nNo. 7 (P7-4) to the Convention in that he was fined twice for speeding\r\nin the course of one journey.  Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4)\r\nprovides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in\r\n      criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for\r\n      an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or\r\n      convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that\r\n      State.\r\n      ...\"\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that the applicant, who was convicted for\r\nspeeding twice in the course of one journey, but over separate\r\nstretches of road, was convicted not of one but of two separate\r\noffences.  It follows that he was not tried or punished again \"for an\r\noffence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted\".\r\n\r\n\r\n      This part of the application must therefore be rejected as being\r\nmanifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission unanimously\r\n\r\n      DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the complaint relating to the applicant's\r\n      having been convicted twice;\r\n\r\n      DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudice to the merits, the\r\n      remainder of the application.\r\n\r\n",

He is represented before the Commission by Mr. Geoffrey\r\nBindman, a solicitor practising in London.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the present case, as submitted by the parties and\r\nwhich may be deduced from documents lodged with the application, may\r\nbe summarised as follows.\r\n\r\n      The applicant is a journalist.  In August 1989, he began working\r\nfor the publication \"The Engineer\".\r\n\r\n      On 2 November 1989, the applicant was telephoned by a source,\r\nwhich gave him information about a company, X Ltd.. The information was\r\nunsolicited, was not in exchange for payment and the applicant alleges\r\nthat he had no reason to believe that the information was derived from\r\na stolen or confidential document.  The information was given on an\r\nunattributable basis.\r\n\r\n      On 6 and 7 November 1989, the applicant telephoned X Ltd. to\r\ncheck the facts and seek their comments on the information which he had\r\nbeen given.  He prepared a draft article for publication in \"The\r\nEngineer\" to the effect that the company was in the process of raising\r\na £5 million loan and had financial problems as a result of an expected\r\nloss of £2.1 million for 1989.\r\n\r\n      X Ltd. alleged that the information was derived from a draft of\r\nits confidential Corporate Plan which had gone missing on 1 November\r\n1989.  On 7 November 1989 X Ltd. applied for and obtained an ex parte\r\ninterim injunction to restrain the publishers of \"The Engineer\"\r\npublishing any information derived from the Corporate Plan.\r\n\r\n      On 8 November 1989, a writ was issued against the publishers\r\nclaiming an injunction and a notice of motion was served seeking, inter\r\nalia, an order that the publishers disclose the identity of their\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n      On 10 November 1989, the publishers submitted their evidence for\r\nthe motion, including an affidavit by the applicant in which he\r\nreferred to notes of his conversation with his source.\r\n\r\n      On 14 November 1989, at the hearing of the motion, X Ltd.\r\nobtained an order that the publishers should disclose the applicant's\r\nnotes, which identified his source, pursuant to Section 10 of the\r\nContempt of Court Act 1981 (\"the 1981 Act\").\r\n\r\n      On 15 November 1989, X Ltd. were given leave to join the\r\napplicant and his employer to the proceedings.  The judge gave all\r\nthree defendants until 3,00 p.m. on 16 November 1989 to deliver up the\r\nnotes.  He also granted interim injunctions against the two additional\r\ndefendants, the applicant and his employer.\r\n\r\n      On 16 November 1989, X Ltd. informed all national newspapers and\r\nrelevant journals of the injunction.\r\n\r\n      On 17 November 1989, the High Court made an order that the\r\napplicant represented all persons who received the plan or information\r\nderived from it without the authority of X Ltd. and that such persons\r\nshould, inter alia, deliver up any copies of the plan in their\r\npossession.  The motion was then adjourned for the applicant to bring\r\nthis order to the attention of his source.  The applicant declined to\r\ndo so however.\r\n\r\n      On 22 November 1989, the applicant was again ordered to disclose\r\nhis notes: this time by the deadline of 3.00 pm on 23 November 1989.\r\nMr. Justice Hoffman stated that it was necessary \"in the interests of\r\njustice\" for the purposes of Section 10 of the 1981 Act for the\r\nsource's identity to be disclosed to enable X Ltd. to bring proceedings\r\nagainst the source to recover the document, to obtain an injunction\r\npreventing further publication or to seek damages for the expenses to\r\nwhich they had been put.  Although the applicant was an innocent\r\nrecipient of the information, the judge concluded that the source who\r\nhad telephoned the applicant had probably seen the stolen document and\r\nindeed was probably the thief. He was satisfied that there was strong\r\nprima facie evidence that X Ltd. had suffered a serious wrong by the\r\ntheft of its confidential file and that it would suffer serious\r\ncommercial damage if the information was disclosed.  He dismissed the\r\nargument of the applicant that it was in the public interest for the\r\ninformation to be disclosed, stating that there was nothing to show\r\nthat previously published information about the company was false and\r\nthat there was no legal or moral ground for making the information\r\navailable to customers, suppliers or competitors.\r\n\r\n      The applicant applied the same day to the Court of Appeal for a\r\nstay.  The stay was refused but the Court of Appeal substituted an\r\norder that the applicant either disclose his notes to X Ltd. or deliver\r\nthem to the Court in a sealed envelope with accompanying affidavit. The\r\napplicant did not comply with either order by the deadline.\r\n\r\n      On 23 November 1989, the applicant lodged an appeal against the\r\norder of 22 November on the grounds that the disclosure order was not\r\nnecessary in the interests of justice, and that the public interest in\r\npublication outweighed the interest in preserving confidentiality, and\r\nthat since the applicant had not facilitated the breach of confidence,\r\na disclosure order against him was not valid.  The same day, the\r\napplicant was served with a notice of motion seeking his committal for\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n      On 24 November 1989, in a hearing in the High Court it was\r\nconceded by the applicant's counsel that he was in contempt.  The\r\nmotion was however adjourned pending the applicant's appeal.\r\n\r\n      On 29 November 1989, the Court of Appeal began to hear the\r\napplicant's appeal.  While it heard counsel for the publisher and the\r\napplicant's employer, it refused to hear applicant's counsel since the\r\napplicant was in continuing contempt.\r\n\r\n      On 12 December 1989, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal\r\nagainst the disclosure order but granted leave to appeal to the House\r\nof Lords.  Lord Justice McGowan noted that the applicant must have been\r\n\"amazingly naive\" if it did not occur to him that the source was at the\r\nvery least guilty of a breach of confidence.\r\n\r\n      The appeal was heard before the House of Lords between 5 and\r\n8 March 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 4 April 1990, the House of Lords dismissed the appeal.  It\r\napplied the principle expounded by Lord Reid in a previous leading case\r\nand applied in previous cases:\r\n\r\n      \"<The authorities> seem to me to point to a very reasonable\r\n      principle that if through no fault of his own a person gets\r\n      mixed up in the tortious acts of others so as to facilitate\r\n      their wrong-doing he may incur no personal liability but he\r\n      comes under a duty to assist the person who has been\r\n      wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the\r\n      identity of the wrongdoers.\" (Norwich Pharmacal Co. v.\r\n      Customs and Excise Commissioners [1974] A.C. 133).\r\n\r\n      Lord Bridge, in one of the five separate speeches given in the\r\napplicant's case, stated:\r\n\r\n      \"Whenever disclosure is sought, as here, of a document\r\n      which will disclose the identity of a source within the\r\n      ambit of Section 10, the statutory restriction operates\r\n      unless the party seeking disclosure can satisfy the court\r\n      that 'disclosure is necessary' in the interests of one of\r\n      the four matters of public concern that are listed in the\r\n      Section. I think it is indisputable that where a judge asks\r\n      himself the question: 'Can I be satisfied that disclosure\r\n      of the source of this information is necessary to serve\r\n      this interest?' he has to engage in a balancing exercise.\r\n      He starts with the assumptions, first, that the protection\r\n      of sources is itself a matter of high public importance,\r\n      secondly, that nothing less than necessity will suffice to\r\n      override it, thirdly, that the necessity can only arise out\r\n      of concern for another matter of high public importance,\r\n      being one of the four interests listed in the Section ...\"\r\n\r\n      He referred to a number of other cases in relation to how the\r\nbalancing exercise should be conducted (e.g. Secretary of State for\r\nDefence v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd [1985] A.C. 339) and continued:\r\n\r\n      \"It would be foolish to attempt to give comprehensive\r\n      guidance as to how the balancing exercise should be carried\r\n      out. But it may not be out of place to indicate the kind of\r\n      factors which will require consideration.  In estimating\r\n      the importance to be given to the case in favour of\r\n      disclosure there will be a wide spectrum within which the\r\n      particular case must be located.  If the party seeking\r\n      disclosure shows, for example, that his very livelihood\r\n      depends upon it, this will put the case near one end of the\r\n      spectrum.  If he shows no more than that what he seeks to\r\n      protect is a minor interest in property, this will put the\r\n      case at or near the other end.  On the other side the\r\n      importance of protecting a source from disclosure in\r\n      pursuance of the policy underlying the statute will also\r\n      vary within a wide spectrum.  One important factor will be\r\n      the nature of the information obtained from the source.\r\n      The greater the legitimate public interest in the\r\n      information which the source has given to the publisher or\r\n      intended publisher, the greater will be the importance of\r\n      protecting the source.  But another and perhaps more\r\n      significant factor which will very much affect the\r\n      importance of protecting the source will be the manner in\r\n      which the information was itself obtained by the source. If\r\n      it appears to the court that the information was obtained\r\n      legitimately this will enhance the importance of protecting\r\n      the source.  Conversely, if it appears that the information\r\n      was obtained illegally, this will diminish the importance\r\n      of protecting the source unless, of course, this factor is\r\n      counterbalanced by a clear public interest in publication\r\n      of the information, as in the classic case where the source\r\n      has acted for the purpose of exposing iniquity.  I draw\r\n      attention to these considerations by way of illustration\r\n      only and I emphasise once again that they are in no way\r\n      intended to be read as a code ...\r\n\r\n      In the circumstances of the instant case, I have no doubt\r\n      that Hoffmann J. and the Court of Appeal were right in\r\n      finding that the necessity for disclosure of Mr. Goodwin's\r\n      notes in the interests of justice was established.  The\r\n      importance to the plaintiffs of obtaining disclosure lies\r\n      in the threat of severe damage to their business, and\r\n      consequentially to the livelihood of their employees, which\r\n      would arise from disclosure of the information contained in\r\n      their corporate plan while their refinancing negotiations\r\n      are still continuing.  This threat, accurately described by\r\n      Lord Donaldson of Lymington M.R. [1990] 2 W.L.R. 421, 439,\r\n      as 'ticking away beneath them like a time bomb' can only be\r\n      defused if they can identify the source either as himself\r\n      the thief of the stolen copy of the plan or as a means to\r\n      lead to the identification of the thief and thus put\r\n      themselves in a position to institute proceedings for the\r\n      recovery of the missing document.  The importance of\r\n      protecting the source on the other hand is much diminished\r\n      by the source's complicity, at the very least, in a gross\r\n      breach of confidentiality which is not counterbalanced by\r\n      any legitimate interest which publication of the\r\n      information was calculated to serve.  Disclosure in the\r\n      interests of justice is, on this view of the balance,\r\n      clearly of preponderating importance so as to override the\r\n      policy underlying the statutory protection of sources and\r\n      the test of necessity for disclosure is satisfied ...\"\r\n\r\n      Lord Templeman concurring also commented that the applicant ought\r\nto have \"recognised that (the information) was both confidential and\r\ndamaging\".\r\n\r\n      On 10 April 1990, the High Court fined the applicant £5 000 for\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nRELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\n\r\n      Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides:\r\n\r\n      \"No court may require a person to disclose, nor is a person\r\n      guilty of contempt of court for refusing to disclose the\r\n      source of information contained in the publication for\r\n      which he is responsible, unless it be established to the\r\n      satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in\r\n      the interests of justice or national security or for\r\n      prevention of disorder or crime.\"\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant invokes Article 10 para. 1 of the Convention. He\r\nsubmits that the disclosure order made by the High Court and confirmed\r\non appeal constituted an interference with his freedom of expression\r\nby a public authority. According to the applicant, the order has a\r\nchilling effect on the likelihood of sources communicating information\r\nto journalists such as himself, and his right to impart information to\r\nthe public has also been impaired thereby.\r\n\r\n      The applicant contends that the disclosure order was not\r\nprescribed by law, since it was based on the general law under which\r\nan order can be made for the disclosure of the identity of a wrong-doer\r\nand the provisions of Section 10 of the 1981 Act.  The requirements of\r\nforeseeability were not satisfied in these circumstances. Further,\r\nwhile conceding that the order pursued the legitimate aim of protecting\r\nthe rights of others, namely, X Ltd., the applicant considers that\r\nthere was no pressing social need for the restraint, since X Ltd. was\r\nalready protected by the injunction against leakage of confidential\r\ninformation.  The restraint was also not proportionate to the aim,\r\nsince it has cast a disproportionate chilling effect on the free flow\r\nof information generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 27 September 1990 and\r\nregistered on 26 November 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 7 April 1992, the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the respondent Government and to ask for written\r\nobservations on the admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 18 August 1992\r\nafter one extension in the time-limit and the applicant's observations\r\nin reply were submitted on 3 December 1992 after two extensions in the\r\ntime-limit.\r\n\r\n      On  11 December 1992,  the Commission decided to grant legal aid\r\nto the applicant.\r\n\r\n      On 2 April 1993, the Commission decided to invite the parties to\r\nmake further observations on the admissibility and merits of the\r\napplication at an oral hearing.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing, which took place on 7 September 1993, the\r\nGovernment were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Iain Christie           Agent\r\nMr. Michael Baker QC        Counsel\r\nMr. Oliver Parker           Adviser, Lord Chancellor's Department\r\n\r\n      The applicant was represented as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Geoffrey Robertson QC   Counsel\r\nMr. Geoffrey Bindman        Solicitor\r\nMr. Robert Sack       )     Lawyers from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, New\r\nMs. Anne Hilker       )     York\r\n\r\n      The applicant was also present.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that the disclosure order imposed by the\r\nHigh Court constituted an interference with his right to freedom of\r\nexpression contrary to Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention provides:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This\r\n      right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive\r\n      and impart information and ideas without interference by\r\n      public authorities and regardless of frontiers...\r\n\r\n      2.   The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with\r\n      it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such\r\n      formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are\r\n      prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic\r\n      society, in the interests of national security, territorial\r\n      integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder\r\n      or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the\r\n      protection of the reputation or rights of others, for\r\n      preventing the disclosure of information received in\r\n      confidence, or for maintaining the authority and\r\n      impartiality of the judiciary.\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that the disclosure order made by the High\r\nCourt and confirmed on appeal constituted an interference with his\r\nfreedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 (Art. 10) of the\r\nConvention. According to the applicant, the order has a chilling effect\r\non the likelihood of sources communicating information to journalists\r\nsuch as himself, and his right to impart information to the public has\r\nalso been impaired thereby.\r\n\r\n      The applicant contends that the disclosure order breached his\r\nduty of confidentiality to his source and was not \"prescribed by law\",\r\nsince  the law permitting such orders is not formulated with sufficient\r\nprecision to enable the individual to foresee with reasonable certainty\r\nwhen it will be applied.  In particular, he argues that the criterion\r\nof the \"interests of justice\" is insufficiently certain and renders\r\nimpossible the task of a journalist in assessing whether or not he can\r\ngive a source an undertaking not to reveal his identity. Further, the\r\napplicant considers that there was no pressing social need for the\r\nrestraint, since X Ltd. was already protected by the injunction against\r\npublication of confidential information in the press and had made no\r\nuse of alternative means of identifying the source.  The restraint was\r\nalso not proportionate to the aim, since it included the threat to the\r\napplicant of up to two years' imprisonment and has cast a\r\ndisproportionate chilling effect on the free flow of information to the\r\npublic generally.\r\n\r\n      The Government accept that the action of the courts amounted to\r\na restriction on the applicant's freedom of expression within the scope\r\nof the first paragraph of Article 10 (Art. 10). The Government submit\r\nhowever that the interference was \"prescribed by law\" within the\r\nmeaning of the second paragraph, and refer to domestic case-law as\r\nindicating that  the relevant principle is well-established, accessible\r\nand foreseeable in its application and consequences.\r\n\r\n      The Government further submit that the interference was\r\n\"necessary in a democratic society\" for the purpose of protecting the\r\nrights of others and for preventing the disclosure of information\r\nreceived in confidence. They submit that Section 10 of the 1981 Act\r\ngives recognition to the high public importance of protecting the free\r\nflow of information to the press and provides a heavy presumption\r\nagainst ordering disclosure. The interest of protecting journalistic\r\nsources cannot however outweigh all others and, they argue, in the\r\nassessment of whether \"the interests of justice\" required disclosure\r\nin this particular case, the domestic courts gave full and reasoned\r\nconsideration to all the competing interests. The Government contend\r\nthat having regard to the margin of appreciation, accorded to\r\nContracting States, there is no ground on which the Commission in its\r\nsupervisory jurisdiction can substitute its own opinion for that of the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that the applicant's complaints under\r\nArticle 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and\r\nlaw, the determination of which should depend on a full examination of\r\nthe merits. These complaints cannot therefore be regarded as manifestly\r\nill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention. No other ground for declaring the case inadmissible has\r\nbeen established.\r\n\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission, by a majority,\r\n\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE without prejudging the\r\n      merits.\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary to the Commission          President of the Commission\r\n\r\n\r\n     (M. DE SALVIA)                               (C.A. NØRGAARD)\r\n\r\n",

NØRGAARD, President\r\n\r\nS.\tTRECHSEL F. ERMACORA E. BUSUTTIL\r\n\r\nG. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK J.-C. SOYER\r\nH. DANELIUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMM.\tL. LOUCAIDES M.P. PELLONPÄÄ G.B. REFFI M.A. NOWICKI\r\nI. CABRAL BARRETO\r\n\r\nMr.\tH.C. KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\nHaving regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the application introduced on 14 August 1991 by Margaret McCANN, Daniel FARRELL and John SAVAGE against the United Kingdom and registered on 24 October 1991 under file No. 18984/91;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to:\r\n\r\n-\treports provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n-\tthe observations submitted by the respondent Government on 11 August 1992 and the observations in reply submitted by the applicants on 14 January 1993;\r\n\r\n-\tthe parties' submissions at the oral hearing before the Commission on 3 September 1993;\r\n\r\nHaving deliberated;\r\n\r\nDecides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The applicants are representatives of the respective estates of\r\nDaniel McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage. They are all citizens\r\nof both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. They are\r\nrepresented before the Commission by Messrs. P.J. McGrory & Co.,\r\nsolicitors practising in Belfast.\r\n\r\n      The facts, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n      On 6 March 1988, Daniel McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage\r\nwere shot and killed in Gibraltar by members of the Special Air Service\r\n(the \"S.A.S.\") which is a regiment of the British Army. All three of\r\nthe victims were members of the Provisional I.R.A. which acknowledged\r\nthem to have been on \"active service\" at the time of their deaths.\r\nMairead Farrell had previously been convicted and sentenced to 14\r\nyears' imprisonment for causing explosions and Daniel McCann had been\r\npreviously convicted and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment for\r\npossession of explosives.\r\n\r\n      At the time that they were killed, the three deceased were\r\nunarmed and carried no explosive detonation device. There was also no\r\ncar bomb present on Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n      An Inquest by the Gibraltar Coroner into the killings was opened\r\non 6 September 1988. The families of the deceased (the applicants) were\r\nrepresented, as were the S.A.S soldiers and the United Kingdom\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n      Prior to the Inquest, three certificates to the effect that\r\ncertain information should not, in the public interest, be disclosed,\r\nwere issued by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the\r\nSecretary of State for Defence and the Deputy Governor of Gibraltar,\r\ndated respectively 26 August, 30 August and 2 September 1988. These\r\nstated that the public interest required that the following categories\r\nof information be protected from disclosure:\r\n\r\n      1. In the case of the seven military witnesses, the objection\r\n      was to the disclosure of any information or documents which would\r\n      reveal:\r\n\r\n      (i) their identity;\r\n\r\n      (ii) the identity, location, chains of command, method of\r\n      operation and the capabilities of the units with which the\r\n      soldiers were serving on 6 March 1988;\r\n\r\n      (iii) the nature of their specialist training or equipment;\r\n\r\n      (iv) the nature of any previous operational activities of the\r\n      soldiers, or of any units with which any of them might at any\r\n      time have served;\r\n\r\n      (v) in the case of Soldier \"G\" (the Ammunition Technical\r\n      Officer), any defence intelligence information, activities or\r\n      operations (and the sources of intelligence), including those on\r\n      the basis of which his assessments were made and details of\r\n      security forces counter-measures capabilities, including methods\r\n      of operation, specialist training and equipment.\r\n\r\n      2. In the case of Security Service witnesses, the objection was\r\n      to the disclosure of information which would reveal:\r\n\r\n      (a) the identities of members of the Security Service, and\r\n      details of their deployment, training and equipment;\r\n\r\n      (b) all sources of intelligence information;\r\n\r\n      (c) all details of the activities and operations of the Security\r\n      Services.\r\n\r\n      As was, however, expressly made clear in the certificates, no\r\nobjection was taken to the giving of evidence by either military or\r\nSecurity Service witnesses as to:\r\n\r\n      (i) the nature of the information relating to the feared IRA\r\n      plot, which was transmitted to the Commissioner of Police and\r\n      others concerned (including general evidence as to the nature of\r\n      a Provisional IRA Active Service Unit);\r\n\r\n      (ii) the assessments made by Soldier \"G\" as to the likelihood of,\r\n      and the risks associated with, an explosive device and as to the\r\n      protective measures which might have to be taken;\r\n\r\n      (iii) the events leading up to the shootings on 6 March 1988 and\r\n      the circumstances surrounding them, including evidence relating\r\n      to the transfer of control to the military power.\r\n\r\n      At the Inquest, the applicants argued, inter alia, that the\r\ndecision to shoot to kill the suspects had been made by the United\r\nKingdom Government prior to the incident and, in any event, the force\r\nused was excessive and not justified.\r\n\r\n      United Kingdom security officers gave evidence to the effect that\r\nthey had received information that a car, driven by suspects over the\r\nborder from Spain, would be carrying a bomb intended to be detonated\r\nat the assembly of the band and other troops for the Changing of the\r\nGuard ceremony at Gibraltar on 8 March 1988. They had formed the view\r\nthat it was likely that the bomb would be set off by a remote control\r\ndevice. It was expected that the suspects would be armed.\r\n\r\n      The Commissioner of Gibraltar Police gave evidence to the effect\r\nthat, after the presence of the three suspects on Gibraltar was\r\nconfirmed, and he had been informed by soldier G. that the aerial on\r\na parked car did not appear to be an original aerial and might be\r\nindicative that there was a bomb in the car, he had decided that the\r\nthree suspects should be arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.\r\nHe signed an order requesting the military to intercept and apprehend\r\nthe three suspects. This form provided by the military read as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"I, Joseph Luis Canepa, Commissioner of Police, having\r\n      considered the terrorist situation in Gibraltar and having\r\n      been fully briefed on the military plan with firearms,\r\n      request that you proceed with the military option which may\r\n      include the use of lethal force for the preservation of\r\n      life.\"\r\n\r\n      The four S.A.S. soldiers involved in the shooting also gave\r\nevidence. They stated, inter alia, that they had been following the\r\nthree suspects with a view to effecting an arrest, that the suspects\r\nhad appeared to become aware of their presence, that each of the\r\nsuspects had made a suspicious and/or sudden gesture and that they had\r\nshot them to prevent activation of the suspected bomb by remote\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n      At the conclusion of the Inquest, the Coroner referred the jury\r\nto Article 2 of the Gibraltar Constitution:\r\n\r\n      \"2.(1) No person shall be deprived of his life intentionally save\r\n      in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal\r\n      offence of which he has been convicted.\r\n\r\n      (2) A person shall not be regarded as having been deprived of his\r\n      life in contravention of this section if he dies as a result of\r\n      the use to such extent and in such circumstances as are permitted\r\n      by law, of such force as is reasonably justifiable:\r\n\r\n           a. for the defence of any person from violence or for the\r\n           defence of property;\r\n\r\n           b. in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the\r\n           escape of a person lawfully detained...\r\n\r\n           d. in order to prevent the commission by that person of a\r\n           criminal offence.\"\r\n\r\n      The jury returned verdicts of lawful killing by a majority.\r\n\r\n      The applicants were dissatisfied with these verdicts and\r\ncommenced actions in the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland\r\nagainst the Ministry of Defence for the loss and damage suffered by the\r\nestate of each deceased as a result of their death. The statements of\r\nclaim were served on 1 March 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 15 March 1990 the Secretary of State for Foreign and\r\nCommonwealth Affairs issued certificates under Section 40(3)a of the\r\nCrown Proceedings Act 1947, as amended by the Crown Proceedings\r\n(Northern Ireland) Order 1981. Section 40(2)b of the same Act excludes\r\nproceedings in Northern Ireland against the Crown in respect of\r\nliability arising otherwise than \"in respect of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment in the United Kingdom\". A similar exemption applies to the\r\nCrown in Northern Ireland pursuant to the 1981 Order. A certificate by\r\nthe Secretary of State to that effect is conclusive. The certificates\r\nstated in this case that any alleged liability of the Crown arose\r\nneither in respect of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom,\r\nnor in respect of Her Majesty's Government in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n      The Ministry of Defence then moved to have the actions struck\r\nout. The applicants challenged the legality of the certificates in\r\njudicial review proceedings. Leave to apply for judicial  review was\r\ngranted ex parte on 6 July 1990, but withdrawn on 31 May 1991 following\r\na full hearing, on the basis that the application had no reasonable\r\nprospects of success. Senior Counsel advised that an appeal against\r\nthis decision would be futile.\r\n\r\n      The applicants' High Court actions were struck off on\r\n4 October 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicants, representing the estates of the deceased, claim\r\na violation of Article 2 of the Convention as a result of the killings\r\nof 6 March 1988. They complain that the three deceased were\r\nintentionally deprived of their right to life by the use of\r\nunnecessary, unlawful force, without any attempt to effect a lawful\r\narrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 14 August 1991 and registered\r\non 24 October 1991.\r\n\r\n      On 20 February 1992, the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the Government and to ask for written observations on\r\nthe admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 11 August 1992\r\nafter one extension in the time-limit and the applicants' observations\r\nin reply were  submitted on 13 January 1993 after two extensions in the\r\ntime-limit.\r\n\r\n      On 23 October 1992, the Commission decided to grant legal aid to\r\nthe applicants.\r\n\r\n      On 2 April 1993, the Commission decided to invite the parties to\r\nmake further submissions at an oral hearing.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing, which was held on 3 September 1993, the\r\nGovernment were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nMrs. Audrey Glover               Agent\r\nMr. Stephen Richards             Counsel\r\nMr. James Eadie                  Counsel\r\nMr. Nicholas Lavender            Counsel\r\nMr. David Pickup                 Adviser, Ministry of Defence\r\nMr. Michael Venables             Adviser, Ministry of Defence\r\nMr. David Seymour                Adviser, Home Office\r\n\r\n      The applicants were represented as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Douwe Korff                  Counsel\r\nMr. P.J.B. McGrory               Solicitor\r\nMr. Niall Farrell                Son of the applicant, Mr. Daniel\r\n                                                            Farrell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicants complain of the killing of the three deceased by\r\nthe S.A.S on Gibraltar. They invoke Article 2 (Art. 2) of the\r\nConvention which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1. Everyone's right to life shall be protected by law.  No one\r\n      shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution\r\n      of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for\r\n      which this penalty is provided by law.\r\n\r\n      2. Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in\r\n      contravention of this Article when it results from the use of\r\n      force which is no more than absolutely necessary:\r\n\r\n      a.   in defence of any person from unlawful violence;\r\n\r\n      b.   in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape\r\n           of a person lawfully detained;\r\n\r\n      c.   in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot\r\n           or insurrection.\"\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the applicants have not exhausted\r\ndomestic remedies in respect of their complaints, as required by\r\nArticle 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, since they failed to institute\r\nproceedings for unlawful killings before the Gibraltar courts which had\r\nexclusive jurisdiction.  They submit that it is incorrect to state that\r\nthe certificates issued in the proceedings in Northern Ireland barred\r\nthe applicants' action: they were merely evidential in character. They\r\nsubmit that the courts in Northern Ireland  by operation of law did not\r\nhave jurisdiction to consider the applicants' claims. Proceedings in\r\nGibraltar would however have provided an effective remedy.  The\r\napplicants cannot be absolved from exhausting this domestic remedy\r\nmerely on the basis of their ineligibility for legal aid.  They have\r\nto establish that their financial constraints and other circumstances\r\nrendered such a course impossible.\r\n\r\n      The applicants submit that they have complied with the\r\nrequirement as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies imposed by\r\nArticle 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention. They were unable to pursue\r\nproceedings in the High Court in Northern Ireland since the\r\ncertificates excluded the jurisdiction of the courts. They contest that\r\ntheir claims necessarily raised matters outside the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourts in Northern Ireland. Further, they were unable to take\r\nproceedings in Gibraltar since they were not eligible for legal aid and\r\nhad no other means of pursuing such proceedings.\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate\r\nto the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can\r\nprovide effective and sufficient redress.  An applicant does not need\r\nto exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to\r\nconstitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing\r\nthe alleged breach. The Commission has held that where, for example,\r\nthere is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 26\r\n(Art. 26) of the Convention must be applied to reflect the practical\r\nrealities of the applicant's position in order to ensure the effective\r\nprotection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (cf.\r\nNo. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78, and No. 9118/80, Dec.\r\n9.3.83, D.R. 32 p. 159).\r\n\r\n      It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the\r\nexistence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the\r\nState invoking the rule (cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27\r\nFebruary 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec.\r\n11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102).\r\n\r\n      In the present case, the Commission notes that the applicants,\r\nas conceded by the Government, would not have been eligible for legal\r\naid in Gibraltar. The Commission finds that they have insufficient\r\nmeans to pay for legal representation themselves. In this context the\r\nCommission recalls that they were found eligible under the financial\r\ncriteria for legal aid in Northern Ireland and before the Commission\r\nitself. Having regard, in addition, to the difficulties imposed by the\r\ndistance and the difficulty and complexity of the factual and legal\r\nissues which would have been raised in proceedings in Gibraltar, the\r\napplicants could not have proceeded without legal representation.\r\nConsequently, the Commission finds that the remedy cannot realistically\r\nhave been available to the applicants in this case.\r\n\r\n      Further, the Commission finds that the applicants' choice of\r\npursuing proceedings in the courts of Northern Ireland was not\r\nunreasonable or without basis in domestic law. The applicants in those\r\nproceedings (in respect of which they were granted legal aid by the\r\nrelevant domestic authorities) intended, inter alia, to argue that\r\nliability arose out of the actions of Crown agents based in the United\r\nKingdom and Northern Ireland. The certificates issued by the Secretary\r\nof State were however conclusive of the fact that the alleged liability\r\ndid not arise in respect of the Government in the United Kingdom or in\r\nNorthern Ireland and effectively put an end to the proceedings.\r\n\r\n      In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application\r\ncannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\n      As regards the substance of the case, the applicants submit that\r\nthere has been a violation of Article 2 (Art. 2) of the Convention in\r\nrespect of the shooting of the three deceased persons. They consider\r\nthat Article 2 (Art. 2) imposes a duty on States to adopt clear and\r\ndetailed legal rules on the use of lethal force, which strictly control\r\nand limit that use. They consider that United Kingdom law is vague and\r\ngeneral and therefore is in itself in violation of this provision. They\r\nsubmit that Article 2 (Art. 2) requires, in addition, that States\r\nexercise strict operational control over the use of lethal force,\r\nincluding the giving of appropriate training, briefings and\r\ninstructions. They contend that soldiers are trained to shoot to kill\r\nwithout warning and that the operation in Gibraltar was neither planned\r\nnor executed in such a way as to minimise the need for the use of\r\nlethal force. They point to the fact that the soldiers were apparently\r\nmade to believe (wrongly) firstly, that the suspects were armed;\r\nsecondly, that there was a car bomb in place; and thirdly, that the\r\nbomb could be detonated by the suspects by means of a remote control\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The applicants further submit that Article 2 (Art. 2) should be\r\ninterpreted as including a procedural element, namely, the provision\r\nof an effective procedure after a lethal shooting for establishing the\r\nfacts. They complain that the Inquest was inadequate, inter alia, as\r\npublic interest certificates were used to block crucial evidence. They\r\nallege that there had been a lack of diligence in seeking out witnesses\r\nand attempts made to intimidate and discredit those who did come\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that specific protection of life is\r\nprovided by the Gibraltar Constitution and that this is in conformity\r\nwith the standards imposed by Article 2 (Art. 2). They point out that\r\nthe jury on consideration of the evidence found that the killings were\r\nlawful. They contend that it is implicit from that finding that the\r\njury considered that there had been no plot to kill the deceased\r\nterrorists, that the soldiers had honestly and reasonably believed that\r\nthere was a car bomb which could be detonated by remote control and\r\nthat the degree of force used by the soldiers was proportionate to the\r\naim of protecting the lives of the people of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n      As regards the Inquest proceedings, the Government submit that\r\nit provided an exhaustive fact-finding investigation by an independent\r\nbody. In particular, they highlight the fact that 78 witnesses\r\n(including the S.A.S soldiers and Security Service personnel involved\r\nin the incident) were extensively examined and cross-examined by the\r\nlegal representatives of the applicants, that the Inquest was held\r\nwithin six months of the incident, that the applicants' representatives\r\nmade no challenge to the public immunity certificates, and that the\r\nCoroner exercised his discretion to allow certain questions, despite\r\nobjection by the Crown on the basis of the certificates.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that the applicants' complaints under\r\nArticle 2 (Art. 2) of the Convention raise complex issues of fact and\r\nlaw, the determination of which should depend on the merits. The\r\napplication must therefore be declared admissible, no other ground for\r\ndeclaring it inadmissible having been established.\r\n\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission by a majority\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n      merits of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He is represented before the\r\nCommission by Messrs. Madden and Finucane, Solicitors, Belfast.\r\n\r\n      The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was arrested by police officers at 5.40 pm on\r\n7 January 1990 pursuant to section 14 of the Prevention of Terrorism\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Act 1989.  The applicant was cautioned by the\r\npolice according to the terms of Article 3 of the Criminal Evidence\r\n(Northern Ireland) Order 1988 (hereafter referred to as the Order), the\r\nrelevant part of which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Circumstances in which inferences may be drawn from accused's\r\n      failure to mention particular facts when questioned, charged,\r\n      etc.\r\n\r\n      3.   (1) Where, in any proceedings against a person for an\r\n      offence, evidence is given that the accused\r\n\r\n      (a) at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being\r\n      questioned by a constable trying to discover whether or by whom\r\n      the offence has been committed, failed to mention any fact relied\r\n      on in his defence in those proceedings; or\r\n\r\n      (b) on being charged with the offence or officially informed that\r\n      he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact,\r\n\r\n      being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time the\r\n      accused could reasonably have been expected to mention when so\r\n      questioned, charged or informed, as the case may be, paragraph\r\n      (2) applies.\r\n\r\n      (2) Where this paragraph applies\r\n\r\n      (a) the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for\r\n      trial or whether there is a case to answer,\r\n\r\n      (b) a judge, in deciding whether to grant an application made by\r\n      the accused under Article 5 of the Criminal Justice (Serious\r\n      Fraud) (Northern Ireland) Order 1988 (application for dismissal\r\n      of charge where a case of fraud has been transferred from a\r\n      magistrates' court to the Crown Court under Article 3 of that\r\n      Order), and\r\n\r\n      (c) the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is\r\n      guilty of the offence charged,\r\n\r\n      may\r\n\r\n           (i) draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper;\r\n\r\n           (ii) on the basis of such inferences treat the failure as,\r\n           or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence\r\n           given against the accused in relation to which the failure\r\n           is material.\r\n\r\n      (3) Subject to any directions by the court, evidence tending to\r\n      establish the failure may be given before or after evidence\r\n      tending to establish the fact which the accused is alleged to\r\n      have failed to mention.\"\r\n\r\n      In response to the police caution the applicant stated, \"I have\r\nnothing to say.\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant was taken to Castlereagh Police Office at about\r\n7.00 pm. He refused to give his personal details to the officer opening\r\nthe custody record. At 7.05 pm, he was informed of his right to have\r\na friend or relative notified of his detention  but indicated that he\r\ndid not require that anyone be so notified. At 7.06 pm, the applicant\r\nindicated that he wished to consult with a solicitor named Mr. Francis\r\nKeenan. At 7.30 pm, the applicant's access to a solicitor was delayed\r\non the authority of a Detective Superintendent pursuant to section\r\n15(1) of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1987. The\r\ndelay was authorised for a period of 48 hours from the time of\r\ndetention on the basis that the detective Superintendent had reasonable\r\ngrounds to believe that the exercise of the right of access\r\n\r\n      \"..<would> lead to interference with the gathering of information\r\n      about the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of\r\n      terrorism; or by alerting any person <would> make it more\r\n      difficult-\r\n\r\n      i. to prevent an act of terrorism, or\r\n\r\n      ii. to secure the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any\r\n      person in connection with the commission, preparation or\r\n      instigation of an act of terrorism.\"\r\n\r\n       At 9.27 pm, a police officer saw the applicant in a cell at\r\nCastlereagh Police Office.  He further cautioned the applicant pursuant\r\nto Article 6 of the Order, the relevant part of which provides as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      \"Inferences from failure or refusal to account for presence at\r\n      a particular place\r\n\r\n      6.   (1) Where\r\n\r\n      (a) a person arrested by a constable was found by him at a place\r\n      or about the time the offence for which he was arrested is\r\n      alleged to have been committed, and\r\n\r\n      (b) the constable reasonably believes that the presence of the\r\n      person at that place and at that time may be attributable to his\r\n      participation in the commission of the offence, and\r\n\r\n      (c) the constable informs the person that he so believes, and\r\n      requests him to account for that presence, and\r\n\r\n      (d) the person fails or refuses to do so,\r\n\r\n      then if, in any proceedings against the person for the offence,\r\n      evidence of those matters is given, paragraph (2) applies.\r\n\r\n      (2) Where this paragraph applies\r\n\r\n      (a) the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for\r\n      trial or whether there is a case to answer, and\r\n\r\n      (b) the court or jury, in determining whether the accused is\r\n      guilty of the offence charged, may\r\n\r\n           (i) draw such inferences from the failure or refusal as\r\n           appear proper;\r\n\r\n           (ii) on the basis of such inferences, treat the failure or\r\n           refusal as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of\r\n           any evidence given against the accused in relation to which\r\n           the failure or refusal is material.\r\n\r\n      (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply unless the accused was\r\n      told in ordinary language by the constable when making the\r\n      request mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) what the effect of this\r\n      Article would be if he failed or refused to do so.\r\n\r\n      (4) This Article does not preclude the drawing of any inference\r\n      from the failure or refusal of a person to account for his\r\n      presence at a place which could properly be drawn apart from this\r\n      Article.\"\r\n\r\n      The police officer served the applicant with a written copy of\r\nArticle 6 of the Order.  The applicant replied, \"Nothing to say.\"\r\n\r\n      At 10.40 pm, the applicant requested consultation with a\r\ndifferent firm of solicitors, Madden and Finucane. The reasons for the\r\ndelay in access to a solicitor were reviewed but it was concluded that\r\nthey remained valid reasons.\r\n\r\n      On 8 and 9 January 1990, the applicant was interviewed twelve\r\ntimes by police detectives at Castlereagh Police Office.  Before each\r\ninterview the applicant was either cautioned under Article 3 of the\r\nOrder or reminded that he was under caution.  The applicant maintained\r\nsilence throughout these interviews.\r\n\r\n      When he was able to see his solicitor for the first time at 6.33\r\npm on 9 January 1990, he was advised to remain silent, which he did\r\nduring the following two interviews. His solicitor was not permitted\r\nto be present during these interviews.\r\n\r\n      The applicant was tried by a single judge, the Lord Chief Justice\r\nof Northern Ireland, sitting without a jury, on 8 May 1991, for several\r\noffences including that of conspiracy to murder, aiding and abetting,\r\nwith seven other people, the false imprisonment of a certain Mr. L. and\r\nof belonging to a proscribed organisation ie the Provisional Irish\r\nRepublican Army.\r\n\r\n      The Crown case was that for some time prior to January 1990\r\nMr. L. had been a member of the Provisional I.R.A. and had also been\r\ngiving information about the activities of the Provisional I.R.A. to\r\nthe Royal Ulster Constabulary.  The Provisional I.R.A. discovered that\r\nMr. L. was an informer and tricked him into going to a house, 124\r\nCarrigart Avenue, in the Lenadoon district of Belfast, on the evening\r\nof Friday 5 January 1990.  Once he was in that house, he was falsely\r\nimprisoned on the orders of the Provisional I.R.A. and was kept captive\r\nin one of the rear bedrooms of that house until the arrival of the\r\npolice and the army at the house on the afternoon of Sunday 7 January\r\n1990.  In addition to the false imprisonment of Mr. L., the Crown also\r\nmade the case that there was a conspiracy to murder him as punishment\r\nfor being a police informer.  The applicant was one of the people in\r\nthe house when the police entered on 7 January and rescued Mr. L.. At\r\nno time did the applicant give any explanation for his presence in that\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n      At the close of the prosecution case, the judge, acting in\r\naccordance with Article 4 of the Order, called upon each of the eight\r\naccused to give evidence in their own defence. The relevant part of\r\nArticle 4 of the Order provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"Accused to be called upon to give evidence at trial\r\n\r\n      4.   (1) At the trial of any person (other than a child) for an\r\n      offence paragraphs (2) to (7) apply unless\r\n\r\n      (a) the accused's guilt is not in issue, or\r\n\r\n      (b) it appears to the court that the physical or mental condition\r\n      of the accused makes it undesirable for him to be called upon to\r\n      give evidence;\r\n\r\n      but paragraph (2) does not apply if, before any evidence is\r\n      called for the defence, the accused or counsel or a solicitor\r\n      representing him informs the court that the accused will give\r\n      evidence.\r\n\r\n      (2) Before any evidence is called for the defence, the court\r\n\r\n      (a) shall tell the accused that he will be called upon by the\r\n      court to give evidence in his own defence, and\r\n\r\n      (b) shall tell him in ordinary language what the effect of this\r\n      Article will be if\r\n\r\n           (i) when so called upon, he refuses to be sworn;\r\n\r\n           (ii) having been sworn, without good cause he refuses to\r\n           answer any question;\r\n\r\n      and thereupon the court shall call upon the accused to give\r\n      evidence.\r\n\r\n      (3) If the accused\r\n\r\n      (a) after being called upon by the court to give evidence in\r\n      pursuance of this Article, or after he or counsel or a solicitor\r\n      representing him has informed the court that he will give\r\n      evidence, refuses to be sworn, or\r\n\r\n      (b) having been sworn, without good cause refuses to answer any\r\n      question, paragraph (4) applies.\r\n\r\n      (4) The court or jury, in determining whether the accused is\r\n      guilty of the offence charged, may\r\n\r\n      (a) draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper;\r\n\r\n      (b) on the basis of such inferences, treat the refusal as, or as\r\n      capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given\r\n      against the accused in relation to which the refusal is\r\n      material.\"\r\n\r\n      Acting on the advice of his solicitor and counsel, the applicant\r\nchose not to give any evidence.  No witnesses were called on the\r\napplicant's behalf. Counsel on his behalf, with some support from the\r\nevidence of a co-accused, submitted, inter alia, that the applicant's\r\npresence in the house just before the police arrived was recent and\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\n      In finding the applicant guilty of the sole offence of aiding and\r\nabetting the false imprisonment of L., the judge held as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"I now turn to consider the fifth count charging the false\r\n      imprisonment of L. against the accused <the applicant>.  For the\r\n      reasons which I have already stated, I am satisfied that, as L.\r\n      described in his evidence, <the applicant> was at the top of the\r\n      stairs pulling the tape out of the cassette after the police\r\n      arrived outside the house.\r\n\r\n      I am also satisfied, for the reasons which I have already stated,\r\n      that <the applicant> was in the house for longer than the short\r\n      period described by D.M..  I am further satisfied that it is an\r\n      irresistible inference that while he was in the house <the\r\n      applicant> was in contact with the men holding L. captive and\r\n      that he knew that L. was being held a captive.  I also draw very\r\n      strong inferences against <the applicant> under Article 6 of the\r\n      1988 Order by reason of his failure to give an account of his\r\n      presence in 124 when cautioned by the police on the evening of\r\n      7 January 1990 under Article 6, and I also draw very strong\r\n      inferences against <the applicant> under Article 4 of the 1988\r\n      Order by reason of his refusal to give evidence in his own\r\n      defence when called upon by the Court to do so.\r\n\r\n      Therefore I find <the applicant> guilty of aiding and abetting\r\n      the false imprisonment of L. because, knowing he was being held\r\n      captive in the house, he was present in the house concurring in\r\n      L. being falsely imprisoned.  As Vaughan J. stated in R. v. Young\r\n      8C and P 644 at 653, 173 ER 655 at 659 cited with approval by\r\n      Cave J. in R. v. Coney (1882) 8 QBD 534 at 541, <the applicant>\r\n      was 'near enough to give <his> aid and to give <his> countenance\r\n      and assistance.'\"\r\n\r\n      The applicant was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\n      The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the\r\nCourt of Appeal in Northern Ireland on the ground, inter alia, that the\r\njudge had erred in holding that the words of the Article 6 caution\r\nconformed with the requirement that an accused be told in ordinary\r\nlanguage what the effect would be if he failed or refused to account\r\nfor his presence at the scene of a crime.\r\n\r\n      In its judgment of 7 July 1992, the Court dismissed the\r\napplicant's appeal. It held, inter alia:\r\n\r\n      \"We consider that there was a formidable case against <the\r\n      applicant>. He was the only one of the accused whom <L.> observed\r\n      and identified as playing a positive part in the activities\r\n      touching his captivity. <L.>'s evidence therefore called for an\r\n      answer. No answer was forthcoming of any kind to the police or\r\n      throughout the length of his trial. It was inevitable that the\r\n      judge would draw \"very strong inferences\" against him.\"\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that he is the victim of a violation of\r\nArticle 6 paras. 1 and 2 and Article 14 of the Convention.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 16 August 1991 and registered\r\non 27 August 1991.\r\n\r\n      On 10 September 1992, the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the Government and to ask for written observations on\r\nthe admissibility and merits of the application.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 25 February 1993\r\nafter two extensions in the time-limit fixed for this purpose and the\r\napplicant's observations in reply were  submitted on 7 June 1993  after\r\none extension in the time-limit.\r\n\r\n      On 8 April 1993,  the Commission decided to grant legal aid to\r\nthe applicant.\r\n\r\n      On 30 August 1993, the Commission decided to invite the parties\r\nto an oral hearing.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing, which took place on 18 January 1994, the parties\r\nwere represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government\r\n\r\nMr. H. Llewellyn                 Agent\r\nMr. P. Coghlin Q.C.              Counsel\r\nMr. J. Eadie                     Counsel\r\n\r\nThree advisers were also present.\r\n\r\nFor the applicant\r\n\r\nMr. S. Treacy                    Counsel\r\nMr. K. Winters                   Solicitor, Madden and Finucane\r\nMs. K. Quinlivan                 Adviser\r\nMr. L. McStay                    Adviser\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that he was deprived of the right of\r\nsilence in the criminal proceedings brought against him as a result of\r\nthe operation of the provisions of the Criminal Evidence (Northern\r\nIreland) Order 1988 which permitted a judge, sitting without a jury,\r\nto draw inferences from his failure to answer police questions and from\r\nhis failure to give evidence in his own defence during the trial. He\r\nfurther complains that he was deprived of access to his solicitor in\r\nthe first 48 hours of his detention and that his solicitor was not\r\npermitted to be present during interviews which took place after that\r\ninitial period. The latter was in conformity with the practice in\r\nNorthern Ireland, which differs from that in England and Wales. The\r\napplicant invokes Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 and Article 14\r\n(Art. 6-1, 6-2, 14) of the Convention, which provide as relevant:\r\n\r\n      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1):\r\n\r\n      \"In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of\r\n      any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair\r\n      and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and\r\n      impartial tribunal established by law...\"\r\n\r\n      Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2):\r\n\r\n      \"Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed\r\n      innocent until proved guilty according to law.\"\r\n\r\n      Article 14 (Art. 14):\r\n\r\n      \"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this\r\n      Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground\r\n      such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other\r\n      opinion, national or social origin, association with a national\r\n      minority, property, birth or other status.\"\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the provisions of the 1988 Order did\r\nnot operate to deprive the applicant either of a fair hearing contrary\r\nto Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) or of the presumption of innocence\r\ncontrary Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2). They refer to the safeguards\r\nprovided in the Order: no inference may be drawn unless the\r\nsuspect/accused has been warned in advance of the possible effect;\r\nbefore any inference is drawn, the prosecution must have established\r\na prima facie case against the accused; the judge has a discretion\r\nwhether to draw an inference and is limited to drawing only such\r\ninferences as may be proper. The Order merely allows the trier of fact\r\nto draw such inferences as common sense dictates. In the present case,\r\nthere was a formidable case against the applicant which called for\r\nevidence from the applicant if there was an innocent explanation for\r\nhis conduct. The burden of proof remained throughout on the\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n      As regards the denial of access by the applicant to his solicitor\r\nfor 48 hours, the Government contend that this delay did not\r\ndisadvantage the applicant in the conduct of his defence and therefore\r\ndiscloses no violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention. Since\r\nthe police have similar powers to delay access in England and Wales,\r\nthey submit that there is no discrimination in this respect within the\r\nmeaning of Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      As regards the refusal of permission to the applicant's solicitor\r\nto be present during his interviews with the police, the Government\r\nstate that this too did not affect the conduct of the applicant's\r\ndefence and disclosed no violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention. The difference in this respect between the position in\r\nEngland and Wales and that in Northern Ireland, based as it was solely\r\non the geographical location at which a person was arrested and\r\ndetained, did not amount to discriminatory treatment within the meaning\r\nof Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that the 1988 Order, which permits\r\ninferences to be drawn from the failure of an accused to answer police\r\nquestions or to give evidence, and the reliance placed upon it by the\r\ntrial judge in the instant case, violate Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1)\r\nof the Convention.  The very strong inferences drawn by the trial judge\r\nin the applicant's case played a crucial role in his conviction. It is\r\nsubmitted that it is a generally recognised principle of international\r\nlaw that an accused person cannot be required to incriminate himself,\r\nthat Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention enshrines this principle, and\r\nthat the drawing of an incriminating inference from an accused's\r\nfailure to give evidence infringes his right to a fair trial.\r\n\r\n      The applicant also submits that the drawing of an incriminating\r\ninference from the failure of an accused person to give evidence has\r\nthe effect of placing the burden of proof on an accused and is\r\nmanifestly inconsistent with the presumption of innocence guaranteed\r\nin Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention. Further, the denial\r\nof access by the applicant to his solicitor for 48 hours and the\r\ndiscriminatory practice of not permitting solicitors to be present at\r\nany stage while a person arrested under prevention of terrorism\r\nprovisions is being interviewed, violates Article 6 (Art. 6) either\r\nalone or read in conjunction with Article 14 (Art. 6+14) of the\r\nConvention.  The discriminatory element derives, inter alia, from the\r\nfact that in England and Wales, contrary to the practice in Northern\r\nIreland, all detained persons, including those detained under\r\nprevention of terrorism legislation, are permitted to have their legal\r\nrepresentative present during the police interviews.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the\r\nparties. It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious\r\nissues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which\r\nshould depend on an examination of the merits. It follows that the\r\napplication cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded. No other\r\nground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission by a majority\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n      merits.\r\n\r\n",

        "text": "AS TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF\r\n\r\nApplication No. 17544/90\r\n\r\nby Anita RIBITSCH\r\nagainst Austria\r\n\r\nThe European Commission of Human Rights sitting in private on 4 May 1993, the following members being present:\r\n\r\nC.A. NØRGAARD, President\r\n\r\nTRECHSEL E. BUSUTTIL G. JÖRUNDSSON A.S. GÖZÜBÜYÜK A. WEITZEL J.-C. SOYER H.G. SCHERMERS\r\n\r\nDANELIUS\r\n\r\nF. MARTINEZ C.L. ROZAKIS\r\nL. LOUCAIDES J.-C. GEUS\r\nMARXER G.B. REFFI M.A. NOWICKI\r\n\r\nMr.\tH.C. KRÜGER, Secretary to the Commission\r\n\r\nHaving regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the application introduced on 3 August 1990 by Anita RIBITSCH against Austria and registered on 10 December 1990 under file No. 17544/90;\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the report provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\nHaving deliberated;\r\n\r\nDecides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The facts of the case, as they have been submitted by the\r\nparties, may be summarised as follows.\r\n\r\n      The applicant, born in 1958, is an Austrian national and resident\r\nin Vienna.  She is a nurse by profession.  Before the Commission she\r\nis represented by Mr. H. Pochieser, a lawyer practising in Vienna.\r\n\r\nA.    Particular circumstances of the case\r\n\r\na.    The investigations against the applicant and her husband\r\n\r\n      On 21 May 1988, in the context of criminal investigations\r\nconcerning the death of two persons due to opium poisoning, the\r\napplicant's and her husband's apartment was searched by police officers\r\nof the Vienna Federal Police Department (Bundespolizeidirektion).\r\n\r\n      On 31 May 1988, at 15 h., police officers of the Vienna Federal\r\nPolice Department arrested the applicant on the suspicion of drug\r\ntrafficking.  She asked her sister to take care of her two children,\r\nthen twelve and two years old.  Subsequent to her arrest, and again on\r\n1 and 2 June 1988 the spouses' apartment was searched.  The applicant\r\nand her husband were kept in police detention until the morning of\r\n2 June 1988.\r\n\r\n      She gives the following account of events in the course of her\r\ndetention:  After her arrest, her personal particulars were recorded.\r\nShe was then detained.  She was first questioned about the suspicion\r\nagainst her and her husband on 1 June 1988, at 12 h.  In the course of\r\nthe questioning, the police officers addressed the applicant in an\r\noverfamiliar way (\"duzen\"), and also insulted her (\"Kärntner Schwein\",\r\n\"du grande Dame, du\", \"du Trampel\", \"depate Alte\").  Upon her\r\nstatements concerning the charges, the police officers declared that\r\nher \"story would stink to high heaven\", that they \"would now put the\r\nscrew on her\", that they \"had lost their patience\".  The police\r\nofficers threatened her that her children would be taken into public\r\ncare.  As a result of this treatment, she was unfit for work for\r\nseveral days and had to undergo psychiatric treatment.\r\n\r\nb.    The proceedings before the Austrian Constitutional Court\r\n\r\n      On 28 September 1988 the applicant, assisted by counsel, lodged\r\na complaint under S. 144 of the Federal Constitution (Bundesver-\r\nfassungsgesetz) with the Austrian Constitutional Court (Verfassungs-\r\ngerichtshof) about her arrest on 31 May 1988 and subsequent detention,\r\nabout the searches of her home and about having been insulted by police\r\nofficers in the course of her detention.  In this respect, she\r\nrecounted in detail her version of events on the occasion of her\r\nquestioning and argued that the conduct of the police officers amounted\r\nto a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      On 28 November 1989 the Constitutional Court, upon the\r\napplicant's complaint, held that her arrest by police officers of the\r\nVienna Federal Police Department on 31 May 1988, and her subsequent\r\ndetention until 2 June 1988 had violated her right of liberty, and that\r\nthe searches of her home had violated her right to respect for her\r\nhome.  The Constitutional Court rejected the remainder of the\r\napplicant's complaint about having been insulted by police officers in\r\nthe course of her detention.\r\n\r\n      The Constitutional Court found that the applicant's arrest and\r\ndetention, which had not been ordered by a court, had been unlawful,\r\nas the Federal Police Department had failed to show any immediate\r\ndanger of collusion which could have justified a police action without\r\na warrant of arrest.  Likewise, the three searches of the applicant's\r\nhome had been carried out without a search warrant, no immediate danger\r\nexceptionally justifying such action.\r\n\r\n      As regards the alleged insults committed by police officers in\r\nthe course of the applicant's detention, the Constitutional Court\r\nreferred to its constant case-law according to which mere insults as\r\nsuch did not amount to an administrative act relating to the exercise\r\nof direct administrative authority and coercion, even if such insulting\r\nremarks were allegedly made in the course of an official act.  Thus\r\nthere was no act which could be challenged before the Constitutional\r\nCourt, and this part of the complaint was inadmissible.\r\n\r\n      The decision was served on 8 February 1990.\r\n\r\nc.    The criminal proceedings against police officers as regards the\r\n      alleged ill-treatment of the applicant's husband\r\n\r\n      The applicant's husband had, shortly after his release, raised\r\naccusations of ill-treatment against police officers involved in his\r\nand his wife's questioning, whereupon criminal proceedings had been\r\ninstituted against Police Officers M., T. and G.\r\n\r\n      On 13 October 1989 the Vienna District Court (Strafbezirks-\r\ngericht) convicted Police Officer M. of bodily assault (Körperver-\r\nletzung), and sentenced him to two months' imprisonment on probation.\r\nPolice Officers T. and G. were acquitted for lack of proof.  The Vienna\r\nDistrict Court found M. guilty of having beaten and kicked the\r\napplicant's husband and having pulled his hair and thereby caused\r\nhaematomas on his right upper arm as well as on his thigh and also a\r\ncervical syndrome.\r\n\r\n      On 14 September 1990 the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht),\r\nupon the appeal (Berufung) of Police Officer M., quashed the District\r\nCourt's judgment of 13 October 1989 and acquitted M.  The Regional\r\nCourt, having heard several witnesses and in particular taken recourse\r\nto expert evidence, found that, on balance, the version of the accused\r\ncould not be refuted, nor could at least parts of the allegations made\r\nby the applicant's husband be proven with the certainty necessary for\r\na criminal conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.    Relevant domestic law\r\n\r\n      S. 115 of the Austrian Penal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) provides in\r\nparticular that anyone who in public or in the presence of several\r\npersons insults, ridicules, or assaults another person or threatens him\r\nwith assault, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three\r\nmonths or a fine ..., if he is not liable to stricter punishment under\r\nanother provision.  Such an act is committed in the presence of several\r\npersons, if it is committed in the presence of more than three persons\r\nother than the offender and the victim, who could perceive the act\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n      According to S. 117 of the Penal Code, offences against the\r\nhonour are only prosecuted upon a charge by the victim concerned.  The\r\nvictim is entitled to bring private prosecution proceedings in\r\naccordance with SS. 2 and 46 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\r\n(Strafprozessordnung).\r\n\r\n      The competence of the Constitutional Court to receive complaints\r\nabout the violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights is laid down\r\nin S. 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundesverfassungs-\r\ngesetz), and relates to complaints against formal decisions of\r\nadministrative authorities or complaints concerning the exercise of\r\ndirect administrative authority and coercion against a particular\r\nindividual (Ausübung unmittelbarer verwaltungsbehördlicher Befehls- und\r\nZwangsgewalt gegen eine bestimmte Person).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains that her arrest and detention, in\r\nparticular the insulting remarks by police officers in the course of\r\nher detention, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to\r\nArticle 3 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n2.    Furthermore, the applicant complains under Article 13, in\r\nconjunction with Article 3 of the Convention, that in the proceedings\r\nbefore the Austrian Constitutional Court she could not effectively\r\nlodge her complaints about ill-treatment by police officers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 3 August 1990 and registered\r\non 10 December 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 30 March 1992 the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the respondent Government for observations on the\r\nadmissibility and merits.\r\n\r\n      On 15 July 1992, after an extension of the time-limit, the\r\nGovernment submitted their observations.  The observations in reply by\r\nthe applicant were submitted on 8 October 1992.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains that, in the course of her arrest and\r\ndetention, police officers subjected her to ill-treatment, in\r\nparticular in the form of insulting remarks, contrary to Article 3\r\n(Art. 3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention provides that no one shall\r\nbe subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n      The Government maintain that the applicant failed, as required\r\nby Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, to exhaust the domestic\r\nremedies at her disposal under Austrian law.  They submit in particular\r\nthat the applicant did not bring private prosecution proceedings\r\nagainst the police officers concerned for insult within the meaning of\r\nS. 115 of the Penal Code.  They further consider that she failed\r\nproperly to reason her constitutional complaint as regards the alleged\r\ninsults so as to enable the Constitutional Court to assume its\r\ncompetence to entertain this complaint.\r\n\r\n      The applicant considers that her ill-treatment amounted to bodily\r\nassault which had to be prosecuted ex officio and therefore could not\r\nbe the subject of private prosecution proceedings.  Furthermore, she\r\ncontends that in her complaint to the Constitutional Court she had in\r\ndetail recounted the events and their consequences.\r\n\r\n      According to Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, the\r\nCommission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies\r\nhave been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of\r\ninternational law.\r\n\r\n      The Commission observes that the basis of the rule of exhaustion\r\nof domestic remedies under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention is\r\nthat, before proceedings are brought in an international court, the\r\nstate made answerable must have had an opportunity to redress the\r\nalleged damage by domestic means within the framework of its own legal\r\nsystem (cf. No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57).  In respect of\r\nalleged ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention,\r\nthe Commission has held that raising criminal charges against the\r\nofficials concerned or filing a civil action for compensation are\r\neffective remedies to be exhausted pursuant to Article 26 (Art. 26)\r\n(No. 11208/84, Dec. 4.3.86, D.R. 46 p. 182; No. 10078/82, Dec.\r\n13.12.84, D.R. 41 p. 103; No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57).\r\n\r\n      In the present case, the applicant did not bring private\r\nprosecution proceedings against the police officers concerned for\r\ninsult, or, assuming that the alleged acts had to be prosecuted ex\r\nofficio, lay any criminal charges against the police officers\r\nrequesting their prosecution.  In this context, the Commission had\r\nregard to the criminal proceedings instituted against three police\r\nofficers upon accusations of ill-treatment raised by the applicant's\r\nhusband, which the applicant's husband joined as a private party\r\nclaiming compensation.  In the course of these proceedings, the\r\nallegations of the applicant's husband were carefully examined at two\r\ncourt levels.\r\n\r\n      The applicant did not institute civil proceedings either, with\r\na view to claiming compensation in particular as regards the alleged\r\ndetrimental consequences of the events in question.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that the applicant, in her complaint to the\r\nAustrian Constitutional Court lodged almost four months after the\r\nrelevant incidents, also referred to the alleged insults, arguing\r\nill-treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.  The\r\ncompetence of the Constitutional Court to receive complaints about the\r\nviolation of constitutionally guaranteed rights is limited under S. 144\r\npara. 1 of the Federal Constitution to formal decisions of\r\nadministrative authorities or the exercise of direct administrative\r\nauthority and coercion against a particular individual.  The\r\nConstitutional Court, in its decision of 28 November 1989, declared the\r\napplicant's complaint about the alleged insults committed by police\r\nofficers in the course of her detention inadmissible in accordance with\r\nits constant case-law, according to which mere insults as such did not\r\namount to an administrative act relating to the exercise of direct\r\nadministrative authority and coercion, even if such insulting remarks\r\nwere allegedly made in the course of an official act.\r\n\r\n      In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's\r\ncomplaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not\r\nconstitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of\r\nexhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26)\r\nof the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant's submissions do not disclose any special\r\ncircumstance which might have absolved her according to the generally\r\nrecognised rules of international law from exhausting the effective\r\ndomestic remedies at her disposal.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the application must be rejected\r\nunder Article 27 para. 3 in conjunction with Article 26 (Art. 27-3+26)\r\nof the Convention.\r\n\r\n2.    Furthermore, the applicant complains under Article 13 (Art. 13),\r\nin conjunction with Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, that in the\r\nproceedings before the Austrian Constitutional Court she could not\r\neffectively lodge her complaint about ill-treatment by police officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Commission refers to its above findings that under Austrian\r\nlaw, the applicant could have brought criminal charges against the\r\npolice officers concerned, or filed a civil action for compensation as\r\nregards the alleged detrimental consequences of the events for her\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded within\r\nthe meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission by a majority\r\n\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.\r\n\r\n",

SVÁBY\r\n\r\n\r\n           Mr.   K. ROGGE, Secretary to the Chamber\r\n\r\n      Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection\r\nof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the application introduced on 16 November 1992\r\nby Ove, Bengt, Bertil and Inkeri GUSTAVSSON against Sweden and\r\nregistered on 30 November 1992 under file No. 21009/92;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules\r\nof Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n      Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n      Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The first applicant, Mr. Ove Gustavsson, is a technician born in\r\n1960 and resident at Partille. He is the father and sole guardian of\r\nthe second applicant, Bengt Gustavsson, born in 1984 and also resident\r\nat Partille. The third and the fourth applicant, Mr. and Mrs. Bertil\r\nand Inkeri Gustavsson, are the first applicant's parents, born in 1933\r\nand 1932, respectively. The third applicant is an industrial supervisor\r\nand the fourth applicant is a child nurse. They are both resident at\r\nLandvetter. All applicants are Swedish citizens, but the fourth\r\napplicant is of Finnish origin. They are all represented by Mrs. Siv\r\nWesterberg, a lawyer in Gothenburg.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants or apparent\r\nfrom the documents, may be summarised as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n      In September 1986 S., the wife of the first applicant and the\r\nmother of the second applicant, died of cancer. Prior to S.'s death and\r\nalso subsequently the second applicant was to a significant extent\r\ncared for by the third and the fourth applicant.\r\n\r\n      In August 1989 the second applicant was enrolled at a day\r\nnursery. It appears that towards the end of 1990 he was observed\r\nplaying sexually explicit games with other children in his day nursery.\r\nIt further appears that he stated in an interview in private with the\r\nnursery manager that he had played similar \"games\" also with his\r\nfather. On 20 December 1990 the nursery manager informed the Social\r\nOffice (socialkontoret) of Partille of her suspicions that the second\r\napplicant had been sexually abused by the first applicant.\r\n\r\n      According to the applicants, the second applicant had been led\r\nby the nursery manager to state that \"games\" had taken place together\r\nwith the first applicant. Allegedly, the second applicant subsequently\r\nasserted that he had only played the \"games\" with his friend at school\r\nand never with the first applicant. Certain allegations made by the\r\nnursery manager concerning the second applicant's behaviour in the\r\nnursery were said to be based on second-hand or third-hand information\r\nfrom other children in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 9 January 1991 the Social Office lodged a complaint with the\r\npolice suspecting the first applicant of having sexually abused the\r\nsecond applicant. On 21 January 1991 the first applicant was\r\ninterrogated by the police on this suspicion. He was arrested and on\r\n22 January 1991 detained, but was released on 28 January 1991. He was\r\nfurther ordered to refrain from contacting his son during the pre-trial\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n      On 21 January 1991 a police officer interviewed the second\r\napplicant on videotape. Meanwhile, during a search carried out in the\r\nfirst applicant's home some pornographic magazines and video cassettes\r\nwere seized.     On 21 January 1991 the fourth applicant was informed\r\nby social welfare officials of the suspicions against the first\r\napplicant. She was prohibited from taking the second applicant to her\r\nhome. Instead he was taken to the home of the nursery manager. On\r\n28 January 1991 he was placed in public care in a so-called \"family\r\nhome\" (familjehem). During this period he was not allowed to see any\r\nof the other applicants.\r\n\r\n      On 4 February 1991 the District Court (tingsrätten) of Mölndal\r\nordered that the second applicant should undergo a psychiatric\r\nexamination by Ms. Monica Ekberg, a psychologist and psychotherapist\r\nspecialised in child and witness psychology and whom the Court itself\r\nhad called as an expert. On 23 February and 2 March 1991 Ms. Ekberg\r\ninterviewed him in the \"family home\". In her report of 4 April 1991\r\nMs. Ekberg considered the boy to be credible and his account of sexual\r\nacts together with his father to be trustworthy, although with a\r\ncertain reservation.\r\n\r\n      In a report of 15 May 1991 Dr. Mats Pihlgren, a psychologist of\r\nthe Child and Youth Psychiatric Centre (barn- och ungdomspsykiatriska\r\nmottagningen) of Partille recommended that the second applicant should\r\nundergo individual therapy. In a report of 19 June 1991 Mr. Robert S.\r\nJerdén, a psychologist and psychotherapist, refuted the conclusions of\r\nMs. Ekberg of 4 April 1991 on the ground that her investigation\r\nmaterial had been insufficient. For instance, no interviews had been\r\ncarried out with part of the nursery staff and the second applicant's\r\nday carer at the time of the suspected offences. Mr. Jerdén concluded\r\nthat the first applicant could not have - and had not - committed the\r\noffences with which he had been charged.\r\n\r\n      On 19 July 1991 the District Court held an oral hearing. In the\r\nprosecution's written indictment the first applicant had been charged\r\nwith having sexually abused the second applicant \"on several occasions\r\nduring 1990, [the second applicant] being 5-6 years old\". At the main\r\nhearing before the District Court the indictment was amended, the first\r\napplicant now being charged with having sexually abused the second\r\napplicant \"on several occasions during the years 1987-90, [the second\r\napplicant] being 3-6 years old\".\r\n\r\n      Before the District Court the prosecution invoked the videotape\r\nof the interview with the second applicant on 21 January 1991 which was\r\napparently shown to the Court. On the prosecution's request the nursery\r\nmanager was heard as a witness. Ms. Ekberg was heard as an expert. The\r\nprosecution further invoked the report of 4 April 1991 by Ms. Ekberg,\r\na report by Mr. Pihlgren as well as a report by Dr. Margit Möller, a\r\nphysician specialised in child and youth psychiatry, of the Child and\r\nYouth Psychiatric Centre. Finally, the prosecution invoked photographs\r\nof the material seized in the first applicant's home.\r\n\r\n      On the first applicant's request Mr. Jerdén was heard as an\r\nexpert. The first applicant also invoked a written report submitted by\r\nMr. Jerdén. Three staff members of the nursery, a nurse at the Child\r\nand Youth Psychiatric Clinic as well as the fourth applicant were heard\r\nas witnesses. The first applicant's request that the second applicant's\r\nday carer be heard as a witness was apparently rejected.\r\n\r\n      The District Court, by a majority, convicted the first applicant\r\nof, inter alia, sexual abuse of a minor and sentenced him to one year's\r\nimprisonment. It noted that the indictment had been exclusively based\r\non information given by the second applicant and considered, inter\r\nalia, that the evidential value of the police interview with the second\r\napplicant on 21 January 1991 was diminished by leading questions. The\r\nDistrict Court had not listened to the tape from Ms. Ekberg's first\r\ninterview with the second applicant. It found no reason, however, to\r\nquestion Ms. Ekberg's report and further noted that in a further\r\ninterview on 29 April 1991 conducted by Mr. Pihlgren the second\r\napplicant had again referred to sexual contacts between him and the\r\nfirst applicant. For the Court, it was beyond reasonable doubt that the\r\nfirst applicant had \"at least on some occasions\" abused the second\r\napplicant sexually. One lay judge dissented.\r\n\r\n      In his appeal the applicant challenged the accuracy of\r\nMs. Ekberg's report from which the District Court had allegedly drawn\r\nincorrect conclusions. He further complained that Ms. Ekberg had failed\r\nto record her interviews with the second applicant and repeated his\r\nrequest that the second applicant's day carer at the time of the\r\nsuspected offences be heard as witness.\r\n\r\n      On 22 October 1991 a report on a psychiatric examination of the\r\nfirst applicant was received by the Court of Appeal (hovrätten) of\r\nWestern Sweden. On 30 January 1992 the Court of Appeal heard experts\r\nEkberg and Jerdén as well as all witnesses heard by the District Court\r\nexcept the nurse at the Child and Youth Psychiatric Centre. The Court\r\nof Appeal also viewed the videotape of the police interview with the\r\napplicant on 21 January 1991. As further evidence the prosecution\r\ninvoked a report of 11 December 1991 by Mr. Pihlgren, whom the second\r\napplicant had visited once a week as from June 1991 for therapy. Mr.\r\nPihlgren concluded that the second applicant was entirely fixated on\r\nsexual acts, in particular between a child and its father. On the first\r\napplicant's request the second applicant's day carer at the time of the\r\nsuspected offences was heard as a new witness before the Court of\r\nAppeal. She had not noticed any disturbances in the second applicant's\r\nbehaviour until the middle of 1991.\r\n\r\n      In its judgment of 30 January 1992 the Court of Appeal confirmed\r\nthe first applicant's conviction. It found Mr. Pihlgren's report of\r\nDecember 1991 not decisive, since it was impossible to distinguish\r\nbetween acts experienced by the second applicant and imaginative acts\r\nprovoked by his therapy.\r\n\r\n      In his request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Högsta\r\ndomstolen) the applicant complained that his conviction was mainly\r\nbased on Ms. Ekberg's expert report, although this report had been\r\nchallenged by the other expert Mr. Jerdén. Moreover, as pressure had\r\nbeen put on the second applicant during the interviews conducted by the\r\nnursery manager and the police officer, these interviews could not be\r\ndecisive either. The first applicant further referred to the testimony\r\nby the second applicant's day carer and finally recalled the Court of\r\nAppeal's disregard of Mr. Pihlgren's report of December 1991.\r\n\r\n      On 2 June 1992 the Supreme Court refused the first applicant\r\nleave to appeal.\r\n\r\n      On 15 September 1994 the first applicant requested a re-opening\r\nof the criminal proceedings, arguing that he had not been provided with\r\nan opportunity to challenge the videotaped police interview with the\r\nsecond applicant by questioning him at the hearings before the District\r\nCourt and the Court of Appeal. On 14 November 1994 the Supreme Court\r\nrefused to re-open the case.\r\n\r\n      Before the Commission the applicants invoke a report and appendix\r\nof 5 and 21 January 1993, respectively, by Dr. Rudolf Schlaug, a\r\nspecialist in general psychiatry, finding it unlikely that the second\r\napplicant has been sexually abused.\r\n\r\n      3.   The second applicant's placement in public care and the\r\n           conditions in the \"family homes\"\r\n\r\n      On 21 January 1991 the Chairman of the Social Council\r\n(socialnämnden) of Partille decided in pursuance of Section 6 of the\r\n1990 Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons (lag\r\n1990:52 med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga; hereinafter \"the\r\n1990 Act\") to place the second applicant in provisional public care.\r\nThis order was revoked on 25 January 1991, when the second applicant\r\nwas placed in a \"family home\" at Hällingsjö with the first applicant's\r\nconsent in pursuance of Section 6 and 22 of the 1980 Social Services\r\nAct (socialtjänstlag 1980:620). It appears that he subsequently\r\nwithdrew his consent, objecting to the manner in which the public care\r\nwas being implemented.\r\n\r\n      On 14 May 1991 Dr. Möller requested the Social Council to\r\nurgently investigate whether it would be preferable to implement the\r\npublic care in the third and the fourth applicant's home rather than\r\nin a \"family home\".\r\n\r\n      On 16 May 1991 the Social Council decided in pursuance of Section\r\n1, subsection 2, Section 2 and Section 11 of the 1990 Act to request\r\nthe second applicant's placement in compulsory public care and to\r\nmaintain his placement in the \"family home\" at Hällingsjö.\r\n\r\n      On 20 June 1991 the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of\r\nGothenburg and Bohus held an oral hearing and granted the request with\r\nimmediate effect. The Court took account of, inter alia, the indictment\r\nagainst the first applicant. The first applicant appealed to the\r\nAdministrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) of Gothenburg.\r\n\r\n      On 25 July 1991 the Social Council decided to transfer the second\r\napplicant to another \"family home\" at Partille.\r\n\r\n      On 20 September 1991 the Administrative Court of Appeal struck\r\nthe first applicant's appeal off its list of cases after he had\r\nwithdrawn it. According to the applicants, the appeal was withdrawn\r\nafter counsel had stated that it lacked any prospect of success.\r\n\r\n      On 17 October 1991 the Care Subcommittee (vårdutskottet) of the\r\nSocial Council rejected the third and the fourth applicant's request\r\nunder Section 25 of the Social Services Act that they be allowed to\r\npermanently care for the second applicant in their home. One member\r\ndissented, noting that the third and the fourth applicant had cared for\r\nthe second applicant to up to 70 per cent of his time after he had\r\nreached the age of eight months. The investigating official of the\r\nCommittee had not visited the third and the fourth applicant in their\r\nhome. The third and the fourth applicant did not appeal against this\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n      On 30 December 1991 the Social Council considered that the second\r\napplicant was still in need of public care and approved a care plan for\r\nthe period from 1 January to 30 June 1992. On 21 May 1992 the Social\r\nCouncil maintained his public care and approved a care plan for the\r\nperiod 1 July to 31 December 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 5 October 1992 the first applicant requested that the second\r\napplicant's care be terminated and that he be cared for by the third\r\nand the fourth applicant in their home, alternatively that the public\r\ncare be implemented in the third and the fourth applicant's home. On\r\n7 October 1992 the Social Council adjourned its decision until it had\r\nreviewed the second applicant's care need ex officio in pursuance of\r\nSection 13 of the 1990 Act.\r\n\r\n      On 17 December 1992 the Social Council maintained the second\r\napplicant's public care. The first applicant's appeal to the County\r\nAdministrative Court was rejected on 13 May 1993 following an oral\r\nhearing at which the third and the fourth applicant as well as the\r\nfirst applicant's two sisters were heard as witnesses. The witnesses\r\nstated that following his taking into public care the second\r\napplicant's development had slowed down and he had become introvert.\r\nFurthermore he had not been properly washed and dressed by his\r\nsubstitute parents. On one occasion his substitute father had lost him\r\nin a crowd.\r\n\r\n      In its judgment the County Administrative Court noted a report\r\nby Mr. Pihlgren of 26 November 1992, according to which the second\r\napplicant was still in need of therapy. The other applicants opposed\r\nthe therapy provided by Mr. Pihlgren. The Court considered that, while\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant were generally suitable as carers,\r\nthe implementation of the second applicant's public care in their home\r\ncould lead to a conflict of interests, given their objections to the\r\ntherapy provided as well as their belief that the first applicant had\r\nnot committed the offences of which he had been convicted. The Court\r\nfurther found that the criticism of the conditions in the second\r\napplicant's \"family home\" was not corroborated by the witness\r\nstatements nor by the investigation by the Social Council.\r\n\r\n      In his appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammar-\r\nrätten) of Gothenburg the first applicant criticised, inter alia, the\r\nsecond applicant's hygiene and clothing in the \"family home\".\r\n\r\n      The appeal was rejected on 15 September 1993. The Administrative\r\nCourt of Appeal noted a report by Mr. Pihlgren of 23 August 1993,\r\naccording to which the second applicant was still in need of therapy.\r\nThe criticism of the conditions in the \"family home\" had been refuted\r\nby the Social Council and the second applicant's official counsel.\r\n\r\n      Leave to appeal was refused to the first applicant on 26 May 1994\r\nby the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten).\r\n\r\n      Throughout the care proceedings the second applicant was\r\nrepresented by his official counsel, who supported the Social Council's\r\nview that public care away from the second applicant's biological\r\nfamily was still needed. According to the applicants, however, it has\r\nbeen the second applicant's consistent wish to live either with the\r\nfirst applicant or with the third and the fourth applicant.\r\n\r\n      4.   Access to the second applicant\r\n\r\n      Having been released from detention on 28 January 1991, the first\r\napplicant was prohibited by a social welfare official from taking the\r\nsecond applicant home. His request that the second applicant be allowed\r\nto stay with the third and the fourth applicant was also refused.\r\n\r\n      It appears from a report by officials of the Social Council of\r\n11 April 1991 that during the first two months following the second\r\napplicant's placement in public care in the first \"family home\" the\r\nthird and the fourth applicant visited him there at least every\r\nweekend. As from 18 March 1991 they were allowed to bring him to their\r\nhome to spend the weekends there. On 18 March 1991 the first applicant\r\nvisited the second applicant in the \"family home\" for the first time\r\nafter his release. Subsequently the two met in the third and the fourth\r\napplicant's home. They were not allowed, however, to meet in private\r\neither there or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n      According to the care plan approved by the Social Council on\r\n21 May 1992, the first applicant was to spend one weekend a month with\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant and another weekend with his\r\nmaternal grandparents. The first applicant and other relatives of the\r\nsecond applicant were allowed to visit the second applicant during\r\nthose weekends. The first applicant was not allowed to see the second\r\napplicant in private on those occasions. He was, however, allowed to\r\nvisit the second applicant in the \"family home\" for two hours every\r\nsecond week or a maximum of two to three visits a month. The third and\r\nthe fourth applicant could further see the second applicant outside the\r\n\"family home\" one afternoon a month. If the second applicant's other\r\nrelatives would be unable to see him during the above weekends, they\r\ncould arrange other meetings either in or outside the \"family home\" in\r\nagreement with the substitute parents. On special holidays the second\r\napplicant was allowed to see the first applicant and other relatives\r\nsubject to consultation with the social welfare officer in charge. The\r\nsecond applicant was to continue his weekly therapy for another year.\r\nThe care plan was to be revised in six months. The first applicant was\r\nnotified of his right of appeal to the County Administrative Court\r\nagainst the restrictions on his access to the second applicant as\r\nindicated in the care plan. He did not avail himself of this\r\npossibility. Nor has he challenged the subsequent care plans, allegedly\r\nfearing retaliation measures by the Social Council such as further\r\naccess restrictions. The third and the fourth applicant have no legal\r\nstanding for the purpose of requesting access.\r\n\r\n      It appears that presently the second applicant is allowed to see\r\nthe first applicant for two hours every second week in the \"family\r\nhome\". The second applicant is allowed to spend one weekend a month in\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant's home and another weekend in the\r\nhome of his maternal grandparents.\r\n\r\n      5.   The first and the second applicant's obligation to\r\n           participate in the costs incurred by the public care of the\r\n           second applicant\r\n\r\n      On 23 August 1991 the Guardianship Board (överförmyndarnämnden)\r\nof Partille requested that the first applicant generally authorise, in\r\nhis capacity as the second applicant's guardian, the substitute parents\r\nto withdraw money from an account opened by the Board for the purpose\r\nof collecting the second applicant's national supplementary insurance\r\n(allmän tilläggspension). Subject to the Board's approval, such\r\nwithdrawals could be made for purchases for the second applicant. The\r\nfirst applicant signed such an authority, allegedly fearing further\r\naccess restrictions.\r\n\r\n      According to the applicants, the furniture in the second\r\napplicant's room in the present \"family home\" has de facto been paid\r\nfor by the second applicant himself by virtue of the collection of his\r\nvarious pension benefits. The same is allegedly true for clothing and\r\nother necessities, although such expenses are to be covered by a\r\nmonthly compensatory lump sum paid by the Social Council to the\r\nsubstitute parents.\r\n\r\n      6.   The education provided to the second applicant\r\n\r\n      At the time of his placement in public care the second applicant\r\nwas entitled to attend so-called preschool (förskola) for three hours\r\na day. After the placement the first applicant requested that the\r\nsecond applicant be allowed to attend such classes, but this was\r\nallegedly refused by the social authorities and the substitute parents.\r\nAs from the autumn of 1991 the second applicant is attending elementary\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n      7.   The courts' refusals to communicate documents to the first\r\n           applicant\r\n\r\n      On 24 September 1992 the first applicant requested access to the\r\nDistrict Court's confidential documents in the criminal proceedings\r\nagainst him, including the videotape and the audiotape from the\r\nhearing. The request was granted on 16 October 1992 on condition that\r\nthe material only be used in domestic proceedings. The first applicant\r\nappealed, invoking his intention to use the requested documents and\r\nmaterial before the Convention organs. The District Court's decision\r\nwas upheld by the Court of Appeal on 11 December 1992. On 29 October\r\n1993, however, the Supreme Court granted the first applicant's further\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n      8.   The courts' refusals to accept the applicants' present\r\n           counsel as the first applicant's official counsel\r\n\r\n      On 20 October 1992 the County Administrative Court refused the\r\nfirst applicant's request that his counsel before the Commission be\r\nappointed official counsel in proceedings with a view to having the\r\nsecond applicant's public care terminated. The Court considered that\r\nshe did not fulfil the requirements of suitability in Section 44 of the\r\n1972 Legal Aid Act (rättshjälpslag 1972:429). The first applicant\r\nappealed, invoking, inter alia, Article 25 para. 1 of the Convention\r\nand stated his unwillingness to be represented by any other counsel.\r\nThe appeal was rejected on 2 December 1992. Leave to appeal was refused\r\nby the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 May 1994.\r\n\r\nII.   Relevant domestic law\r\n\r\n      A young person may be placed in public care inter alia if, due\r\nto physical abuse, exploitation, deficiencies of care or some other\r\ncircumstances in his or her home, there is a clear risk of the young\r\nperson's health and development being impaired (Section 1, subsection\r\n2 as well as Section 2 of the 1990 Act). In certain situations a\r\nprovisional care order may be issued (Section 6). The care order does\r\nnot imply a transfer of custody or guardianship to the Social Council,\r\nsuch a transfer requiring specific court decisions (see Chapters 6 and\r\n10 of the Parental Code (föräldrabalken)).\r\n\r\n      The Social Council decides how the public care of the young\r\nperson is to be implemented and where he or she is to reside during the\r\ncare period. The Council may consent to the young person residing in\r\nhis or her own home, if this may be presumed to be the most appropriate\r\nway of arranging public care, but such care is always to commence away\r\nfrom home (Section 11). An appeal may be lodged against a decision of\r\nthe Social Council if it has, inter alia, decided where the care of the\r\nyoung person is to commence, if it has transferred him or her to\r\nanother home or if it has decided a question relating to continued care\r\n(Section 41). A decision not to transfer a child from a \"family home\"\r\nis also appealable (Government Bill 1989/90:28, p. 125).\r\n\r\n      Under the 1980 Social Services Act the Social Council may also\r\nconsent to a child's placement in a private home other than that of one\r\nor both of its parents or another custodian. A refusal of such consent\r\nmay be appealed to the administrative courts (Sections 25 and 73).\r\n\r\n      According to the 1981 Social Services Ordinance (social-\r\ntjänstförordning 1981:750), the Social Council shall carefully monitor\r\nthe young person's development in the \"family home\" where it has been\r\nplaced (Section 39). This monitoring shall be carried out through\r\nregular visits in the \"family home\" and by hearing the child. Telephone\r\ncalls to the substitute parents are deemed unsatisfactory in order to\r\ncomply with this responsibility (Government Bill 1989/90:28, p. 113).\r\nIf care has been provided under Section 2, the Council must at least\r\nevery six months review whether care is still necessary (Section 13 of\r\nthe 1990 Act).\r\n\r\n       It is primarily for the parents to ensure that their child's\r\nneed of access to a person who is particularly close to it is satisfied\r\nto the utmost possible extent (Chapter 6, Section 15, subsection 1 of\r\nthe Parental Code). If a young person is placed in public care the\r\nSocial Council shall ensure, as far as possible, his or her access to\r\nparents or other custodians. If necessary in view of the purpose of the\r\npublic care the Council may decide, inter alia, how access may be\r\nexercised (Section 14 of the 1990 Act). The contacts between the child\r\nand its parents should not be completely cut off and the public care\r\nshould not continue for any longer than necessary. The Council shall\r\npromote contacts between the child and others who are close to it. The\r\nCouncil may not restrict access between the child and its parents\r\nwithout there being strong reasons therefor, e.g., when the parents\r\ninterfere with the care or when their personal conditions are such that\r\nthey should not have access. Restrictions on access shall be lifted\r\nimmediately when they are no longer needed and shall be re-examined by\r\nthe Council every three months (cf. Government Bill 1989/90:28, pp. 72\r\net seq.).  Under Swedish law grandparents have no right of access to\r\na grandchild.\r\n\r\n      The individual concerned shall be informed of the notes\r\nconcerning him or her kept by the Social Council (Section 52 of the\r\nSocial Services Act). In proceedings before the administrative courts\r\nthe parties shall normally be heard in regard to submissions by another\r\nparty (Section 18 of the 1971 Code of Administrative Procedure\r\n(förvaltningsprocesslag 1971:291)).\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n1.    The first applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention\r\nthat the criminal proceedings leading to his conviction were not\r\nconducted before an impartial District Court and Court of Appeal and\r\nthat the proceedings were unfair and contrary to the presumption of\r\ninnocence. The following is alleged:\r\n\r\n      (a) the nursery manager's interview with the second applicant was\r\nnot conducted by professionals especially trained to handle incest\r\nsuspicions;\r\n\r\n      (b) the interview was carried out in the absence of the first\r\napplicant;\r\n\r\n      (c) the second applicant should have been assisted by a legal\r\nrepresentative during the interview;\r\n\r\n      (d) the police interview with the second applicant was not\r\nattended by the first applicant himself or his lawyer;\r\n\r\n      (e) at this interview the police officer used terms which the\r\nsecond applicant was unfamiliar with and, moreover, asked him leading\r\nquestions;\r\n\r\n      (f) following the interview the second applicant was kept by the\r\nnursery manager for seven days during which period he was not allowed\r\nto see any of the other applicants, this being likely to influence his\r\naccount of the suspected sexual abuse;\r\n\r\n      (g) the audio tape from Ms. Ekberg's interview with the second\r\napplicant on 23 February 1991 was destroyed before the first applicant\r\nfound out about its existence, thus preventing him from challenging its\r\ncontents;\r\n\r\n      (h) Ms. Ekberg's interviews were conducted long after the second\r\napplicant had been separated from the other applicants and thus had\r\nbeen subjected to influence by the nursery manager;\r\n\r\n      (i) the District Court's acceptance of the amendment of the\r\nindictment at the main hearing did not afford the first applicant\r\nadequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence;\r\n\r\n      (j) the first applicant remained unaware of a significant number\r\nof relevant documents submitted to the District Court by the\r\nprosecution (i.e. records from interrogations with nursery staff\r\nrefuting the incest suspicions, interrogation records showing\r\ndiscrepancies in some of the witness statements, a medical report\r\nfinding no physical injuries on the second applicant, etc.);\r\n\r\n      (k) the District Court did not ex officio communicate the above\r\ndocuments to the first applicant for comments;\r\n\r\n      (l) the videotape from the police interview with the second\r\napplicant was viewed at the District Court's and the Court of Appeal's\r\nhearings, but the first applicant had not been provided with a copy in\r\nadvance and was thus denied adequate time and facilities for the\r\npreparation of his defence;\r\n\r\n      (m) the second applicant was not heard by the District Court;\r\n\r\n      (n) Mr. Pihlgren was partial in the criminal proceedings, since\r\nit was in his pecuniary interests to secure the first applicant's\r\nconviction in order to be able to pursue his therapy sessions with the\r\nsecond applicant;\r\n\r\n      (o) the first applicant's conviction was not based on any\r\nforensic or \"impartial\" evidence; and\r\n\r\n      (p) the first applicant was not informed about the report on his\r\npsychiatric examination until the Court of Appeal's hearing.\r\n\r\n2.    The first applicant further complains that his conviction also\r\nviolated Article 3 of the Convention in that it led to the maintaining\r\nof the second applicant's placement in public care.\r\n\r\n3.    The first and the second applicant complain that the first\r\napplicant was prohibited from taking the second applicant home on his\r\nrelease from his pre-trial detention, this prohibition violating the\r\nfirst applicant's rights under Article 6 para. 2 of the Convention as\r\nwell both applicants' rights under Article 8.\r\n\r\n4.    The third and the fourth applicant complain under Articles 6 and\r\n13 of the Convention about lack of a court remedy enabling them to\r\nchallenge the refusal to allow them to care for the second applicant\r\nduring the pre-trial investigation. The second applicant also complains\r\nthat the refusal violated his rights under Article 10 of the Convention\r\nto receive information, while the third and the fourth applicant\r\ncomplain that the refusal violated their rights under Article 10 of the\r\nConvention to freedom of expression.\r\n\r\n5.    The third and the fourth applicant complain under Article 6 of\r\nthe Convention that they were unable to refute the suspicions expressed\r\nby an official of the Social Council that they might sexually abuse the\r\nsecond applicant.\r\n\r\n6.    The second applicant complains under Article 7 of the Convention\r\nthat his placement in public care amounts to a punishment without any\r\nlegal basis.\r\n\r\n7.    All applicants complain under Article 8 of the Convention that\r\nthe second applicant's public care, in particular in a \"family home\",\r\nhas not been and is not justified, given the ability of the third and\r\nthe fourth applicant to care for the second applicant, should his\r\npublic care be terminated or implemented in their home. They invoke\r\nArticle 8 of the Convention. In their submission of 15 March 1994 the\r\nthird and the fourth applicant also complain under Article 9 of the\r\nConvention that the decisions complained of were taken in view of their\r\nopinion that the first applicant is innocent.8.   The second applicant\r\ncomplains under Article 3 of the Convention of the conditions in the\r\nfirst \"family home\". Moreover, contrary to Articles 6 and 13 of the\r\nConvention, he had no court remedy whereby he could have challenged\r\nthese conditions.\r\n\r\n9.    The second applicant further complains under Article 5 of the\r\nConvention of his placement in public care in the second \"family home\",\r\ngiven the restrictions on his right to see the other applicants.\r\n\r\n10.   The first applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention\r\nthat his request of 5 October 1992 for a termination of the second\r\napplicant's public care, alternatively that the care be implemented in\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant's home, was not examined by a court\r\nwithin a reasonable time because the Social Council adjourned its\r\nexamination of this request.\r\n\r\n11.   The third and the fourth applicant complain under Article 13 of\r\nthe Convention about lack of a court remedy against the refusal to\r\nallow them to become the second applicant's foster parents pursuant to\r\nthe Social Services Act.\r\n\r\n12.   In the submissions of 15 March 1994 the first applicant complains\r\nunder Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention that he has no court remedy\r\nat his disposal against the implementation of the second applicant's\r\npublic care.\r\n\r\n13.   The first and the second applicant complain under Article 8 of\r\nthe Convention that the access restrictions concerning them have no\r\nbasis in domestic law and are not necessary.\r\n\r\n14.   The second, the third and the fourth applicant complain that\r\ntheir rights under Article 8 of the Convention have been violated in\r\nthat the access restrictions concerning them have no basis in domestic\r\nlaw and are not necessary.\r\n\r\n15.   The second, the third and the fourth applicant complain under\r\nArticle 6 para. 1 of the Convention.that they had no court remedy\r\nagainst the access restrictions concerning them.\r\n\r\n16.   The second applicant complains under Article 8 of the Convention\r\nthat the restrictions on his other relatives' access to him have no\r\nbasis in domestic law and are not necessary. He claims unrestricted\r\ncontact with his maternal grandparents.\r\n\r\n17.   The second applicant complains that the withdrawals from his\r\nnational supplementary insurance account with a view to covering\r\nrunning expenses incurred on account of his placement in the \"family\r\nhome\" violate his property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to\r\nthe Convention. He submits that the withdrawals constituted a de facto\r\ndeprivation of his possessions to which the first applicant has been\r\nforced to consent under threat of having his access rights further\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\n18.   The first and the second applicant complain under Article 6\r\npara. 1 of the Convention that they had no court remedy at their\r\ndisposal against the above-mentioned withdrawals.\r\n\r\n19.   The second applicant complains that he was denied his right to\r\nattend preschool. He invokes Article 2 of Protocol No. 1.\r\n\r\n20.   The first applicant complains under Article 25 of the Convention\r\nabout the refusal to accept his counsel before the Commission as his\r\nofficial counsel in the proceedings under the 1990 Act which he\r\ninitiated in October 1992. He considers that the refusal limits his\r\npossibilities effectively to pursue his complaint with the Commission\r\nin respect of the second applicant's placement in public care.\r\n\r\n21.   The first and the fourth applicant complain that they have been\r\ndiscriminated against, the first one on account of being a single\r\nparent and the fourth one on account of her Finnish origin.\r\n\r\n22.   In the submission of 22 December 1994 the first applicant\r\ncomplains that except on one occasion he has not been informed by the\r\nSocial Council of its notes concerning the second applicant's \"family\r\nhome\", although this is required by Section 52 of the Social Services\r\nAct. No express Convention provision is invoked.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The first applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention that the criminal proceedings leading to his conviction were\r\nnot conducted before an impartial District Court and Court of Appeal.\r\nThey were, moreover, unfair and contrary to the presumption of\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\n      Article 6 (Art. 6) reads, as far as it is relevant to the present\r\ncase, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  In the determination of his civil rights and\r\n      obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone\r\n      is entitled to a fair ... hearing within a reasonable time\r\n      by an independent and impartial tribunal established by\r\n      law. ...\r\n\r\n      2.   Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be\r\n      presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.\r\n\r\n      3.   Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the\r\n      following minimum rights:\r\n      ...\r\n      b.   to have adequate time and facilities for the\r\n      preparation of his defence;\r\n\r\n      c.   to defend himself in person or through legal\r\n      assistance of his own choosing ...;\r\n\r\n      d.   to examine or have examined witnesses against him and\r\n      to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on\r\n      his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against\r\n      him; ...\"\r\n\r\n      The Commission first recalls that the guarantees in paras. 2 and\r\n3 (Art. 6-2, 6-3)are specific aspects of the right to a fair trial set\r\nforth in para. 1 (Art. 6-1) (cf. e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Unterpertinger\r\njudgment of 24 November 1986, Series A no. 110, p. 14, para. 29).\r\nAccordingly, the Commission will have regard to them when examining the\r\nfacts under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1). The Commission's task is to\r\nascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair (cf.,\r\ne.g., Eur. Court H.R., Stanford judgment of 23 February 1994, Series\r\nA no. 280-A, para. 24). As a general rule, however, it is for the\r\ndomestic courts to assess the evidence before them, in particular since\r\nthey have the benefit of hearing witnesses and assessing their\r\ncredibility (Eur. Court H.R., Klaas judgment of 22 September 1993,\r\nSeries A no. 269-A, pp. 17-18, paras. 29-30). The Commission is\r\nnormally not competent to deal with a complaint alleging that errors\r\nof law and fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where\r\nit considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation\r\nof any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or one of\r\nits Protocols, for instance in that a judgment has no legal\r\njustification and thereby violates a party's right to receive a fair\r\ntrial (cf. No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45). It follows\r\nthat it cannot examine whether or not the first applicant was guilty\r\nor innocent.\r\n\r\n      The Commission also recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of\r\nthe Convention it may only deal with a complaint after all domestic\r\nremedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised\r\nrules under international law. A complaint to the Commission must\r\ntherefore have been made at least in substance in the proceedings\r\nbefore the competent domestic organs (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Cardot\r\njudgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, para. 34).\r\n\r\n      In the present case that the Commission finds that the first\r\napplicant has not shown that complaints 1(a) to (g), (i) to (n) and (p)\r\nwere raised at least in substance before the domestic courts. He has\r\nnot therefore exhausted the remedies available to him under Swedish law\r\nin respect of these complaints. Moreover, the Commission finds no\r\nspecial circumstance which might have absolved this applicant,\r\naccording to the generally recognised rules of international law, from\r\nexhausting the domestic remedies at his disposal. It follows that these\r\ncomplaints must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\r\nunder Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Limiting its examination of the fairness of the proceedings to\r\nthe first applicant's complaints 1 (h) and (o), the Commission observes\r\nthat he availed himself of his right to challenge Ms. Ekberg's report\r\nby making a request to hear another expert. There is thus no indication\r\nthat there was in this respect a lack of \"equality of arms\" between the\r\nfirst applicant and the prosecution. The material submitted to the\r\nCommission does not call the findings of the domestic courts into\r\nquestion. In conclusion, there is no indication that the first\r\napplicant was denied a fair trial in this respect. Accordingly, as\r\nthere is no appearance of a violation of Article 6 para. 1\r\n(Art. 6-1), these complaints must be rejected as being manifestly ill-\r\nfounded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n2.    The first applicant complains that his conviction violated\r\nArticle 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention in that, as a result, the second\r\napplicant was kept in public care. The Commission finds no appearance\r\nof such a violation. It follows that this complaint must be rejected\r\nas being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para.\r\n2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n3.    The first and the second applicant complain that the first\r\napplicant was prohibited from taking the second applicant home on his\r\nrelease from his pre-trial detention, this prohibition violating the\r\nfirst applicant's rights under Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the\r\nConvention as well as both applicants' rights under Article 8 (Art. 8).\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention it may only deal with a complaint within a period of six\r\nmonths from the date on which the final decision was taken. It observes\r\nthat the prohibition complained of was issued on 28 January 1991 and\r\nbecame obsolete at the latest on 20 June 1991, when the County\r\nAdministrative Court ordered the second applicant's placement in public\r\ncare. The present application, however, was lodged on 16 November 1992,\r\nthat is more than six months later. Furthermore, an examination of the\r\ncase does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which\r\nmight have interrupted or suspended the running of that period. It\r\nfollows that this complaint has been introduced out of time and must\r\nbe rejected in accordance with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n4.    The third and the fourth applicant complain under Articles 6 and\r\n13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention about lack of a court remedy against\r\nthe refusal to allow them to care for the second applicant during the\r\ninvestigation of the suspicions against the first applicant. The second\r\napplicant also complains that the refusal violated his rights under\r\nArticle 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention to receive information, while\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant complain that the refusal violated\r\ntheir rights under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention to freedom\r\nof expression.\r\n\r\n      The Commission observes that the refusal at issue dates back to\r\n28 January 1991. Reiterating its conclusion with regard to complaint\r\nno. 3, the Commission considers that these complaints have also been\r\nintroduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\r\n27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3)of the Convention.\r\n\r\n5.    The third and the fourth applicant complain under Article 6\r\n(Art. 6) of the Convention that they have been unable to refute the\r\nsuspicions expressed by a social welfare official that they might\r\nsexually abuse the second applicant.\r\n\r\n      Examining the complaint under Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the\r\nConvention, the Commission finds no appearance of a violation of these\r\napplicants' rights. It follows that this complaint must be rejected as\r\nbeing manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n6.    The second applicant complains under Article 7 (Art. 7) of the\r\nConvention that his placement in public care amounts to a punishment\r\nwithout any legal basis. The Commission finds this complaint\r\nunsubstantiated. It follows that it must be rejected as being\r\nmanifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n7.    All applicants complain under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the\r\nConvention that the second applicant's placement in public care, in\r\nparticular in a \"family home\", has not been and is not justified, given\r\nthe ability of the third and the fourth applicant to care for the\r\nsecond applicant, should his public care be terminated or implemented\r\nin their home. They invoke Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention. In\r\ntheir submission of 15 March 1994 the third and the fourth applicant\r\nalso complain under Article 9 (Art. 9) of the Convention that the\r\ndecisions complained of were made in view of their opinion that the\r\nfirst applicant is innocent.\r\n\r\n      Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention reads, as far as relevant,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n      \"1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and\r\n      family life [and] his home ...\r\n\r\n      2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority\r\n      with the exercise of this right except such as is in\r\n      accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic\r\n      society in the interests of national security, public\r\n      safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the\r\n      prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of\r\n      health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and\r\n      freedoms of others.\"\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that \"family life\" within the meaning of\r\nArticle 8 (Art. 8) may include at least the ties between near relatives\r\nsuch as grandparents and grandchildren (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Marckx\r\njudgment of 13 June 1979, Series A no. 31, p. 21, para. 45). However,\r\nthe existence of \"family life\" will depend on a number of factors and\r\non the particular circumstances of each case (cf., e.g., No. 12763/87,\r\nDec. 14.7.88, D.R. 57 p. 216).\r\n\r\n      The second applicant is the child of the first applicant in his\r\nmarriage to S. The first and the second applicant therefore constitute\r\na \"family\" ipso jure (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Hokkanen judgment of\r\n23 September 1994, Series A no. 299-A, para. 54). Moreover, up to his\r\nplacement in public care the third and the fourth applicant were\r\nsignificantly involved in the everyday upbringing of the second\r\napplicant. In these circumstances the decision to place him in public\r\ncare constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect\r\nfor their family life as ensured by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n      In order to be justified under the terms of Article 8 para. 2\r\n(Art. 8-2) such an interference must satisfy three conditions: it must\r\nbe \"in accordance with the law\", it must pursue one or more of the\r\nlegitimate aims enumerated in Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) and it must\r\nbe \"necessary in a democratic society\" for that or those legitimate\r\naims.\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that the placement order was based on the\r\n1990 Act and was, accordingly, made in accordance with the law. The\r\ninterference furthermore had the legitimate aims of protecting the\r\nsecond applicant's \"health or morals\" as well as his \"rights and\r\nfreedoms\" in general.\r\n\r\n      It remains hereafter to determine whether the interference was\r\n\"necessary in a democratic society\" in the interests of the second\r\napplicant. The notion of necessity implies that the interference\r\ncorresponds to a pressing social need and, in particular, requires that\r\nit be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Regard must also be\r\nhad to the margin of appreciation left to the Contracting States (cf.\r\nEur. Court H.R., Olsson judgment of 24 March 1988, Series A no. 130,\r\npp. 31-32, para. 67). The Commission's review is not limited to\r\nascertaining whether the State has exercised its discretion reasonably,\r\ncarefully and in good faith. It cannot confine itself to considering\r\nthe relevant decisions in isolation but must look at them in the light\r\nof the case as a whole. It must determine whether the reasons adduced\r\nto justify the interference at issue are \"relevant and sufficient\"\r\n(cf. the above-mentioned Olsson judgment, p. 32, para. 68). In the\r\npresent case the Commission notes, in particular, the expert evidence\r\nsubmitted by the second applicant's present therapist, recommending\r\nthat the therapy should continue. However, before the County\r\nAdministrative Court the other applicants gave reason to believe that\r\nthey would discontinue this therapy if the second applicant's public\r\ncare were to be revoked. The Court took this into account when\r\nmaintaining public care. It further considered that implementation of\r\nthe public care in the third and the fourth applicant's home could lead\r\nto a conflict of interests jeopardising the care, given the other\r\napplicants' objections to the therapy provided as well as the third and\r\nthe fourth applicant's belief that the first applicant was innocent.\r\n\r\n      In the light of the above and having regard to the State's margin\r\nof appreciation the Commission finds that the public care of the second\r\napplicant has been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that\r\nthe Swedish courts could reasonably find it necessary to maintain his\r\ncare. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with\r\nthe applicants' rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) can\r\nreasonably be regarded as \"necessary in a democratic society\" within\r\nthe meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of that provision in the interests\r\nof the second applicant.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds no further issue under Article 9 (Art. 9)\r\nof the Convention.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this complaint must be rejected as being\r\nmanifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n8.    The second applicant complains under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the\r\nConvention of the conditions in the first \"family home\". Moreover,\r\ncontrary to Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, he had\r\nno court remedy whereby he could have challenged these conditions.\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention it may only deal with the matter within a period of six\r\nmonths from the date on which the final decision was taken. If the\r\nobject of a complaint is not a decision, but an ongoing situation, the\r\nsix months' period starts at the time when the situation ceases to\r\nexist (see, e.g., No. 11123/84, Dec. 9.12.87, D.R. 54 p. 52).\r\n\r\n      The Commission observes that the second applicant was transferred\r\nfrom the first \"family home\" to his present \"family home\" on 25 July\r\n1991, whereas the present application was lodged on 16 November 1992,\r\ni.e. more than six months later. Furthermore, an examination of the\r\ncase does not disclose the existence of any special circumstances which\r\nmight have interrupted or suspended the running of that period. It\r\nfollows that this complaint has been introduced out of time and must\r\nbe rejected in accordance with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n9.    The second applicant complains under Article 5 (Art. 5) of the\r\nConvention of his placement in public care in his present \"family\r\nhome\", given the restrictions on his right to see the other applicants.\r\n\r\n      The Commission cannot find that the second applicant's placement\r\nin the \"family home\" and the related access restrictions amount to a\r\ndeprivation of his liberty within the meaning of Article 5 (Art. 5) of\r\nthe Convention. It follows that this complaint must be rejected as\r\nbeing manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n10.   The first applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention that his request of October 1992 for a termination of the\r\nsecond applicant's public care was not examined by a court within a\r\nreasonable time because the Social Council adjourned its examination\r\nof this request.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has examined this complaint under the above-cited\r\nArticle 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. It reiterates that the\r\nreasonableness of the length of proceedings must be assessed in the\r\nlight of the circumstances of each case and having regard to the\r\nfollowing criteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the\r\nparties and that of the authorities dealing with the case (e.g., Eur.\r\nCourt H.R., Vernillo judgment of 20 February 1991, Series A no. 198,\r\np. 12, para. 30).\r\n\r\n      The applicant's request was examined by the Social Council in\r\nDecember 1992. The applicant's appeal to the County Administrative\r\nCourt was decided upon in May 1993 following an oral hearing. His\r\nfurther appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal was decided upon\r\nin September 1993, also after an oral hearing. Leave to appeal was\r\nrefused by decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 May 1994.\r\n\r\n      The court proceedings involving three courts and two oral\r\nhearings thus lasted less than one and a half year. In the light of the\r\nabove criteria and having regard to the particular circumstances of the\r\ncase the Commission cannot find that this length exceeded a \"reasonable\r\ntime\". Accordingly, there is no appearance of a violation of Article 6\r\npara. 1 (Art. 6-1). It follows that this complaint must be rejected as\r\nbeing manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n11.   The third and the fourth applicant complain under Article 13\r\n(Art. 13) of the Convention about lack of a court remedy against the\r\nSocial Council's refusal to allow them to become the second applicant's\r\nfoster parents pursuant to the Social Services Act.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has considered this complaint under the\r\nabove-cited Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention. Assuming\r\nthat this provision applies, the Commission observes that under Section\r\n73 of the Social Services Act the third and the fourth applicant had\r\na right to challenge the Social Council's refusal before the\r\nadministrative courts. They did not, however, avail themselves of this\r\nopportunity. No further issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this complaint must be rejected as being\r\nmanifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n12.   In the submissions of 15 March 1994 the first applicant complains\r\nunder Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention that he has no\r\ncourt remedy at his disposal against the implementation of the second\r\napplicant's public care.\r\n\r\n      The Commission observes that according to the travaux\r\npréparatoires to the 1990 Act a decision not to transfer a child from\r\na \"family home\" is appealable in administrative court proceedings. It\r\nnotes, in particular, that in its judgment of 15 September 1993  the\r\nAdministrative Court of Appeal examined the first applicant's criticism\r\nof the conditions in the second applicant's \"family home\" in order to\r\nassess whether his public care should be implemented somewhere else.\r\nIn these circumstances the first applicant had access to a court and\r\nthere is no appearance of a violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention. No separate issue arises under Article 13 (Art. 13). It\r\nfollows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded within the\r\nmeaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n13.   The first and the second applicant complain that their rights\r\nunder Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention have been violated in that\r\nthe access restrictions concerning them have no basis in domestic law\r\nand are not necessary.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds no indication that the first applicant has\r\nchallenged the access restrictions at issue by appealing against the\r\nSocial Council's care plan to the administrative courts. The applicants\r\nhave not therefore exhausted the remedies available to them under\r\nSwedish law. Moreover, an examination of this complaint does not\r\ndisclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have\r\nabsolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules\r\nof international law, from exhausting the domestic remedies at their\r\ndisposal. It follows that this complaint must be rejected for\r\nnon-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 27 para. 3\r\n(Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n14.   The second, the third and the fourth applicant complain under\r\nArticle 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention that the access restrictions\r\nconcerning them have no basis in domestic law and are not necessary.\r\n\r\n(a)   In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the second\r\napplicant the Commission, recalling its reasoning with regard to\r\ncomplaint no. 13 above, considers that domestic remedies have not been\r\nexhausted. It follows that this complaint must be rejected under\r\nArticle 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n(b)   In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the third and the\r\nfourth applicant the Commission has found above (in para. 7) that also\r\nthese applicants' relationship with the second applicant constituted -\r\nand constitutes - \"family life\" within the meaning of Article 8\r\n(Art. 8). The Commission considers that the access restrictions now at\r\nissue amounted - and amount - to an interference with the third and the\r\nfourth applicant's \"family life\".\r\n\r\n      In examining whether this interference is justified under para. 2\r\nof Article 8 (Art. 8-2)) the Commission first recalls that the\r\nrequirement that the interference be \"in accordance with the law\"\r\nrelates to the quality of the law in question and implies, inter alia,\r\nthat the law should be accessible to the person concerned, who must\r\nmoreover be able to foresee its consequences for him. In a sphere\r\ncovered by written law, the \"law\" is the enactment in force as the\r\ncompetent courts have interpreted it (cf., e.g., Eur. Court H.R.,\r\nKruslin judgment of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A, pp. 21-22, para.\r\n29). The Commission notes that under Section 11 of the 1990 Act the\r\nSocial Council may decide how the public care is to be implemented. The\r\nCommission is further aware that this provision has been considered by\r\nSwedish courts as constituting the legal basis for access restrictions\r\nconcerning, for instance, grandparents (see No. 21608/93, Dec. 22.2.95,\r\nnot published). It therefore concludes that the restrictions were\r\nsufficiently foreseeable and thus \"in accordance with the law\" within\r\nthe meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2).\r\n\r\n      The Commission accepts that the access restrictions had the same\r\nlegitimate aims as the public care of the second applicant as\r\nimplemented in a \"family home\" (see para. 7 above). As for the question\r\nwhether the interference was \"necessary in a democratic society\" in\r\npursuance of the above aims, the Commission observes that the second\r\napplicant has been allowed to spend one weekend a month in the home of\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant, his paternal grandparents, while\r\nbeing allowed to spend another weekend a month in the home of his\r\nmaternal grandparents. Special arrangements have apparently been made\r\nfor public holidays. Recalling its considerations in para. 7 above as\r\nregards the necessity of the public care as implemented in a \"family\r\nhome\" and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, the\r\nCommission considers that also the access restrictions now complained\r\nof have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that the\r\nSocial Council could reasonably find it necessary to order and maintain\r\nthem. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the interference with\r\nthe third and the fourth applicant's rights under Article 8 para. 1\r\n(Art. 8-1) can reasonably be regarded as \"necessary in a democratic\r\nsociety\" within the meaning of para. 2 (Art. 8-2)of that provision in\r\nthe interests of the second applicant. It follows that this aspect of\r\nthe complaint is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article\r\n27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n15.   The second, the third and the fourth applicant complain under\r\nArticle 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention that they had no court\r\nremedy at their disposal against the access restrictions concerning\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n      In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the second\r\napplicant the Commission, recalling its reasoning with regard to\r\ncomplaint no. 13 above, considers it to be manifestly ill-founded\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the third and the\r\nfourth applicant, the Commission recalls that in order for Article 6\r\npara. 1 (Art. 6-1) to apply to the proceedings in question it must\r\nfirst be ascertained whether there was a dispute over a \"right\" which\r\ncan be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under\r\ndomestic law (cf., e.g., Eur. Court H.R., W v. the United Kingdom\r\njudgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 121-A, p. 32-33, para. 73). Under\r\nSwedish law the third and the fourth applicant have no right of access\r\nto the second applicant. Thus, they cannot, on arguable grounds, claim\r\nto have a \"right\" under domestic law. Article 6 (Art. 6) does not\r\ntherefore apply in their case. It follows that in this respect the\r\ncomplaint is incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the\r\nConvention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2).\r\n\r\n16.   The second applicant complains under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the\r\nConvention that the restrictions on his other relatives' access to him\r\nhave no basis in domestic law and are not necessary. He claims\r\nunrestricted contact with his maternal grandparents.\r\n\r\n      Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above,\r\nthe Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been\r\nexhausted. It follows that this complaint must also be rejected under\r\nArticle 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n17.   The second applicant complains that the withdrawals from his\r\nnational supplementary insurance account with a view to covering\r\nrunning expenses incurred on account of his placement in the \"family\r\nhome\" violate his property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1\r\n(P1-1) to the Convention. He submits that the withdrawals constitute\r\na de facto deprivation of his possessions to which the first applicant\r\nhas been forced to consent under threat of having his access rights\r\nfurther restricted.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that this complaint could be raised in\r\ncivil proceedings instituted by the first applicant for the purpose of\r\nclaiming the restoration of the money withdrawn (cf. No. 14451/88, Dec.\r\n2.7.93, not published). No such action has been brought. The Commission\r\nrecalls that where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a remedy\r\nthat remedy must be tried (e.g., No. 10148/82, Dec. 14.3.85, D.R. 42\r\np. 98).\r\n\r\n      In the above circumstances the Commission finds that it has not\r\nbeen shown that domestic remedies have been exhausted. Moreover, an\r\nexamination of the complaint does not disclose the existence of any\r\nspecial circumstance which might have absolved the applicants,\r\naccording to the generally recognised rules of international law, from\r\nexhausting the domestic remedy at their disposal. It follows that this\r\ncomplaint must be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\r\nunder Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n18.   The first and the second applicant complain under Article 6\r\npara. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention that they have no court remedy at\r\ntheir disposal against the withdrawals from the second applicant's\r\nnational supplementary insurance account.\r\n\r\n      Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 17 above,\r\nthe Commission considers that this complaint is also manifestly\r\nill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n19.   The second applicant complains that he was refused his right to\r\nattend preschool. He invokes Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-2).\r\n\r\n      Leaving aside the question of Sweden's reservation to this\r\nprovision, as valid at the relevant time, the Commission observes that\r\nthe situation complained of ceased to exist in 1991 when the second\r\napplicant started attending elementary school. The application,\r\nhowever, was lodged with the Commission on 16 November 1992.\r\nFurthermore, an examination of the case does not disclose the existence\r\nof any special circumstances which might have interrupted or suspended\r\nthe running of the six month period provided for in Article 26\r\n(Art. 26) of the Convention. It follows that this complaint has been\r\nintroduced out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article\r\n27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n20.   The first applicant complains under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the\r\nConvention about the refusal to accept his counsel before the\r\nCommission as his official counsel in the proceedings under the 1990\r\nAct which he initiated in October 1992. He considers that the refusal\r\nlimits his possibilities effectively to pursue his complaint with the\r\nCommission in respect of the second applicant's placement in public\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n      Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) of the Convention reads, as far\r\nas relevant, as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The Commission may receive petitions ... from any person\r\n      ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the\r\n      High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in this\r\n      Convention, provided that the High Contracting Party\r\n      against which the complaint has been lodged has declared\r\n      that it recognises the competence of the Commission to\r\n      receive such petitions. Those of the High Contracting\r\n      Parties who have made such a declaration undertake not to\r\n      hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.\"\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls that Article 25 para. 1 (Art. 25-1) of the\r\nConvention imposes an obligation on the Contracting States not to\r\ninterfere with the right of the individual effectively to present and\r\npursue his application before the Commission. Such an obligation\r\nconfers upon the applicant a right of a procedural nature\r\ndistinguishable from the substantive rights set out under Section I of\r\nthe Convention or under its Protocols. It flows from the very essence\r\nof this right that it must be open to individuals to complain of\r\nalleged infringements of it in the proceedings before the Commission.\r\nIn this respect the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing\r\nrights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and\r\nillusory (e.g., Eur. Court H.R., Cruz Varas and Others judgment of\r\n20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, pp. 35-36, para. 99).\r\n\r\n      In the case at issue the Commission observes that one of the\r\ncomplaints lodged by the first applicant in the application now under\r\nexamination concerns precisely the question whether the second\r\napplicant's continued placement in public care is justified under\r\nArticle 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention. In these circumstances\r\nthe Commission cannot find that the first applicant has up to this\r\nstage of the proceedings been hindered in the exercise of his right of\r\npetition (cf. ibid., p. 37, para. 104). No action is therefore called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n21.   The applicants complain that the first and the fourth applicant\r\nhave been discriminated against, the first applicant on account of\r\nbeing a single parent and the fourth applicant on account of her\r\nFinnish origin. The Commission finds this complaint unsubstantiated.\r\nIt follows that it is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of\r\nArticle 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n22.   In the submission of 22 December 1994 the first applicant\r\ncomplains that except on one occasion he has not been informed by the\r\nSocial Council of its notes concerning the second applicant's \"family\r\nhome\", although this is required by Section 52 of the Social Services\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n      The Commission, examining this complaint in the light of the\r\nabove-cited Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, cannot find any\r\nevidence that the first applicant has requested access to the notes\r\nconcerned. It has therefore not been shown that domestic remedies have\r\nbeen exhausted. Moreover, an examination of the complaint does not\r\ndisclose the existence of any special circumstance which might have\r\nabsolved the applicants, according to the generally recognised rules\r\nof international law, from exhausting the domestic remedy at their\r\ndisposal. It follows that this complaint must be rejected for\r\nnon-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 27 para. 3\r\n(Art. 27-3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission, unanimously,\r\n\r\n      1.   DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE; and\r\n\r\n      2.   DECIDES TO TAKE NO FURTHER ACTION IN RESPECT OF THE\r\n      ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH THE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OF THE\r\n      RIGHT OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION.\r\n",

BUQUICCHIO, Secretary to the Chamber\r\n\r\n      Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection\r\nof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the application introduced on 10 April 1993 by\r\nElisabeth Girardi against Austria and registered on 7 June 1993 under\r\nfile No. 21985/93;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the report provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules\r\nof Procedure of the Commission;\r\n\r\n      Having regard to the observations submitted by the respondent\r\nGovernment on 31 October 1994, after an extension of the time-limit and\r\nthe observations in reply submitted by the applicant on\r\n8 December 1994;\r\n\r\n      Having deliberated;\r\n\r\n      Decides as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\n\r\n      The facts, as they have been submitted by the parties, may be\r\nsummarised as follows.\r\n\r\n      The applicant, an Austrian citizen, born in 1951, is living in\r\nVienna.  The applicant is the mother of three children born in wedlock\r\nin 1973, 1974 and 1976, respectively.  The spouses separated in 1982.\r\nThe custody over the children born in 1973 and 1974 was assigned to the\r\napplicant, the custody over the child born in 1976 to his father.\r\n\r\n      Since April 1977 proceedings relating to custody and other\r\nmatters concerning the children are pending before the Floridsdorf\r\nDistrict Court (Bezirksgericht).\r\n\r\n      On 31 December 1988 the applicant, on behalf of her children born\r\nin 1973 and 1974, applied with the Floridsdorf District Court that her\r\ndivorced husband be ordered to increase his maintenance payments by\r\nAS 600 per month and per child, as from 1 January 1989, as compared\r\nwith the amount of AS 4550 per child fixed by the Court on\r\n12 August 1986.  Her request was received at the Court on\r\n3 January 1989.\r\n\r\n      On 16 February 1989 the applicant challenged the judicial officer\r\n(Rechtspfleger) at the Floridsdorf District Court dealing with her case\r\nfor bias, which she withdrew on 5 May 1989.\r\n\r\n      On 10 August 1989 the Floridsdorf District Court took a decision\r\non various earlier requests of the applicant regarding the increase of\r\nthe maintenance payments in respect of periods in 1987 and 1988, and\r\nother financial matters.  The amounts of increase for these periods\r\nvaried between AS 200 and AS 1100 per month.  The Court also stated\r\nthat the applicant's request regarding the maintenance payments as from\r\n1 January 1989 would be dealt with following further investigations.\r\n\r\n      On 25 August 1989 the applicant appealed against the decision of\r\n10 August 1989 with the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht).\r\n\r\n      On 1 September 1989 the applicant amended her claims regarding\r\nthe period as from January 1989 to amounts of increase between AS 950\r\nand AS 2000 per month.\r\n\r\n      On 29 November 1989 the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht),\r\nupon the applicant's appeal (Rekurs), amended the District Court's\r\ndecision, granting a higher increase in respect of four months in 1987,\r\nand dismissed the remainder of the appeal.  The decision and the files\r\nwere received at the District Court on 28 December 1989.\r\n\r\n      In the beginning of 1990 the files were forwarded to the Vienna\r\nJuvenile Court (Jugendgerichtshof) in the context of proceedings to\r\nwithdraw the applicant's custody in respect of her child born in 1973.\r\nThe applicant's custody was withdrawn in April 1990, the proceedings\r\nwere disposed of by declaring the child of full age in January 1991,\r\ndecision which became final in October 1992.  Proceedings regarding\r\nfurther financial matters, in particular the applicant's obligation to\r\npay maintenance for the child concerned, continued to be pending before\r\nthe Vienna Juvenile Court.  In May 1993, the Juvenile Court returned\r\nthe files.\r\n\r\n      On 22 October 1993 the Floridsdorf District Court partly granted\r\nthe applicant's request of 31 December 1988 as amended in September\r\n1989, to the extent that it concerned the child born in 1974.  The\r\nCourt granted an increase which varied between AS 200 and AS 1550 per\r\nmonth and dismissed the remainder of her claims.\r\n\r\n      On 7 December 1993 the Vienna Regional Court rejected the\r\napplicant's appeal on behalf of her child, born in 1974, meanwhile an\r\nadult, and dismissed the appeal brought by this child on its own.\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant complains that her request relating to a rise of\r\nmaintenance payments for her children as from 1 January 1989 was not\r\ndealt with within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 10 April 1993 and registered\r\non 7 June 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 29 June 1994 the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the respondent Government for observations on the\r\nadmissibility and merits.\r\n\r\n      On 31 October 1994, after an extension of the time-limit, the\r\nGovernment submitted their observations. The observations in reply by\r\nthe applicant were submitted on 8 December 1994.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains about the length of the proceedings\r\nregarding her request of 31 December 1988 for an increase of\r\nmaintenance payments in respect of two of her children.\r\n\r\n      Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1), so far as relevant, provides that\r\n\"in the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone\r\nis entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time\".\r\n\r\n2.    The proceedings at issue concerned maintenance claims and fall\r\nto be examined under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.\r\nThe Commission notes that the applicant brought the proceedings on\r\nbehalf of her children, who were minor at the relevant time.  The\r\nCommission, taking into account the applicant's position in these\r\nproceedings and the impact of their outcome on her own financial\r\nsituation, finds that the applicant is entitled to complain about the\r\nlength of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n3.    The Government maintain that the applicant failed to exhaust, as\r\nrequired by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, the remedies\r\navailable to her under Austrian law.  They submit that the applicant\r\nfailed to complain about the length in the course of the domestic court\r\nproceedings and did not lodge a request under S. 91 of the Court\r\nOrganisation Act 1990 (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz) that, in view of the\r\nalleged delay, the superior court should fix an appropriate time-limit\r\nfor the conduct of the court proceedings.\r\n\r\n      According to Article 26 (Art. 26), the \"Commission may only deal\r\nwith the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted,\r\naccording to the generally recognised rules of international law\".\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that S. 91 of the Austrian Court\r\nOrganisation Act, which entitles the parties to court proceedings to\r\nlodge a request with the superior court to fix a time limit in respect\r\nof a delayed procedural step, entered into force on 1 January 1990 when\r\nthe proceedings in question were already pending for one year.  At that\r\nstage, the District Court had already been dealing with the applicant's\r\nrequest of December 1988 and, in its decision of 10 August 1989,\r\npostponed the examination thereof, and the Regional Court had decided\r\non the applicant's appeal on 29 November 1989.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that it is thus not faced with the issue of\r\nan alleged absence of any reaction of the competent court to a\r\nprocedural request (cf. No. 19369/92, Dec. 8.1.93, not published).  In\r\nthe circumstances of the present case, a request under S. 91 of the\r\nCourt Organisation Act cannot be considered as an effective remedy to\r\nensure, regarding the proceedings as a whole, a determination of the\r\napplicant's civil rights and obligations within a \"reasonable time\"\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The application cannot, therefore, be rejected for non-compliance\r\nwith the condition as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies under\r\nArticle 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n4.    As regards the merits of the complaint, the Government, referring\r\nto the case-law of the Convention organs, argue that the length of the\r\nproceedings was mainly due to the complexity of the case. In this\r\nrespect, they refer to the numerous other matters related to the\r\nproceedings at issue, and the proceedings before the Vienna Juvenile\r\nCourt.  They consider that no substantial delays were imputable to the\r\nAustrian authorities.   According to the Government, the applicant\r\nherself was responsible for the delays in that she filed numerous\r\nsubmissions and thereby caused difficulties to survey the file and to\r\ndecide upon all of her requests in due time.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers, in the light of the criteria\r\nestablished by the case-law of the Convention institutions on the\r\nquestion of \"reasonable time\" (the complexity of the case, the\r\napplicant's conduct and that of the competent authorities), and having\r\nregard to all the information in its possession, that a thorough\r\nexamination of this complaint is required, both as to the law and as\r\nto the facts.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission unanimously\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE,\r\n      without prejudging the merits of the case.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the First Chamber       President of the First Chamber\r\n\r\n      (M.F. BUQUICCHIO)                       (C.L. ROZAKIS)\r\n\r\n",

The particular circumstances of the case\r\n\r\n      The applicant is a Pakistani citizen born in 1962.  He is\r\ncurrently imprisoned at Her Majesty's Prison Doncaster in South\r\nYorkshire.  He is represented before the Commission by Ms. Kate\r\nAkester, a solicitor working for Justice in London and Mr. Edward\r\nFitzGerald, counsel practising in London.\r\n\r\n      The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n      In December 1978 the applicant, then aged 16, was found guilty\r\nof the murder of his younger brother aged two. He received a mandatory\r\nsentence of detention \"at Her Majesty's pleasure\" pursuant to section\r\n53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as amended).\r\n\r\n      The applicant appealed against both his conviction and sentence.\r\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on 5 March 1980.\r\n\r\n      Under the administrative procedures governing such sentences as\r\nthat received by the applicant, a tariff period is set to fix the\r\nnumber of years' detention required to satisfy the requirements of\r\nretribution and deterrence.  The applicant's tariff period was set at\r\nfifteen years. The Parole Board has twice considered whether or not to\r\nrecommend his release but on both occasions decided against such a\r\ncourse.  These decisions were communicated to the applicant in,\r\nrespectively, February 1987 and February 1991.\r\n\r\nb.    The relevant domestic law and practice\r\n\r\n      Detention at Her Majesty's pleasure\r\n\r\n      Section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (as\r\namended) provides:\r\n\r\n      \"A person convicted of an offence who appears to the Court to\r\n      have been under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence\r\n      was committed shall not, if he is convicted of murder, be\r\n      sentenced to imprisonment for life nor shall sentence of death\r\n      be pronounced on or recorded against any such person but in lieu\r\n      thereof the court shall ... sentence him to be detained during\r\n      Her Majesty's pleasure and, if so sentenced he shall be liable\r\n      to be detained in such a place and under such conditions as the\r\n      Secretary of State may direct.\"\r\n\r\n      Categorisation of detention \"at Her Majesty's pleasure\"\r\n\r\n      In the case of ex parte Prem Singh on 20 April 1993, Evans LJ in\r\nthe Divisional Court held as follows in respect of detention \"at Her\r\nMajesty's pleasure\":\r\n\r\n      \"At the time of sentencing, the detention orders under section\r\n      53 were mandatory.  It is indeed the statutory equivalent for\r\n      young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder.  But the\r\n      sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary\r\n      sentence of which part is punitive (retribution and deterrence)\r\n      and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety\r\n      when the test of dangerousness is satisfied.  The fact that the\r\n      mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards\r\n      release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory\r\n      life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its\r\n      period: see R. v. Secretary of State, ex.p. Doody & others [1993]\r\n      Q.B. 157 and Wynne v. UK (E.C.H.R. 1st December 1992).  The order\r\n      for detention under section 53 is by its terms both discretionary\r\n      and indeterminate: it provides for detention 'during Her\r\n      Majesty's pleasure'. (Section 53(4) which expressly authorised\r\n      the Secretary of State to discharge the detainee on licence 'at\r\n      any time' was repealed by the Parole Board provisions of the\r\n      Criminal Justice Act 1967, but this does not, in my judgment,\r\n      alter the nature of the sentence in any material respect.)  I\r\n      would decide the present case on the narrow ground that,\r\n      notwithstanding Home Office and Parole Board practice, the\r\n      applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary\r\n      life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether Wilson rather\r\n      than Payne governs his case.\"\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      Article 5 para. 4\r\n\r\n      The applicant contends that the procedures governing review of\r\nhis continued detention fail to comply with the requirements of Article\r\n5 para. 4 of the Convention.  In particular he complains that:\r\n\r\n      (i)  he has no right to periodic review of his case to determine\r\n      the justification for continuing detention;\r\n\r\n      (ii) the ultimate decision rests with the executive and not a\r\n      judicial body independent of the executive;\r\n\r\n      (iii) he has no right to an oral hearing or to question the\r\n      witnesses against him in person and call his own witnesses;\r\n\r\n      (iv) he has no acknowledged right to see the reports placed\r\n      before the Parole Board and the Home Secretary.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that  the sentence under which he is held\r\nshould attract the safeguards of Article 5 para. 4 since there is no\r\ndistinction in domestic law between a mandatory life sentence and a\r\ndiscretionary one and, secondly, even if there is, a sentence of\r\ndetention \"at Her Majesty's pleasure\" should be equated with a\r\ndiscretionary sentence.\r\n\r\n      Article 14\r\n\r\n      The applicant also complains of a violation of Article 14 in that\r\nhe is irrationally discriminated against on the basis of his status as\r\na person convicted of murder, because the review procedures governing\r\ncontinued detention of individuals sentenced to discretionary life\r\nsentences are not subject to the same restrictions as those governing\r\nthe applicant's detention.\r\n\r\n PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 31 March 1993 and registered\r\non 27 May 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 6 July 1993, the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the Government and to ask for written observations on\r\nthe admissibility and merits of the complaints under Article 5 para.\r\n4 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were submitted on 6 October 1993\r\nand the applicant's observations in reply were  submitted on\r\n1 December 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 21 January 1994, the Commission decided to grant legal aid to\r\nthe applicant.\r\n\r\n      On 5 April 1994, the Commission decided to invite the parties to\r\nan oral hearing to be held consecutively with the hearing in the case\r\nof Prem Singh v. the United Kingdom, Application No. 23389/94.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing, which took place on 30 June 1994, the parties\r\nwere represented as follows:\r\n\r\nFor the Government\r\n\r\nMr. Iain Christie           Agent\r\nMr. David Pannick Q.C       Counsel\r\nMr. Harry Carter            Adviser\r\nMs Helen Bayne              Adviser\r\nMs Joy Hutcheon             Adviser\r\n\r\nFor the applicant\r\n\r\nMr. Edward FitzGerald       Counsel\r\nMr. Jonathan Cooper         Counsel\r\nMs Kate Akester             Solicitor\r\nMr. Rodney King             Adviser\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n      The applicant, who is serving a sentence of detention at Her\r\nMajesty's pleasure, complains of the absence of any procedure under\r\ndomestic law by which he can have reviewed by a court the lawfulness\r\nof his continued detention. He also complains of discrimination in the\r\nprocedures which are applied to persons convicted of murder. He invokes\r\nArticles 5 para. 4 and 14 (Art. 5-4, 14) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) provides:\r\n\r\n      \"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention\r\n      shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of\r\n      his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his\r\n      release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\"\r\n\r\n      Article 14 (Art. 14) provides:\r\n\r\n      \"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this\r\n      Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground\r\n      such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other\r\n      opinion, national or social origin, association with a national\r\n      minority, property, birth or other status.\"\r\n\r\n      The respondent Government submit that detention at Her Majesty's\r\npleasure is to be equated with the term of mandatory life imprisonment\r\nfor adults and is in effect the equivalent sentence imposed on\r\njuveniles. It is therefore to be regarded as a sentence fixed by law\r\nin respect of the gravity of the offence concerned. They submit that\r\nmandatory and discretionary life sentences differ in fundamental\r\nrespects, both in nature and applicable procedures. Pursuant to the\r\njudgments of the Court, Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) does not grant an\r\nentitlement  to a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence to\r\nperiodic judicial assessment of the grounds for his detention after the\r\nexpiry of his tariff (cf. Eur. Court H.R., Weeks judgment of\r\n2 March 1987, Series A no. 114, and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment\r\nof 25 October 1990, Series A no. 190-A). The requirements of Article\r\n5 para. 4 are accordingly satisfied by the original trial and appeal\r\nproceedings of the applicant.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that detention at Her Majesty's pleasure\r\nis a wholly indeterminate sentence based on the special factor of\r\nyouth. It should be assimilated to discretionary life sentences for\r\nadults in respect of which the European Court of Human Rights has held\r\nthat Article 5 para. 4 of the Convention requires judicial rather than\r\nexecutive control after the expiry of the punitive or \"tariff\" part of\r\ntheir sentence. Since the only justification for his detention is risk\r\nor \"dangerousness\", which is a factor susceptible to change, the\r\napplicant submits that he should have a review of the lawfulness of his\r\ncontinued detention by a body satisfying the guarantees of Article\r\n5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant submits that the procedure for release on licence\r\nof detainees at Her Majesty's Pleasure does not satisfy the\r\nrequirements of Article 5 para. 4 (Art. 5-4) since the Parole Board,\r\nsave immediately after recall, is unable to order release, the ultimate\r\ndecision resting with the executive. An applicant also has no right to\r\nan oral hearing before the Board or to call his own witnesses or to\r\nquestion the witnesses against him.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has taken cognizance of the submissions of the\r\nparties concerning the complaints raised by the applicant. It considers\r\nthat the complaints raise serious issues of fact and law the\r\ndetermination of which should depend on an examination on the merits.\r\nThe application cannot therefore be regarded as being manifestly\r\nill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission unanimously\r\n\r\n      DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the\r\n      merits of the case.\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission            President of the Commission\r\n\r\n      (H.C. KRUGER)                         (C.A. NØRGAARD)\r\n\r\n",

He lives in\r\nSt. Pölten. He is represented before the Commission by Mr. R. K.\r\nFiebinger, a lawyer practising in Vienna.\r\n\r\n      The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties,  may be\r\nsummarised as follows:\r\n\r\n      On 1 January 1987 the applicant was involved in a road traffic\r\naccident in which a cyclist was killed.  A university medical\r\nexamination of a blood sample revealed 0.8 per mille alcohol in the\r\napplicant's blood at the time the sample was taken.\r\n\r\n      In criminal proceedings the applicant was convicted on 15 May\r\n1987 of causing death by carelessness within the meaning of Article 80\r\nof the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch).  The applicant refers to the\r\nevidence by an independent expert, a Dr. Psick,  that given the short\r\nspace of time between the applicant's last drink and the time of the\r\naccident, the applicant could not have absorbed sufficient alcohol to\r\nhave violated the law.  The \"note of the minutes and sentence\"\r\n(Protokolls- und Urteilsvermerk) states that, in calculating the\r\nsentence, the court considered that the applicant had been drinking\r\nalcohol before the offence, but that the condition of Article 81 para.\r\n2 of the Criminal Code (the aggravating circumstance of alcohol\r\nconsumption) was not present.  The \"Facts\" part of the \"note\" referred\r\nto the indictment, and added the words \"but without the element of\r\nalcohol\" (\"wobei die Alkoholisierung entfällt\").\r\n\r\n      On 16 July 1987 the St. Pölten District Authority (Bezirks-\r\nhauptmannschaft) issued a penal order (Straferkenntnis) against the\r\napplicant, which provided for a fine of AS 12,000 with two weeks'\r\nimprisonment in default, plus costs, in respect of the offence of\r\ndriving a car under the influence of alcohol.  The authority relied on\r\na report from its own doctor that, as the level in the applicant's\r\nblood had been 0.8 per mille one and a half hours after the accident,\r\nhe must have had at least O.95 per mille alcohol in his blood at the\r\ntime of the accident.\r\n\r\n      The applicant appealed to the Lower Austrian Provincial\r\nGovernment (Niederösterreichische Landesregierung) which, on 27 July\r\n1988, rejected his appeal.  It referred to a further expert's report\r\nwhich it had had prepared by one of its own doctors, which largely\r\nconfirmed the previous expert report.\r\n\r\n      The applicant made a constitutional complaint to the\r\nConstitutional Court which, on 11 October 1988, rejected the complaint\r\nsummarily.\r\n\r\n      On 29 March 1989 the Administrative Court rejected the\r\napplicant's complaint to it.  It found that the authorities had been\r\nrequired to use their own doctors by Austrian administrative law, and\r\nthere could therefore be no question of a violation of procedural rules\r\nby virtue of the authority having failed to appoint other experts.  As\r\nto the principle of \"ne bis in idem\", the Administrative Court noted\r\nthat Article 14 para. 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and\r\nPolitical Rights was not directly applicable in Austria, and the\r\napplicant could not rely on it. There was accordingly nothing unlawful\r\nin convicting and sentencing the applicant for the administrative\r\noffence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n      The applicant alleges violations of Article 6 of the Convention\r\nin the following respects:\r\n\r\n      (1) He complains that, although an independent court-appointed\r\nexpert had found that the applicant was not unlawfully under the\r\ninfluence of alcohol in the context of the criminal proceedings against\r\nhim, both administrative authorities relied on reports by their own\r\ncivil servants.\r\n\r\n      (2)  The applicant considers that, as he was acquitted in the\r\ncriminal proceedings of having had an unlawful amount of blood alcohol,\r\nthe principle of \"ne bis in idem\" accordingly prohibits a subsequent\r\nconviction under Article 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act.\r\n\r\n      (3)  He considers that the administrative proceedings brought\r\nagainst him were \"criminal\" within the meaning of the Convention, and\r\nthat no \"independent and impartial tribunal\" determined this criminal\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n      At the hearing on 10 May 1993 the applicant for the first time\r\nraised issues under Article 6 para. 2 in that, given that he had been\r\nacquitted before the criminal court of driving with an excess amount\r\nof alcohol in his blood, his susequent conviction in administrative\r\ncriminal proceedings for susbstantially the same offence offended\r\nagainst the presumption of innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 22 May 1989 and registered on\r\n10 January 1990.\r\n\r\n      On 16 October 1991 the Commission decided to request the parties\r\nto submit their written observations on the admissibility and merits\r\nof the application.\r\n\r\n      The respondent Government submitted their observations, after an\r\nextension of the time-limit, on 10 March 1992 and the applicant\r\nsubmitted his observations, also after an extension of the time-limit,\r\non 13 July 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 15 February 1993 the Commission decided to hear the parties\r\nas to the admissibility and merits of this case and Applications Nos.\r\n15523/89, 15527/89, 16713/90, 16718/90 and 16841/90.\r\n\r\n      At the hearings on 10 May 1993, the parties in the present case\r\nwere represented as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Government:\r\n\r\nAmbassador F. Cede          Legal Adviser, Federal Ministry for Foreign\r\n                            Affairs, Agent\r\n\r\nMs. S. Bernegger            Federal Chancellery, Adviser\r\n\r\nFor the applicant:\r\n\r\nMr. R.K. Fiebinger          Representative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant alleges violation of Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1)\r\nof the Convention in various respects.  The Commission has also put\r\nquestions to the parties concerning Article 4 of Protocol No. 7\r\n(P7-4) to the Convention.\r\n\r\n      In connection with Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention, the\r\nGovernment submit that the Austrian reservation to Article 5 (Art. 5)\r\nof the Convention prevents the Commission from examining the complaint.\r\nThey accept, however, that if the reservation does not prevent an\r\nexamination, then the review of administrative decisions by the\r\nAdministrative Court and the Constitutional Court was not sufficiently\r\nwide to comply with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.\r\nThey add, in this respect, that although the offence under Section 5\r\nof the Road Traffic Act was not, as such, in force at the date of the\r\nreservation, the law then in force did impose an obligation on road\r\nusers to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users.\r\n\r\n      To the extent that the absence of an oral hearing is raised, the\r\nrespondent Government also rely on the Austrian reservation to Article\r\n6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.  They also point out that the applicant\r\ndid not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the\r\nAdministrative Court.\r\n\r\n      The applicant considers that the Austrian reservation to Article\r\n5 (Art. 5) of the Convention is in any event not applicable in the\r\npresent case because it cannot cover offences which were not in force\r\nat the date of the reservation.  He considers that the reservation to\r\nArticle 6 (Art. 6), if valid, does not apply to administrative cases.\r\n\r\n      The applicant agrees that the scope of review by the\r\nConstitutional Court and the Administrative Court does not comply with\r\nArticle 6 (Art. 6).\r\n\r\n      In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal\r\nConstitution, the Government consider that, although the provision\r\nprovides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds\r\nwhich were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the\r\nability of the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals\r\nagainst decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural,\r\nnot a substantive limitation.  The Government point out that any appeal\r\nlodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to\r\ncomprehensive review.  The applicant in this respect considers that the\r\nConstitutional Court's jurisdiction has been limited subsequ\r\nentry into force of Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution,\r\nand that therefore, even if the reservation applies, it has not been\r\ncomplied with in this respect.\r\n\r\n      In connection with the issue of the applicant's having been\r\nconvicted by the administrative authorities of the offence of driving\r\na motor vehicle while unfit to drive through drink, even though the\r\nquestion of causing death under the influence of drink had been\r\npreviously determined by the criminal courts, the respondent Government\r\nsubmit first, that the Commission is prevented ratione temporis from\r\nconsidering this complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4).\r\nThey point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed\r\non 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case\r\non 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988,\r\nwhereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988.  The\r\nGovernment submit that because the Administrative Court is required to\r\nreview a decision under administrative criminal law on the basis of the\r\nsubstantive law at the date of commission of the offence (or at the\r\ndate of the first instance decision if more advantageous to a\r\ndefendant), the fact that the Administrative Court took its decision\r\nfive months after the Protocol had entered into force does not affect\r\nthe position.  With regard to the declaration made by Austria when\r\nratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the\r\ndeclaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the\r\nConvention as it is not intended to have legally binding effects on the\r\ninterpretation.  In the alternative they submit that the declaration\r\ndoes comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) and that it prevents the\r\nCommission from considering the question, as it precisely covers the\r\npresent case.  The declaration provides as follows:\r\n\r\n      \"The Republic of Austria declares:\r\n\r\n      1.  Higher Tribunals in the sense of Article 2 (Art. 2),\r\n      paragraph 1, include the Administrative Court and the\r\n      Constitutional Court.\r\n\r\n      2.  Articles 3 and 4 (Art. 3, 4) exclusively relate to\r\n      criminal proceedings in the sense of the Austrian code of\r\n      criminal procedure.\"\r\n\r\n      Finally, they consider that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7\r\n(P7-4) has in any event been complied with as it applies only where the\r\nfacts and legal provisions are to be regarded as a unit.  Thus, they\r\nconclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings\r\nbeing brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that\r\nif by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may\r\nnevertheless be convicted under these.  The Government underline that\r\nthe offence of causing death under the influence of drink contained in\r\nArticle 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code is different in character from\r\nthe provision of Section 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act which makes\r\nit an offence to drive a motor vehicle whilst unfit to drive through\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n      The applicant considers that the Commission is not prevented\r\nratione temporis from applying Protocol No. 7 (P7).  He also considers\r\nthat the declaration made to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3,\r\nP7-4) does not comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention as\r\nit is not clear whether it covers double or multiple convictions only\r\nby the Austrian criminal courts, or double or multiple convictions by\r\nAustrian criminal courts on the one hand and Austrian administrative\r\ncriminal authorities on the other.  The applicant underlines that for\r\nthe individual concerned the principle \"ne bis in idem\" must apply to\r\nevery punishable act, and not merely to the provision of law.  He\r\npoints out that both criminal and administrative authorities apply a\r\nlevel of 0.8 per mille as constituting a state of inebriation.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that these complaints raise complex issues\r\nof law under the Convention, including questions concerning the\r\nAustrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the\r\nConvention, the Austrian declaration to Protocol No. 7 (P7) to the\r\nConvention and questions concerning the competence of the Commission\r\nratione temporis to deal with the complaints under Protocol No. 7 (P7),\r\nthe determination of which must be reserved to an examination of the\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n      This part of the application cannot therefore be declared\r\nmanifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2\r\n(Art. 27-2) of the Convention.  No other ground for declaring it\r\ninadmissible has been established.\r\n\r\n2.    Before the Commission on 10 May 1993, the applicant raised a\r\ncomplaint under Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention.  The\r\nGovernment objected that the complaint had not been brought within the\r\nsix months time limit contained in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention.  The applicant contended that the complaint was covered by\r\nthe wording of his application form, in which he had alleged violation\r\nof Article 6 (Art. 6) \"in particular\" in relation to the matters set\r\nout above.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that the complaint relating to the\r\npresumption of innocence was not made in the applicant's application\r\nform or in correspondence with the Commission's Secretariat.  The mere\r\nfact that, by virtue of general words a complaint is not excluded from\r\nan application, is not sufficient to regard that complaint as having\r\nbeen made.  This part of the application must accordingly be rejected\r\nunder Article 26 in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 26+27-3)\r\nof the Convention as having been introduced out of time.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission\r\n\r\n      unanimously DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the applicant's complaint\r\n      relating to the presumption of innocence and\r\n\r\n      by a majority DECLARES ADMISSIBLE the remainder of the\r\n      application, without prejudging the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Commission                 President of the Commission\r\n\r\n\r\n      (H.C. KRÜGER)                               (C.A. NØRGAARD)\r\n\r\n",

He is currently\r\na member of the Bulgarian National Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 9 March 1992 the authorities seised the applicant's passport\r\nwith reference to Section 7 para. (d) of the Bulgarian Passport Act\r\n(for all references to Bulgarian law see below, Relevant domestic law).\r\nThe applicant filed an appeal on which the authorities have so far not\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 1 July 1992 the Prosecutor General requested the Bulgarian\r\nNational Assembly to institute criminal proceedings against the\r\napplicant on suspicion of having contravened Section 203 of the\r\nBulgarian Penal Code.  He was in particular accused of having\r\nparticipated between 1986 and 1990 as a Deputy Prime Minister in\r\n27 decisions which granted assistance and credits of altogether\r\n34.594.500 USD and 27.072.000 convertible Bulgarian Leva to less\r\ndeveloped countries such as Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos and others.  The\r\nrequest continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"The decisions ... have led to extremely severe results for\r\n      the country's economy in respect of its potential, resources and\r\n      export capacity, and have objectively led to an incapacity to\r\n      repay its foreign debt.  It should be emphasised that due to such\r\n      decisions harmful to the country, and other illegal acts of party\r\n      and government leaders, during this period our foreign debt which\r\n      in 1986 amounted to 4.119.700 USD, increased to 10.656.900.000\r\n      USD in 1989 ...\r\n\r\n           The described situation corresponds to the qualification of\r\n      the crime of the 'benefit of using one's position' in respect of\r\n      particularly big amounts, which qualifies as a specifically\r\n      severe case, falling under Section 203 and Section 219 para. 3\r\n      of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n           The crimes mentioned are 'serious' in the context of Section\r\n      93 para. 7 of the same Code.\"\r\n\r\n      On 7 July 1992 the National Assembly decided to suspend the\r\napplicant's parliamentary immunity and to permit the institution of\r\ncriminal proceedings against him, as well as his arrest and detention\r\non remand.\r\n\r\n      On 9 July 1992 Public Prosecutor D., of the Investigation\r\nDepartment of the General Prosecution, ordered the applicant's\r\nprosecution and his detention on remand.  The order reiterated the\r\ngrounds for the initiation of criminal proceedings as stated in the\r\nProsecutor General's request to the National Assembly of 1 July 1992.\r\nAs to the reasons for imposing detention on remand, it relied on the\r\nextent of public exposure of the committed crime, the personality of\r\nthe performer and the need to secure the applicant's appearance before\r\ncourt, as well as on Sections 50, 177, 180, 196 para. 2 and 207, and\r\nSections 146 to 148 and 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\r\nThe applicant's prosecution was further ordered in connection with\r\nSections 201, 202 para. 1 (1) and 282 para. 3 of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n      Still on 9 July 1992 the applicant was arrested and remanded in\r\ncustody on the premises of the National Investigation Service in Sofia.\r\nThe applicant was represented by various lawyers who, at least until\r\n12 August 1992, had the right to speak with him alone (see below, IV.).\r\n\r\n      On 9 July 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed an appeal with the\r\nBulgarian Supreme Court, requesting the applicant's release from\r\ndetention.  The appeal stated that, contrary to Section 148 para. 1 of\r\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, the warrant of arrest mentioned no\r\ngrounds for the applicant's arrest.  The grounds given could in fact\r\nserve for any arrest.  Furthermore, according to Section 152 of the\r\nCode of Criminal Procedure, it did not suffice if the detention was\r\njustified on the ground that the applicant risked a sentence of more\r\nthan ten years' imprisonment, since para. 2 of Section 152 required as\r\ngrounds for detention a danger of absconding or of committing a further\r\ncrime.  The appeal also invoked Section 31 para. 4 of the Bulgarian\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n      On 13 July 1992 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.  The\r\nCourt decided in the presence of the Public Prosecutor, but in the\r\nabsence of the applicant and his lawyers.  The decision stated:\r\n\r\n           \"Under Section 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal\r\n      Procedure detention is ordered if a sentence of ten or more years\r\n      of imprisonment or the death penalty is envisaged for the crime.\r\n      The offences in Section 203 para. 1 of the Penal Code envisage\r\n      such a penalty.\r\n\r\n           (This provision) contains two cumulative prerequisites -\r\n      misappropriation must have occurred on a large scale and must\r\n      have been particularly serious.\r\n\r\n           The particularly large scale derives from the nominal value\r\n      of the public property involved.  The seriousness of the case\r\n      results from the fact that the misappropriation was done in\r\n      complicity with other persons and from the extremely high degree\r\n      of public danger of the act and the subject (Section 93 para. 8\r\n      of the Penal Code).  The argument that the hypothesis of Section\r\n      152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies in this\r\n      case is groundless.\r\n\r\n           At the time of the accusation the applicant was a member of\r\n      the National Assembly.  He preserves this quality by virtue of\r\n      Section 72 of the Constitution of Bulgaria up to the moment when\r\n      judicial facts occurred by virtue of which the powers of a member\r\n      of the National Assembly may be suspended.  In his capacity as\r\n      member of the National Assembly the applicant represents the\r\n      people as a whole.  It is precisely in this capacity that the\r\n      possibility of Section 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal\r\n      Procedure applying to his case becomes more likely than in the\r\n      case of an applicant who does not have the status of a member of\r\n      the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n           Furthermore, the applicant undertook a judicial appeal\r\n      against the administrative act by which his diplomatic passport\r\n      ... was withdrawn ... These actions of his cast well-founded\r\n      doubts as to whether future actions will not be undertaken by him\r\n      in the context of Section 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal\r\n      Procedure.\r\n\r\n           According to Section 70 of the Constitution of the Republic\r\n      of Bulgaria '... the members of the National Assembly cannot be\r\n      detained and no legal prosecution can be initiated against them\r\n      except for serious crimes and with the permission of the National\r\n      Assembly ...'.  The logical and systematic interpretation of the\r\n      aforesaid provision imposes the conclusion that the measure of\r\n      restriction, 'detention', in the context of the Penal Code is\r\n      determined by the high level of public danger of the act and by\r\n      the special status of the person who has committed it and is the\r\n      subject of the crime, a member of the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n           For this reason the legislator envisaged a qualified\r\n      measure of restriction, detention, in similar cases.  The\r\n      Prosecutor's Office is competent to impose this measure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 4 September 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed a request with\r\nthe Prosecutor General to be released from detention.  Alleging a\r\nchange in circumstances concerning the applicant's state of health and\r\nwith reference to Article 3 of the Convention, the lawyer complained\r\nof the insufficient conditions of the premises where the applicant was\r\ndetained, in particular as other people at the hospital suffered from\r\ncontagious diseases and he was obliged to share cutlery and use common\r\ntoilets.  Reference was made in particular to the reports of the\r\nmedical experts (see below, C. Applicant's state of health) according\r\nto which such conditions constituted a considerable risk for the\r\napplicant's health.  The applicant apparently did not receive a reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 5 September 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed a complaint with\r\nthe Supreme Court against the tacit refusal of the Prosecutor General\r\nto grant the request of 4 September 1992.  Under Article 6 of the\r\nConvention a public hearing on the applicant's appeal was requested.\r\n\r\n      On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal as the\r\nlaw did not provide for judicial control over the acts of the\r\nprosecution during the preliminary investigation of a criminal case.\r\nThe sole exception to this rule was the possibility to appeal against\r\nan order for the imposition of detention.  Besides, the Supreme Court\r\nhad already dealt with the applicant's appeal against his detention,\r\nand under the law the imposition of detention could only be contested\r\nonce.  A new appeal was only possible where a detained person had been\r\nreleased and then again detained.  In all other cases a detained person\r\ncould always request the investigating authorities to replace detention\r\non remand by another measure where there had been a change of\r\ncircumstances.  However, this was within the competence of the\r\ninvestigating authorities, whose decisions could be contested before\r\nthe prosecution, albeit not before the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Based on the conclusions of the medical experts (see below,\r\nC. Applicant's state of health) the applicant's lawyer, on\r\n20 October 1992, requested Public Prosecutor D. to release the\r\napplicant.  It transpires from the subsequent order of Public\r\nProsecutor D. of 2 November 1992 that the Prosecutor General dismissed\r\nthis request on 22 October 1992.\r\n\r\n      On 28 October 1992 Public Prosecutor D. met the applicant and a\r\nlawyer at Sofia hospital.  According to the minutes established, the\r\nlawyer requested D., who was conducting the investigation, to decide\r\non the applicant's request for release.  The applicant himself pointed\r\nout that it was absurd to rely for his detention on the fact that he\r\nhad complained about the withdrawal of his passport.  He also did not\r\nhave another passport.  There was no danger of repeating the offence,\r\nas he was no longer in a position to do so.  As a result, his release\r\nwas imperative.  The applicant also drew attention to the necessity of\r\nconvalescence which was impossible in detention.\r\n\r\n      By order of 2 November 1992 Public Prosecutor D. dismissed the\r\napplicant's request for release as the Prosecutor General had already\r\ndealt with it.  It was stated that the applicant's lawyers had been\r\ninformed of the Prosecutor General's decision of 22 October 1992, and\r\nthat no further appeal was possible.  The order explained that the\r\nProsecutor General was aware of the medical reports and had refused the\r\nrequest as there were no new circumstances permitting the applicant's\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\n\r\n      By letter of 9 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer requested the\r\nGeneral Prosecution to terminate the investigations, explaining that\r\nthe investigations had commenced on 8 July 1992, and that the two\r\nmonths of investigations envisaged by the law had expired on\r\n8 September 1992.  After prolongation, on 8 November 1992 a period of\r\nfour months had expired.  According to Section 222 para. 3 of the Code\r\nof Criminal Procedure, a further prolongation of two months was only\r\npossible in \"exceptional\" cases.  The lawyer contested the exceptional\r\nnature of the applicant's case as in the past four months the General\r\nProsecution had not obtained new means of proof.\r\n\r\n      The lawyer also contested that the accusations disclosed an\r\noffence.  Thus, the decisions of the Council of Ministers had been\r\ntaken collectively within the framework of the constitutional powers\r\nand the budget voted by the National Assembly; the decisions executed\r\nState policies during the period concerned; the authority as such, and\r\nnot the applicant as Deputy Prime Minister, had dealt with the means\r\nconcerned and it had not been established that the applicant had\r\ncommitted the offence in his own or another person's interest.\r\n\r\n      On 10 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer requested the\r\nProsecutor General to release the applicant as the further prolongation\r\nbreached Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention; contrary to Article 5\r\npara. 1 (c) of the Convention no grounds had been given for detention.\r\nThe lawyer refused to comment on the allegation that, as a member of\r\nthe National Assembly, the applicant was particularly dangerous.  On\r\nthe other hand, insofar as it was maintained that the applicant had\r\nappealed against the refusal to apply for a passport, he had only\r\nemployed his rights under Bulgarian law.  The lawyer further invoked\r\nArticles 2 and 5 para. 4 of the Convention; under Article 6 para. 3 (b)\r\nthe lawyer complained that the applicant had not been informed of the\r\ncontent of the accusations against him.\r\n\r\n      On 11 November 1992 the Prosecutor General orally informed the\r\napplicant's lawyers that the applicant's request of 10 November 1992\r\nhad been dismissed as there were no new circumstances justifying\r\nmodification of detention.  According to the Public Prosecutor's\r\nsubsequent letter of 25 November 1992, a copy of this decision was\r\ntransmitted on 16 November 1992 to the applicant's lawyer.\r\n\r\n      On 18 November 1992 the applicant personally wrote a letter to\r\nthe Prosecutor General complaining about the proceedings.  He invoked\r\nSection 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure according to which the\r\nProsecution had to reply to requests in writing.  The applicant\r\nconcluded that the criminal proceedings instituted against him had no\r\nlegal basis and constituted an overt political reprisal.\r\n\r\n      By letter of 20 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer asked Public\r\nProsecutor D. about the outcome of the request of 10 November 1992.\r\nShe explained that the information was important for the application\r\nfiled with the European Commission of Human Rights.\r\n\r\n      On 25 November 1992 Public Prosecutor D. replied that on\r\n16 November 1992 the decision of 11 November 1992 had been transmitted\r\nto the applicant's lawyer, and that minutes concerning these\r\noccurrences had been prepared under Section 100 of the Code of Criminal\r\nProcedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 29 December 1992 the Bulgarian National Assembly reversed its\r\ndecision of 7 July 1992 (see above, I.) authorising the applicant's\r\ndetention on remand.  On 30 December 1992 Prosecutor D. issued an order\r\nfor the applicant's release whereupon the applicant was released.\r\n\r\nC.    Applicant's state of health\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 6 August 1992 the Public Prosecutor ordered the applicant's\r\nexamination by a panel of medical experts.  As from 10 August 1992 the\r\napplicant underwent medical examinations at the Sofia Higher Medical\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\n      The medical experts submitted their conclusions in four reports\r\nbetween 18 and 28 August 1992.  The experts relied inter alia on\r\nprevious reports on the applicant's health of the years 1988-1990.\r\n\r\n      According to these reports, the applicant suffered from malignant\r\nchronic lymphocytic leucaemia, hypertensive disease and chronic\r\nischemic heart disease with stable stenocardia.  The applicant was\r\ndetained in a cell without fresh air or natural lighting.  It was\r\nstated that the applicant required inter alia accommodation in premises\r\nwith sufficient fresh air and natural light, and that stress situations\r\nwere counter-indicated.  The premises of the National Investigation\r\nService were inadequate.  If the applicant was taken to Sofia\r\nPenitentiary Hospital, the latter could offer a general capacity for\r\ntreating a wide range of diseases;  however, it could not be stated\r\nwith certainty whether full prevention of contacts with persons having\r\ndifferent kinds of infections could be prevented.  On the other hand,\r\nsince his chronic diseases were not in an aggravated stage, it was\r\nunnecessary for the applicant to stay in hospital.\r\n\r\n      On 20 August 1992 Public Prosecutor D. issued an order in which\r\nhe confirmed the applicant's detention at the National Investigation\r\nService.  The order, which stated that an appeal could be filed against\r\nit, explained inter alia:\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"The chronic lympholeukosis is in its initial clinical\r\n      phase (zero) and there are no indications of its progress or\r\n      deterioration.  Experts are firm in their conclusion that this\r\n      disease does not call for medical treatment.  The arterial\r\n      hypertension fluctuates and is easily susceptible to control\r\n      through small doses of beta-blockers.  There are no indications\r\n      or signs of coronary insufficiency, disturbances of the heart\r\n      rhythm or cardiac problems.  The results of the medical tests\r\n      show that medicaments have stabilised the (applicant's) health\r\n      condition.  The hygienic requirements and the dietetic regime\r\n      prescribed by the experts should be observed.  Regular check-ups\r\n      by a cardiologist and haematologist are called for, and, if\r\n      necessary, a control by a gastroenterologist.  Hospitalisation\r\n      is unnecessary.  Outpatients' treatment is recommended.\r\n\r\n           As is seen from the above, (the applicant's) health\r\n      condition does not call for modification of the detention ordered\r\n      on 7 July 1992.  The medical facilities at the National\r\n      Investigation Service of the Ministry for the Interior are in a\r\n      position to provide the treatment and medicaments in the\r\n      outpatients' ward.  Arrangements have also been made with the\r\n      Higher Military Medical Institute and the experts for regular\r\n      medical examination.  The living conditions in the arrest\r\n      premises of the National Investigation Service correspond to the\r\n      hygienic requirements.\"\r\n\r\n      On 25 August 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed an appeal claiming\r\nthat the order directly endangered the applicant's health and life.\r\nThus, the National Investigation Service did not provide premises free\r\nfrom stress, complying with the hygienic requirements, offering fresh\r\nair, food rich in vitamins and the possibility of walks in the open.\r\n\r\n      The applicant apparently did not receive a reply to this appeal.\r\n\r\n      On 25 August 1992 the applicant was taken to the Sofia\r\nPenitentiary Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The applicant remained at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital until\r\n7 September 1992 when he was transferred back to the National\r\nInvestigation Service.  Following a deterioration of his cardiovascular\r\ncondition on 10 and 11 September 1992 the applicant was taken to the\r\nintensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.\r\n\r\n      On 11 September 1992 a medical commission informed the Public\r\nProsecutor that, after various complaints, an electrocardiogram had\r\nbeen made of the applicant.  As a result, he should remain under\r\nmedical supervision, his state of health being stable.\r\n\r\n      On 16 September 1992 a medical expert commission issued a report\r\non the applicant's health.  The commission was composed of eight\r\ndoctors, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist.  It found that\r\nthe applicant suffered from high blood pressure, calling for beta-\r\nblockers and small doses of calcium.  Moreover, the applicant had\r\napparently suffered from crises of angina pectoris, particularly at\r\nnight.  On the other hand, there was no sign of a myocardial infarct.\r\nThe Report proposed that the applicant take certain medicaments and be\r\nplaced in a hospital environment.\r\n\r\n      On 17 September 1992 the Head of the Higher Military Medical\r\nInstitute reiterated these conclusions in a letter to the Public\r\nProsecutor.  The applicant remained at the Higher Military Medical\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n      A further medical expert commission of six doctors examined the\r\napplicant at the Higher Military Medical Institute and issued a report\r\non 2 October 1992.  The commission noted malignant chronic lympholeuco-\r\nsis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart, but no signs of\r\ncardiac insufficiency.  Other difficulties concerned inter alia the\r\napplicant's liver, prostate and eyes.  The commission recommended beta-\r\nblockers and other medication and a diet low in fat and calories.  It\r\nsuggested a convalescence period of three weeks under medical\r\nsupervision at a hospital.  A new examination would then be called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The applicant's health being satisfactory, he was transported on\r\n30 November 1992 to the premises of the National Investigation Service.\r\nOn 8 December 1992 his health deteriorated and he was taken to the\r\nSofia Higher Military Medical Institute.\r\n\r\nD.    Order refusing unsupervised contacts with lawyers\r\n\r\n      On 11 August 1992 the applicant published an article in the\r\nBulgarian newspaper \"Douma\" entitled \"Who will pay?\".\r\n\r\n      As a result, by order of 12 August 1992, Public Prosecutor D.\r\nprohibited the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers.\r\nReference was made in particular to Section 75 para. 1 of the Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure.  The order which stated that it could be contested\r\nby means of appeal explained:\r\n\r\n<Translation>\r\n\r\n           \"The daily papers and in particular the 'Douma' newspaper\r\n      after the date of detention of the accused ... published articles\r\n      by him.  Such an article was also published in No. 191/\r\n      August 8 1992 of the said newspaper.  Analysis has shown that\r\n      these publications are of a political nature.  One of the aims\r\n      of these publications is to demonstrate that, irrespective of his\r\n      detention, the <applicant> continues to take an active part in\r\n      the public and political life of the country.  This is\r\n      inadmissible in view of the measure of coercion applied to him.\r\n      Thus, public order is being infringed, mistrust of the judiciary\r\n      is being introduced, and the constitutional principle that rights\r\n      should not be abused has been violated.  According to Section 10\r\n      para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all citizens\r\n      participating in criminal proceedings are equal before the law\r\n      and in this connection no privileges based on public status are\r\n      admitted.  Neither periodicals nor daily newspapers have\r\n      published or will publish materials written by persons in\r\n      custody.  With a view to the nature of this procedural measure\r\n      of coercion, regulatory control has been imposed by the competent\r\n      bodies on the correspondence of those remanded in custody.\r\n      According to the law, it is inadmissible that the <applicant>\r\n      alone should enjoy such a privilege.\r\n\r\n           There are reasons to suspect that irrespective of the oral\r\n      warnings addressed to the <applicant> according to the conditions\r\n      of arrest, he is preparing written material which he transmits\r\n      to his defence lawyers at his meetings with them, when no one\r\n      else is present, under Section 75 of the Code of Criminal\r\n      Procedure, and which are then conveyed to the editorial boards\r\n      of newspapers and other organisations.  This aims at introducing\r\n      public unrest and mistrust of the Bulgarian Judiciary.  Thus, it\r\n      is necessary, provisionally, during the stay of the <applicant>\r\n      at the ... Higher Medical Academy, to restrict his right to meet\r\n      with his defence lawyers without anyone else being present, as\r\n      provided for under Section 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\"\r\n\r\n      On 1 September 1992 Public Prosecutor D. issued a further order\r\naccording to which the applicant, who was now in the Sofia Penitentiary\r\nHospital, was not permitted to \"see other persons, including members\r\nof the family, members of the National Assembly, or his lawyers,\r\nwithout permission in writing given under my signature.  (The\r\napplicant) is not to be given a typewriter; the prison regime has to\r\nbe applied very strictly to him, and no privileges will be granted, as\r\nthis would contravene Section 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Meanwhile, the Human Rights Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion was seised of the applicant's case.  The Committee examined in\r\nparticular the conditions of his detention.  On 12 September 1992, at\r\nthe 88th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Council in Stockholm,\r\nthe Committee issued a Report on the applicant's case in which it\r\nexpressed doubts whether the applicant's detention was justified under\r\nBulgarian law.  The matter is still under consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n      On 9 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer informed Public\r\nProsecutor D. that the applicant had meanwhile filed an application\r\nwith the Commission.  Section VII of the Application Form obliged him\r\nto provide copies of domestic decisions.  The applicant had not\r\nreceived a reply from the authorities in particular to 1) the request\r\nof 4 September 1992, 2) the complaint of 25 August 1992 against the\r\norder of 20 August 1992, 3) the complaint addressed to the Supreme\r\nCourt and 4) the request for release of 22 October 1992.  The Public\r\nProsecutor was requested to submit the necessary documents before\r\n13 November 1992 to enable compliance with the Commission's time-\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n      By letter of 9 November 1992 Public Prosecutor D. replied:\r\n\r\n<Translation>\r\n\r\n           \"The European Commission of Human Rights mentioned in your\r\n      request has not filed any request with the General Prosecution\r\n      enabling it to decide whether it should comply with the request\r\n      in the light of the sovereignty of its own jurisdiction.  An\r\n      application form of the European Commission of Human Rights,\r\n      transmitted via the General Prosecution to (the applicant), is\r\n      personal and does not engage the responsibility of the General\r\n      Prosecution.  The General Prosecution has no knowledge of its\r\n      content as it is a personal document transmitted to him as\r\n      personal correspondence.  The (applicant's lawyers) and (the\r\n      applicant) are aware of the content of the decisions of the\r\n      General Prosecution as to the requests and complaints to which\r\n      you have referred.  For this reason the General Prosecution has\r\n      fulfilled its obligations under the law.  In view of the above\r\n      we shall not comply with your request.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n      Section 5 para. 4 of the Constitution states that any\r\ninternational instrument which has been ratified in the\r\nconstitutionally established procedure, promulgated and has come into\r\nforce with respect to the Republic of Bulgaria, shall be considered\r\npart of domestic legislation of the country.  It shall supersede any\r\ndomestic legislation stipulating otherwise.\r\n\r\n      Section 31 para. 4 of the Bulgarian Constitution states that the\r\nrestrictions of the rights of the accused shall not exceed those\r\nnecessary for the administration of justice.\r\n\r\n      According to Section 70, a member of the National Assembly is\r\nimmune from detention and criminal proceedings except where accused of\r\na serious crime, in which case a decision of the National Assembly\r\nwould be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Section 93 para. 7 of the Penal Code defines as a \"serious case\"\r\na crime sanctioned by at least five years' imprisonment or capital\r\npunishment.  Para. 8 defines as an \"extremely serious case\" a crime the\r\nconsequences of which demonstrate the particularly dangerous character\r\nof the act and its perpetrator for society.\r\n\r\n      Section 201 of the Penal Code states that a civil servant who\r\nmisappropriates public or private funds, objects and other valuables\r\nhanded to him in his capacity as a civil servant or entrusted to him\r\nto safeguard or manage, shall be punished with imprisonment lasting up\r\nto eight years.\r\n\r\n      According to Section 202 the punishment for the misappropriation\r\nof funds by a civil servant shall be between one and ten years if, in\r\norder to facilitate misappropriation, a further crime was committed,\r\nor if the offence was committed together with other persons.\r\n\r\n      Section 203 para. 1 states: \"Whoever misappropriates very large\r\namounts of public funds due to his position in office shall, in serious\r\ncases, be punished with imprisonment lasting between ten and thirty\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n      Section 219 para. 1 states: \"If a civil servant, in his\r\nadministration of assets or of money in his possession or in the\r\nexecution of work which he has been ordered to do, negligently brings\r\nabout considerable material damage, or the destruction or dispersion\r\nof the assets, to the disadvantage of the service concerned or the\r\nnational economy, he will be punished with imprisonment of up to three\r\nyears or forced labour of general interest.\"  According to para. 3, if\r\nthe offence is committed with premeditation and does not constitute\r\nanother, more serious offence, punishment shall be up to eight years'\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n      Section 282 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"(1) A civil servant who does not comply with his professional\r\n      obligations or who commits an abuse of power with the purpose of\r\n      obtaining a material advantage for himself or for a third person\r\n      or of damaging another person, and if not insignificant material\r\n      damage could arise, the punishment will be up to five years'\r\n      imprisonment ...\r\n\r\n      (2) If the act results in considerable material damage or has\r\n      been committed by a person occupying a high administrative post,\r\n      the punishment will be imprisonment lasting eight years ...\r\n\r\n      (3) If the above-mentioned act constitutes a particularly serious\r\n      case the punishment will last between three and ten years ...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Section 10 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure proclaims\r\nthe equality of all persons during criminal investigations.\r\n\r\n      Section 50 defines the accused as the person against whom a\r\ncharge is brought according to the conditions and rules of the Code.\r\n\r\n      Section 75 permits the lawyer of the accused to meet his client\r\nwithout other persons being present.\r\n\r\n      Section 100 provides for the preparation of minutes for every act\r\nof investigation.\r\n\r\n      Section 147 para. 1 states that the measures of judicial control\r\nwill serve the purpose of preventing the accused from absconding, from\r\ncommitting a new offence, or from collusion.  According to para. 2, the\r\nmeasures decided upon must relate to the social danger of the offence,\r\nthe evidence incriminating the accused, his state of health, his family\r\nsituation, his profession, and any other information concerning his\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\n      According to Section 148 para. 1, every decision ordering\r\ndetention on remand must mention the date and place of the decision,\r\nthe authority concerned, the case, the name and date of birth of the\r\ndetained person, the crime of which he is accused, and the grounds of\r\ndetention.  According to para. 2, a copy thereof is transmitted to the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n      Section 152 states, insofar as relevant:\r\n\r\n<Translation>\r\n\r\n      \"(1) Detention on remand shall be imposed if the charges concern\r\n      crimes punishable with imprisonment of ten years or more or with\r\n      capital punishment.\r\n\r\n      (2)  The measure envisaged in the previous paragraph shall not\r\n      be imposed if there is no danger of the accused evading justice\r\n      or committing another crime.\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      (4)  The detained person may immediately file an appeal before\r\n      the court against the imposition of detention.  The Court shall\r\n      decide within a time-limit of three days by means of a decision\r\n      which is final.\"\r\n\r\n      Section 177 states that the Public Prosecutor may conduct the\r\nentire investigations or a part thereof.\r\n\r\n      Section 180 para. 1 states that the investigating authorities\r\nconduct their work by means of decisions.  Para. 2 requires every\r\ndecision to refer to the date and place when it was taken, the\r\nauthority concerned and its signature, the case, the grounds, and an\r\noperative part.\r\n\r\n      Section 196 para. 2 states that if the criminal matter falls\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the investigation shall\r\nbe conducted by a Public Prosecutor of the General Prosecution.\r\n\r\n      Section 207 states that if in the course of the investigations\r\nsufficient evidence has been adduced, and there is no ground to stay\r\nthe prosecution, the investigating judge will decide to commit the\r\napplicant for trial.\r\n\r\n      Section 222 states that the investigations must be brought to an\r\nend within two months after they commenced.  A further prolongation of\r\ntwo months is possible.  In exceptional cases, the investigations may\r\nlast up to six months.  If the period is prolonged after two months,\r\nthe Prosecutor General will decide on the detention on remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n      According to Section 7 (d) of the Bulgarian Passport Act, a\r\npassport may be seised if \"its holder by leaving the territory\r\nconstitutes a threat to the security of the Republic of Bulgaria\".\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains that when he was arrested and detained\r\non remand, there was no reasonable suspicion of him having committed\r\na crime within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (c) of the Convention.\r\nHe further complains that no grounds were given as to the necessity of\r\nhis arrest and detention in order to prevent him from committing an\r\noffence or fleeing after having done so within the meaning of Article\r\n5 para. 1 (c) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n2.    The applicant complains that while remanded in custody he\r\nsuffered inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the\r\nConvention.  He complains in particular that the authorities refused\r\nto take into account the recommendations of various medical experts;\r\nas a result, his health seriously deteriorated.  Moreover, it was\r\nimpossible for him to meet relatives or members of his parliamentary\r\ngroup and of human rights organisations, and contacts with his lawyers\r\nwere restricted.\r\n\r\n3.    The applicant complains that the Supreme Court, when considering\r\nthe applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, decided in camera without the\r\napplicant or other persons being present.  The applicant relies in this\r\nrespect on Article 6 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n4.    Under Article 7 of the Convention the applicant complains that\r\ncriminal proceedings were instituted against him on the basis of acts\r\nwhich did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when they were\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n5.    Under Article 10 of the Convention the applicant complains of the\r\nPublic Prosecutor's order of 12 August 1992 which prohibited him from\r\nwriting articles while in detention on issues irrelevant to the\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n6.    The applicant also invokes Article 18 of the Convention in that\r\nthe purpose of his detention was political and did not correspond to\r\nthe grounds listed under Bulgarian law.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n      The application was introduced on 1 September 1992.  The\r\napplicant made further submissions on 8 September and 18 November 1992.\r\nThe application form was submitted on 7 May 1993, and the application\r\nwas registered on 25 May 1993.\r\n\r\n      On 21 October 1993 the Commission decided to communicate the\r\napplication to the respondent Government and invite them to submit\r\nwritten observations on the admissibility and merits of the\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n      The Government's observations were received by letter dated\r\n5 April 1994 and the applicant's observations in reply were dated\r\n25 May 1994.\r\n\r\n      On 30 August 1994 the Commission decided to invite the parties\r\nto an oral hearing on the admissibility and merits of the application\r\nat which their submissions should cover in particular complaints under\r\nArticles 3, 5 and 18 of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The hearing took place on 12 January 1995.  The Government were\r\nrepresented by their Agent, Mrs. G. Beleva, and by Mrs. J. Miteva.  The\r\napplicant, who was also present, was represented by Mrs. I. Lulcheva,\r\na lawyer practising in Sofia in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW\r\n\r\n1.    The applicant complains under Articles 5 para. 1 (c) and 18\r\n(Art. 5-1-c, 18) of the Convention of his detention on remand.  He\r\nfurther complains that while remanded in custody he suffered inhuman\r\nand degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the\r\nConvention.  Under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention he\r\ncomplains of the decision of the Supreme Court of 13 July 1992.  Under\r\nArticle 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention he submits that there was no legal\r\nbasis for the charges brought against him.  Under Article 10\r\n(Art. 10) of the Convention the applicant complains that he was\r\nprohibited from writing articles while in detention.\r\n\r\n2.    The Government have raised various objections to the\r\nadmissibility of the application.  They contend that the applicant has\r\nsubmitted his complaints to another procedure of international\r\ninvestigation or settlement within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1\r\n(b) (Art. 17-1-b) of the Convention, namely the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion; that part of the application is incompatible ratione temporis\r\nwith the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27\r\npara. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention; and that the applicant has not\r\ncomplied with the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\na)    In respect of the conditions set out in Article 27 para. 1 (b)\r\n(Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention the applicant submits that he did not\r\ninitiate the proceedings before the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and that\r\nthe complaints dealt with by that institution were different from those\r\nraised before the Commission.\r\n\r\n      The Government contend that the Inter-Parliamentary Union has\r\nbeen seised of the same issues as are now before the Commission, and\r\nthat it is irrelevant under Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the\r\nConvention whether or not the decisions of such institutions have any\r\nbinding effect; in any event, the resolutions of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union have great political weight.  The Government refer\r\nhere as an example to the outcome of the proceedings before the Human\r\nRights Committee established under the UN Covenant on Civil and\r\nPolitical Rights.  In the Government's view, it is also irrelevant\r\nwhether or not the institution concerned is inter-governmental.\r\n\r\n      According to Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the\r\nConvention \"the Commission shall not deal with any petition ... which\r\n... has already been submitted to another procedure of international\r\ninvestigation or settlement ...\".\r\n\r\n      In the present case, the Human Rights Committee of the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union examined in particular the conditions of the\r\napplicant's detention.  On 12 September 1992, at the 88th Conference\r\nof the Inter-Parliamentary Council, the Committee issued a Report on\r\nthe applicant's case.  The matter is still under consideration by the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n      The Commission observes that the Inter-Parliamentary Union is an\r\nassociation of parliamentarians from all over the world, set up inter\r\nalia to unite parliamentarians in common action and to advance\r\ninternational peace and cooperation.  The Union is a non-governmental\r\norganisation.  The organs of the Union may adopt resolutions which are\r\ncommunicated by the parliamentarians concerned to the national\r\nparliaments and to international organisations.\r\n\r\n      The Commission has examined the meaning and scope of Article 27\r\npara. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.  It considers that the\r\nterm \"another procedure\" refers to judicial or quasi-judicial\r\nproceedings similar to those set up by the Convention.  Moreover, the\r\nterm \"international investigation or settlement\" refers to institutions\r\nand procedures set up by States, thus excluding non-governmental\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n      The Commission considers that the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\nconstitutes a non-governmental organisation, whereas Article 27 para.\r\n1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) refers to inter-governmental institutions and\r\nprocedures.  It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion do not constitute \"another procedure of international\r\ninvestigation or settlement\" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1\r\n(b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, the present application cannot be declared\r\ninadmissible under Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nb)    In respect of the Commission's competence ratione temporis to\r\nexamine his application, the applicant submits that, while the facts\r\ncomplained of originated before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date when\r\nBulgaria ratified the Convention, the situation complained of continued\r\nafter the Convention had entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that a number of complaints raised by the\r\napplicant are outside the Commission's competence ratione temporis.\r\nReference is made for instance to the seizure of the applicant's\r\npassport; the decision of the Public Prosecutor of 12 August 1992\r\nprohibiting the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers; the\r\nPublic Prosecutor's order of 1 September 1992 prohibiting the applicant\r\nfrom seeing other persons; and the period of the applicant's detention\r\nup to 7 September 1992.\r\n\r\n      The Commission recalls, on the one hand, that with effect from\r\n7 September 1992 Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the\r\nCommission's competence under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention\r\nto receive individual petitions. It follows that any complaints about\r\nfacts occurring prior to 7 September 1992 are incompatible ratione\r\ntemporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of\r\nArticle 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, insofar as the facts complained of relate to\r\nthe period after 7 September 1992, the application cannot be declared\r\ninadmissible as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions\r\nof the Convention.  However, the applicant's various complaints raise\r\ndifferent issues in respect of the Commission's competence ratione\r\ntemporis.  The Commission will therefore duly examine its competence\r\nwhen dealing with the individual complaints.\r\n\r\nc)    In respect of the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the\r\nConvention, the applicant points out that the Supreme Court on\r\n13 July 1992 dealt in the last resort with his appeal against\r\ndetention.  On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the\r\napplicant's further appeal.  The applicant's request of 10 November\r\n1992 for release from detention was dismissed by the Prosecutor General\r\non 11 November 1992, the applicant's lawyer being served with the\r\ndecision on 16 November 1992.  By submitting his claims on\r\n8 September 1992 and an application form on 7 May 1993 the applicant\r\ncomplied in particular with the six months' rule under Article 26\r\n(Art. 26) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The Government maintain that the applicant has not complied with\r\nthe requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.  It is\r\nsubmitted that the applicant filed his application with the Commission\r\non 1 September 1992, i.e. two months before 16 November 1992, the date\r\non which the final decision on the matter had been notified to the\r\napplicant and on which consequently all domestic remedies had been\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n      Under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention \"the Commission may\r\nonly deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been\r\nexhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international\r\nlaw, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final\r\ndecision was taken\".\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that the Supreme Court in the final resort\r\ndismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992.  The applicant then\r\nfiled his submissions with the Commission on 1 and 8 September 1992.\r\nOn 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further\r\nappeal, though the Court stated that it was possible to file a\r\ncomplaint with the Prosecutor General.  The applicant filed an appeal\r\nwith the Prosecutor General which the latter dismissed on 11 November\r\n1992.  Within six months of this date, i.e. on 7 May 1993, the\r\napplicant submitted his application form to the Commission.\r\n\r\n      The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also\r\ncomplied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26\r\n(Art. 26) of the Convention.  It follows that the application can also\r\nnot be declared inadmissible on these grounds.\r\n\r\n3.    The applicant complains that when he was arrested and detained\r\non remand there was no reasonable suspicion of him having committed a\r\ncrime within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the\r\nConvention.  He further complains that no grounds were given as to the\r\nnecessity of his arrest and detention in order to prevent him from\r\ncommitting an offence or fleeing after having done so within the\r\nmeaning of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.  The\r\napplicant also invokes Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention states:\r\n\r\n      \"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.  No\r\n      one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases\r\n      and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\r\n\r\n      ...\r\n\r\n      c.   the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the\r\n      purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on\r\n      reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it\r\n      is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an\r\n      offence or fleeing after having done so; ...\".\r\n\r\n      Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention states:\r\n\r\n      \"The restrictions permitted under this Convention to the said\r\n      rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other\r\n      than those for which they have been prescribed.\"\r\n\r\na)    The Commission recalls that any complaints about facts relating\r\nto a period prior to 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force\r\nof the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, are incompatible ratione\r\ntemporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of\r\nArticle 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      In the present case, it is true that the Supreme Court in the\r\nfinal resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, i.e.\r\nbefore 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the\r\nConvention in respect of Bulgaria.  After the Convention entered into\r\nforce in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant on 10 November 1992 filed\r\na request for release from detention on remand which the Prosecutor\r\nGeneral dismissed on 11 November 1992 on the ground that there were no\r\nnew circumstances justifying modification of detention.\r\n\r\n      The Commission is therefore competent to examine the grounds\r\ngiven by the Supreme Court on 13 July 1992 for the applicant's arrest\r\nand detention, insofar as these grounds remained unchanged and\r\ncontinued to exist after the entry into force of the Convention in\r\nrespect of Bulgaria, until the applicant's release from detention on\r\n30 December 1992.\r\n\r\nb)    The applicant submits that, insofar as the authorities refer, in\r\nrespect of the offence which he had allegedly committed, to Section 203\r\nof the Bulgarian Penal Code, there was no claim, and no evidence, that\r\nhe misappropriated funds personally, and to his own benefit.  Rather,\r\nthe acts of which he was accused concerned collective decisions of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Bulgaria over the period 1986-1989.\r\nThose decisions were taken within the constitutional powers of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers, and in accordance with the policies of the\r\nBulgarian Government and the recommendations of the United Nations and\r\ntheir agencies.\r\n\r\n      The applicant further states that Bulgarian law does not list the\r\ngrounds stated in the order of 9 July 1992 which referred to the nature\r\nof the crime and his personality.  Bulgarian law also does not list the\r\ngrounds stated in the decision of the Supreme Court of 13 July 1992,\r\nnamely that the applicant was detained because he was a member of the\r\nNational Assembly, and had appealed against the withdrawal of his\r\npassport.\r\n\r\n      The applicant also invokes Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention\r\nin that the purpose of his detention was political and did not\r\ncorrespond to the grounds listed under Bulgarian law.  In his view,\r\nconfirmation herefor can be seen in the decision of 12 August 1992\r\nwhich banned meetings between the applicant and his lawyers, thereby\r\nindicating that the true purpose of his detention was to restrict his\r\nright actively and freely to express his political views as a member\r\nof the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that this part of the application is\r\nmanifestly ill-founded.  Thus, the applicant's detention on remand was\r\nlawful in that it was imposed by the competent organs on grounds\r\nprovided for by law.  Reference is made here in particular to Sections\r\n147 and 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure invoked by the\r\ndomestic authorities.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that extending aid to Third World countries\r\nis not an offence under Bulgarian law.  However, this is not the\r\ncorrect formulation of the grounds in respect of which charges were\r\nbrought against the applicant and other persons.  Rather, the charges\r\nwere that, under the cover of development assistance, monies had been\r\ntransferred in different \"deals\" which infringed Bulgaria's economic\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n      The Government also refer in this context to the Convention\r\norgans' case-law, in particular the Bozano case, according to which,\r\nwhere the Convention refers back to domestic law as in Article 5\r\npara. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c), the Convention organs' supervisory powers are\r\nlimited since it is in the first place for the national authorities,\r\nnotably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Eur. Court\r\nH.R., judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 25, para. 58).\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the applicant's detention served no\r\nother purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in\r\nArticle 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention.  The domestic authorities\r\nstrictly apply Bulgarian law equally to all persons, including the\r\napplicant.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that these complaints raise serious\r\nquestions of fact and law which are of such complexity that their\r\ndetermination should depend on an examination of the merits.  This\r\naspect of the case cannot, therefore, be regarded as being manifestly\r\nill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention, and no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n4.    The applicant complains under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the\r\nConvention of inhuman and degrading treatment which he allegedly\r\nsuffered while remanded in custody.  He complains in particular that\r\nthe authorities refused to take into account the recommendations of\r\nvarious medical experts;  as a result, his health seriously\r\ndeteriorated.  For instance, he suffered stenocardiac arrests and had\r\nworse basic indicators of his blood count. Twice he had to undergo\r\ntreatment in the intensive care unit at the Sofia Military Hospital.\r\nHe was sent to the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital despite the danger of\r\ninfections posing a risk to his health and life.\r\n\r\n       The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to\r\nArticle 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.  Thus, it was impossible for him\r\nto meet relatives or members of his parliamentary group and of human\r\nrights organisations, and contacts with his lawyers were restricted.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that this complaint is manifestly ill-\r\nfounded as the authorities constantly reviewed the applicant's health\r\nand adequately reacted to the applicant's complaints and the various\r\nmedical reports.  Reference is made to the fact that after 7 September\r\n1992, the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect\r\nof Bulgaria, the applicant spent altogether only 11 days in prison, and\r\nthe remaining time, altogether 137 days, in various hospitals, among\r\nthem the best in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n      Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention states:\r\n\r\n      \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading\r\n      treatment or punishment.\"\r\n\r\n      According to the Convention organs' case-law, ill-treatment\r\nwithin the meaning of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention must attain\r\na certain minimum level of severity, if it is to fall within the scope\r\nof this provision.  The assessment of this minimum is in the nature of\r\nthings relative and will depend on all the circumstances of the case\r\n(see Eur. Court H.R., Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of\r\n18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, para. 162).\r\n\r\n      With regard to the nature of the present complaints, the\r\nCommission further recalls its case-law according to which inhuman\r\ntreatment may be found to exist when a person's detention as such\r\ncauses him ill-health.  In such cases, however, the Commission will\r\nexamine in particular the medical treatment at that person's disposal.\r\nThere remains furthermore the State's obligation to maintain a\r\ncontinuous review of the detention arrangements employed with a view\r\nto ensuring the health and well-being of all prisoners, having due\r\nregard to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see\r\nNo. 8224/78, Bonnechaux v. Switzerland, Comm. Report 5.12.79, D.R. 18\r\np. 126 et seq. at p. 148; No. 8317/78, McFeeley and others v. the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Dec. 15.5.80, D.R. 20 p. 44 et seq. at p. 81).\r\n\r\n      In the present case the Commission will first examine the\r\napplicant's state of health while in detention.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date\r\non which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria,\r\nmedical reports were issued on the applicant's health between 18 and\r\n28 August 1992.\r\n\r\n      Thereafter, further reports were issued on 16 September 1992 and\r\non 2 October 1992.  These reports were prepared by numerous medical\r\nexperts, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist.  It transpires\r\nfrom these reports that the applicant suffered from malignant chronic\r\nlympholeucosis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart.  While\r\nthe applicant had apparently suffered from angina pectoris, there was\r\nno sign of a myocardial infarct.\r\n\r\n      While the applicant's state of ill-health was serious, the\r\nCommission considers that his ailments were due to disorders which were\r\nmainly of a long-lasting nature.  Indeed, when preparing their reports,\r\nthe experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health\r\nof the years 1988-1990.  It has therefore not sufficiently been made\r\nout that the applicant's ailments arose as the direct consequence of\r\nhis detention (see No. 9044/80, Chartier v. Italy, Comm. Report\r\n8.12.92, D.R. 33, p. 41 et seq., at p. 58).\r\n\r\n      Against this background the Commission will examine whether the\r\ntreatment afforded to the applicant by the authorities was adequate.\r\nIn particular, a problem could arise under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the\r\nConvention if no, or only insufficient, treatment was available to him.\r\n\r\n      On 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention\r\nentered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant was\r\ntransferred from the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital to the National\r\nInvestigation Service.  However, following a deterioration of his\r\ncardiovascular condition on 10 and 11 September 1992, he was taken to\r\nthe intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.\r\n\r\n      In the medical report of 16 September 1992 it was found that the\r\napplicant should take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital\r\nenvironment.  The report of 2 October 1992 recommended certain\r\nmedication and a convalescence period of three weeks under medical\r\nsupervision at a hospital.  As a result, the applicant remained at the\r\nHigher Military Medical Institute until 30 November 1992 when he\r\nreturned to the National Investigation Service.  A week later, when his\r\nhealth deteriorated, he was again taken to the Higher Military Medical\r\nInstitute.  On 30 December 1992 he was released from detention.\r\n\r\n      The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was\r\nmonitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their\r\nrecommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required\r\nmedical treatment.  Indeed, after 7 September 1992 most of his\r\ndetention was spent in hospital.  At one stage he was even brought to\r\nthe intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.\r\n\r\n      Insofar as the applicant submits that he risked infection, inter\r\nalia at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, he has not alleged that he was\r\nbrought into close contact with persons suffering from contagious\r\ndiseases, and indeed, it does not transpire that he was infected with\r\nany particular illness while in hospital.\r\n\r\n      On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the\r\napplicant's state of ill-health.  They continuously reviewed the\r\ndetention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's\r\nhealth as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      As a result the Commission considers that the manner in which the\r\napplicant underwent detention does not constitute treatment attaining\r\nthe minimum level of severity falling within the scope of Article 3\r\n(Art. 3) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      Insofar as the applicant complains that the prohibition to meet\r\nrelatives and other persons amounted to degrading treatment contrary\r\nto Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, the Commission finds no\r\nseparate issue under this provision.\r\n\r\n      It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-\r\nfounded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n5.    The applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the\r\nConvention that the Supreme Court, when considering his appeal on\r\n13 July 1992, decided in camera without the applicant or other persons\r\nbeing present.  However, the fact complained of relates to a period\r\nprior to 7 September 1992 on which date the Convention entered into\r\nforce in respect of Bulgaria.  This part of the application is\r\ntherefore incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the\r\nConvention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2).\r\n\r\n6.    Under Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention the applicant\r\ncomplains that criminal proceedings were instituted against him on the\r\nbasis of acts which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time\r\nwhen they were committed.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes that the proceedings instituted against the\r\napplicant have not yet been terminated.  He has not, therefore, been\r\n\"held guilty of any criminal offence\" as set out in Article 7 para. 1\r\n(Art. 7-1) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a\r\nviolation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.  This part of the\r\napplication is therefore manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of\r\nArticle 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n7.    Under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention the applicant\r\ncomplains that during detention he was prohibited from writing articles\r\non issues irrelevant to the subject of the investigations.  The\r\napplicant refers here in particular to the Public Prosecutor's order\r\nof 12 August 1992 which, as a result of the applicant's article\r\npublished on 11 August 1992, prohibited him from transmitting written\r\nmaterials to his lawyers.  The prohibition was renewed in November\r\n1992.  The applicant submits that the order of 12 August 1992 was fully\r\ncarried into effect until the end of August and in early September\r\n1992.\r\n\r\n      The Government submit that the restrictions of the applicant's\r\nfreedom of expression corresponded to the requirements of detention.\r\nIn fact, there was no prohibition, only a limitation of the applicant's\r\ncontacts with his lawyers.  While in detention the applicant wrote\r\naltogether 26 substantial newspaper articles, seven of which appeared\r\nafter 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into\r\nforce in respect of Bulgaria.  He also wrote a book which was published\r\nafter his release.\r\n\r\n      The Commission notes the applicant's submissions that this\r\nprohibition had its effects in August and in early September 1992.  In\r\nthe Commission's opinion, the applicant has not sufficiently\r\nestablished any interferences with his right to freedom of expression\r\nafter 7 September 1992, which is the date of the entry into force of\r\nthe Convention in respect of Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n      This aspect of the application is therefore incompatible ratione\r\ntemporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of\r\nArticle 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.\r\n\r\n      For these reasons, the Commission, by a majority,\r\n\r\n      DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits, the\r\n      applicant's complaints under Articles 5 para. 1 and 18\r\n      (Art. 5-1, 18) of the Convention regarding his detention on\r\n      remand; and\r\n\r\n      DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application.",

CYPRUS\n\n\n(Application no. 73797/01)\n\n\nJUDGMENT\n\n\nSTRASBOURG\n\n\n27 January 2004\n\nTHIS CASE WAS REFERRED TO THE GRAND CHAMBER,\nWHICH DELIVERED JUDGMENT IN THE CASE ON\n15 December 2005\n\nThis judgment will become final in the circumstances set out in Article 44 § 2 of the Convention. It may be subject to editorial revision.\nIn the case of Kyprianou v. Cyprus,\nThe European Court of Human Rights (Second Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:\n\tMr\tJ.-P. Costa, President,\n\tMr\tA.B. Baka,\n\tMr\tL. Loucaides,\n\tMr\tC. Bîrsan,\n\tMr\tK. Jungwiert,\n\tMr\tV. Butkevych,\n\tMrs\tA. Mularoni, judges,\nand Mrs S. Dollé, Section Registrar,\nHaving deliberated in private on 8 April 2003 and 6 January 2004,\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last‑mentioned date:\nPROCEDURE\n1.  The case originated in an application (no. 73797/01) against the Republic of Cyprus lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Cypriot national, Mr Michalakis Kyprianou (“the applicant”), on 9 August 2001.\n2.  The applicant was represented by Mr C. Clerides, Mr L. Clerides, Mr M. Triantafyllides, Mr E. Efstathiou. Mr A. Angelides, Mrs E. Vrahimi, lawyers practising in Nicosia, and Mr B. Emerson and Mr M. Muller, barristers practising in the United Kingdom. The Cypriot Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr P. Clerides, Deputy Attorney-General of the Republic of Cyprus.\n3.  The applicant alleged that Article 6 §§ 1, 2 and 3 subparagraph a. and Article 10 of the Convention had been violated as a result of his conviction and imprisonment for contempt of court.\n4.  The application was assigned to the Third Section of the Court (Rule 52 § 1 of the Rules of Court). Within that Section, the Chamber that would consider the case (Article 27 § 1 of the Convention) was constituted as provided in Rule 26 § 1.\n5.  On 1 November 2001 the Court changed the composition of its Sections (Rule 25 § 1) The case was assigned to the newly composed Second Section (Rule 52 § 1.\n6.  On 7 May 2002 the Court decided to adjourn the examination of the applicant’s complaints and declare part of the application inadmissible.\n7.  On 8 April 2003 the Court declared the remainder of the application admissible regarding the above-mentionned complaints (see paragraph 3).\n8.  The applicant and the Government each filed observations on the merits (Rule 59 § 1). The Chamber having decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing on the merits was required (Rule 59 § 3 in fine), the parties replied in writing to each other’s observations.\nTHE FACTS\nI.  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n9.  The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Nicosia.\n10.  The applicant is an advocate who has been practising for forty years. He was formerly a lawyer at the Office of the Attorney‑General and a member of the Cypriot House of Representatives.\n11.  The applicant’s complaints originated in his conviction for contempt of court. On 14 February 2001 the applicant was defending someone accused of murder before the Limassol Assize Court. He was conducting the cross-examination of a prosecution witness, a police constable, and alleges that the court interrupted him after he had put a question to the witness. He claims that he had felt offended and had sought permission to withdraw from the case. The Government observed in reply that the court had made a routine intervention with a simple and polite remark regarding the manner in which the applicant was cross-examining of the witness. The applicant had immediately interrupted, without allowing the court to finish its remark and refusing to proceed with his cross-examination.\n12.  The verbatim record of the proceedings reports the following exchange (translation):\n“Court: We consider that your cross-examination goes into detail beyond the extent to which it could go at this stage of the main trial regarding questions...\nApplicant: I will stop my cross-examination....\nCourt: Mr Kyprianou...\nApplicant: Since the Court considers that I am not doing my job properly in defending this man, I ask for your leave to withdraw from this case.\nCourt: Whether an advocate is to be granted leave to withdraw or not, is a matter within the discretionary power of the Court and, in the light of what we have heard, no such leave is granted. We rely on the case of Kafkaros and Others v. the Republic and we do not grant leave.\nApplicant: Since you are preventing me from continuing my cross-examination on significant points of the case, then my role here does not serve any purpose.\nCourt: We consider your persistence...\nApplicant: And I am sorry that when I was cross-examining, the members of the Court were talking to each other, sending “ravasakia” to each other, which is not compatible with allowing me to continue the cross-examination with the required vigour, if it is under the secret scrutiny of the Court.\nCourt: We consider that what has just been said by Mr Kyprianou, and in particular the manner with which he addresses the Court, constitutes a contempt of court and Mr Kyprianou has two choices: either to maintain what he said and to give reasons why no sentence should be imposed on him, or to decide whether he should retract. We give him this opportunity exceptionally. Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law applies to its full extent.\nApplicant: You can try me.\nCourt: Would you like to say anything?\nApplicant: I saw with my own eyes the small pieces of paper going from one judge to an other when I was cross-examining, in a way not very flattering to the defence. How can I find the stamina to defend a man who is accused of murder?\nCourt (Mr Photiou): It so happens that the piece of paper to which Mr Kyprianou refers is still in the hands of brother Judge Mr Economou and Mr Kyprianou may inspect it.\nCourt (Mrs Michaelidou): The exchange of written views between the members of the bench as to the manner in which Mr Kyprianou is conducting the case does not give him any rights, and I consider Mr Kyprianou’s behaviour utterly unacceptable.\nCourt (Mr Fotiou): We shall have a break in order to consider the matter. The defendant (in the main trial) should in the meantime remain in custody.\nCourt: We considered the matter during the adjournment and continue to believe that what Mr Kyprianou said, the content, the manner and the tone of his voice, constitute a contempt of court as provided for in section 44. 1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law 14/60, that is showing to the court by way of words and conduct. We have asked Mr Kyprianou if he has anything to add before we pass sentence on him. If he has something to add, let us hear him, otherwise the Court should proceed.\nApplicant: Mr President, during the break, I wondered what the offence was which I had committed. The events took place in a very tense atmosphere. I am defending a very serious case; I felt that I was interrupted in my cross-examination and said what I said. I have been a lawyer for forty years, my record is unblemished and it is the first time that I face such an accusation. That is all I have to say.\nCourt: We shall adjourn for ten minutes and shall then proceed with sentencing.”\n13.  After a short break the Assize Court, by a majority, sentenced the applicant to five days’ imprisonment. The court referred to the above exchange between the applicant and its members and held as follows:\n“...It is not easy, through words, to convey the atmosphere which Mr Kyprianou had created since, quite apart from the unacceptable content of his statements, the tone of his voice as well as his demeanour and gestures to the Court, not only gave an unacceptable impression of any civilised place, and a courtroom in particular, but were apparently aimed at creating climate of intimidation and fear within the Court. We are not exaggerating at all in saying that Mr Kyprianou was shouting at and gesturing to the Court. \nIt was pointed out to him that his statements and his behaviour amounted to contempt of court and he was given the opportunity to speak. And while there was a reasonable expectation that Mr Kyprianou would calm down and that he would apologise his apologies, Mr Kyprianou, in the same tone and with the same intensity already referred to, shouted, \"You can try me\".\nLater, after a long break, Mr Kyprianou was given a second chance to address the Court, in the hope that he would apologise and mitigate the damage caused by his behaviour. Unfortunately, at this stage Mr Kyprianou still showed no signs of regret or, at least, of apprehension for the unacceptable situation he had created. On the contrary, he stated that during the break he wondered what his crime had been, merely attributing his behaviour to the \"very tense atmosphere\". However, he was solely responsible for the creation of that atmosphere and, therefore, he cannot use it as an excuse. \nMr Kyprianou did not hesitate to suggest that the exchange of views between the members of the bench amounted to exchange of \"ravasakia\", that is, \"love letters\" (See: \"Dictionary of Modern Greek - Spoudi ravasaki (Slavic ravas), love letter, written love note\"). And he accused the Court, which was trying to regulate the course of the proceedings, as it had the right and the duty to do, of restricting him and of doing justice in secret. \nWe cannot conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person, let alone an advocate.\nThe judges as persons, whom Mr Kyprianou has deeply insulted, are the least of our concern. What really concerns us is the authority and integrity of justice. If the Court’s reaction is not immediate and drastic, we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow. An inadequate reaction on the part of the lawful and civilised order, as expressed by the courts, would mean accepting that the authority of the courts be demeaned.\nIt is with great sadness that we conclude that the only adequate response, in the circumstances, is the imposition of a sentence of a preventive nature, which can only be imprisonment.\nWe are well aware of the repercussions of this decision since the person concerned is an advocate of long standing, but it is Mr Kyprianou himself who, through his conduct, brought matters to this end. \nIn the light of the above we impose a sentence of imprisonment of 5 days”.\n14.  The president of the Court also decided to impose a fine of CYP 75 (128.45 euros).\n15.  The applicant served his prison sentence.\n16.  On 15 February 2001 the applicant filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed on 2 April 2001. As ground No. 8 of his appeal, he submitted that a sanction for contempt of court should not be used to suppress aggressive advocacy, so that the advocate had sufficient freedom to conduct his client’s case as he saw fit.\n17.  The Supreme Court stated that the relevant constitutional provisions of Cypriot law on contempt of court reflected the principles of English law. It relied on Article 162 of the Constitution which enables the enactment of legislation giving jurisdiction to any court to order the imprisonment for up to 12 months of any person who does not comply with a judgment or order of that court, and to punish contempt of court. It held that Section 44.2 of the Courts of Justice Law was lawfully authorised by Article 162. Finally, it concluded that it was the applicant who had created a tense atmosphere by his disdainful attitude and by undermining his role.\n18.  The Supreme Court held inter alia:\n“It is not by accident that the successive objectives of the constitutional legislator, which are embodied in Article 30 and Article 162 of the Constitution, exist side by side. The power to sanction contempt of court is aimed at the protection of judicial institutions, which is essential in order to safeguard a fair trial. ...The role of the judge is nothing more than that of the defender of judicial proceedings and of the court’s authority, the very existence of which are necessary to secure a fair trial. A lawyer, a servant of justice, is not a party to the case. By abusing the right to be heard and being in contempt of court, a lawyer intervenes in the proceedings, as any third party, and interferes with the course and thereby harms justice. The judicial sanctioning of contempt, where necessary, is a judicial duty exercised for the purpose of the securing the right to a fair trial”.\n19.  The Supreme Court concluded as follows:\n“We find that Mr Kyprianou, by words and conduct, showed disrespect to the court and committed the offence of contempt in the face of the court contrary to Section 44.2 of the Law”.\n20.  In relation to the sentence imposed on the applicant, the Supreme Court stated inter alia the following:\n“It was up to the Assize Court to deal with the contempt and to decide the means for the treatment and punishment of the person responsible for the contempt. No reason has been shown which justifies our intervention as regards the sentence imposed”.   \nII.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND OTHER RELEVANT MATERIAL\n1.  The Courts of Justice Law 1960\nSection 44.1 (a) reads as follows:\n“Any person who ... on the premises where any judicial proceedings are being held or taken, or within the precincts of the same, shows disrespect, in speech or manner, of or with reference to such proceedings or any person before whom such proceedings are being held or taken ... is guilty of a misdemeanour and is liable to imprisonment for six months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, or to both imprisonment and a fine.”\nSection 44.2 provides as follows:\n“When any offence against paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (I) of sub-section 1 is committed in full view of the court, the court may cause the offender to be detained in custody and, at any time before the rising of the court on the same day, may take cognisance of the offence and sentence the offender to a fine of seventy-five pounds or to imprisonment of up to one month, or to both imprisonment and a fine.”\n2.  The Constitution\nArticle 162 of the Constitution reads as follows:\n“The High Court shall have jurisdiction to punish any contempt of itself, and any other court of the Republic, including a court established by a communal law under Article 160, and shall have power to commit any person disobeying a judgment or order of such court to prison until such person complies with such judgment or order, and in any event for a period not exceeding twelve months.\nA law or a communal law, notwithstanding anything contained in Article 90, as the case may be, may provide for the punishment of contempt of court.”\n3.   Case-law and practice in common-law jurisdictions\n21.  In the United Kingdom, on whose legal system Cyprus based its own laws and practice regarding contempt of court, a Practice Note was issued by the Lord Chief Justice in May 2001 ([2001] 3 All ER 94), according to which a) if an offence of contempt is admitted and the offender’s conduct was directed to the magistrates “it will not be appropriate for the same bench to deal with the matter”, and b) in the case of a contested contempt, “the trial should take place at the earliest opportunity and should be before a bench of magistrates other than those justices before whom the alleged contempt took place. If a trial of the issue can take place on the very day of the alleged offence, such arrangements should be made taking into account the offender’s rights under Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms”.\n22.  In the United States the Supreme Court has established through its case-law that, for contempt based on intemperate remarks made during trial, a public hearing before another judge is required - Mayberry v. Pennsylvania (400 U.S. 455, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L. Ed. 2nd 532 [1971]). In Bloom v. State of Illinois (391 U.S. 194, 88 S. Ct. 1477) the same court found that persons accused of contempt are entitled to a jury trial for instances of serious contempt. The court stated inter alia:\n“Even when the contempt is not a direct insult to the court or the judge, it frequently represents a rejection of judicial authority, or an interference with the judicial process or with the duties of officers of the court ... If the right to jury trial is a fundamental matter in other criminal cases, which we think it is, it must also be extended to criminal contempt cases ... We cannot say that the need to further respect for judges and courts is entitled to more consideration than the interest of the individual not to be subjected to serious criminal punishment without the benefit of all the procedural protections worked out carefully over the years and deemed fundamental to our system of justice. Genuine respect, which alone can lend true dignity to our judicial establishment, will be engendered, not by the fear of unlimited authority, but by the firm administration of the law through those institutionalised procedures which have been worked out over the centuries.”\n4.   Glossary\n23.  The Greek word “ραβασάκια” (“ravasakia”) is the plural of the word “ραβασάκι” (“ravasaki”) which has the following meanings:\n(1)  G. Babinioti, Dictionary of Modern Greek Language, p. 1542 [Γ. Μπαμπινιώτη, Λεξικό Νέας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας]:\n(i)  short and secret letter or note with love content (σύντομη και κρυφή επιστολή ή σημείωμα με ερωτικό περιεχόμενο); \n(ii)  anything written (document, letter, etc.) mainly of un unpleasant nature, which is sent to someone. Synonyms: e.g. letter, note [οτιδήποτε γραπτό (έγγραφο, επιστολή κτλ), κυρ. με δυσάρεστο περιεχόμενο, το οποίο αποστέλλεται σε κάποιον. Συνώνυμα π.χ. γράμμα, σημείωμα].\n(2)  Bousnaki Brothers, The Great Popular Dictionary, 2002, p. 2983 \n[Α/φοι Μπουσνάκη, Το Μεγάλο Λεξικό της Δημοτικής]:\n(i)  note (σημείωμα) ;\n(ii)  love letter (ερωτικό γράμμα).\n(3)  Dictionary of the Common Μodern Greek, p. 1741 (Aristotle University Thessaloniki, Institute of Modern Greek Studies); \n(Λεξικό της Κοινής Νεοελληνικής, Αριστοτέλειο Πανεπιστήμιο Θεσσαλονίκης, Ινστιτούτο Νεοελληνικών Σπουδών): \n(i)  love letter, note (that is sent secretly); [ερωτική επιστολή, σημείωμα (που στέλνεται κρυφά)];\n(ii)  short written message normally of an unpleasant nature (warning, threats, etc.) for the recipient [σύντομο γραπτό μήνυμα, συνήθ. με δυσάρεστο (προειδοποιητικό, απειλητικό) κτλ περιεχόμενο για τον παραλήπτη].\nTHE LAW\nI.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n24.  The applicant contended that he had not been heard by an independent and impartial tribunal. The same court before which the alleged contempt had been committed had found him guilty and had sentenced him. He alleged that the Assize Court had both prosecuted and tried the offence, having been the sole witness in those proceedings, and had pronounced the sentence. Accordingly, the applicant complained of a violation of Article 6 § 1 which, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:\n“In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal...”\nA.  Submissions of the parties\n1.  The Government\n25.  The Government submitted that the applicant’s allegations were based on the assumption that the judges had been involved in the matter as complainants and had therefore had a personal interest in the subsequent proceedings. They stated that such an assumption betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature and function of proceedings for contempt in the face of the court in common-law jurisdictions. They were not proceedings brought by one of the parties or by a complainant. They constituted a sui generis procedure aimed at securing the unimpeded functioning of the courts and safeguarding the authority of the judiciary. The proceedings were not adversarial in the sense that one person was opposed to another; they concerned the integrity of the judicial system. No single judge had any interest in them. The long-established power granted to common-law courts to sanction improper conduct committed in their face was a necessary and indispensable element of a fair trial itself. The Assize Court’s own duty to ensure a fair trial of the persons accused of murder in the present case required it to possess the summary power to deal with any contempt before it. The applicant had not insulted the judges in their individual capacity but had sought to undermine the authority of the judicial system itself.\n26.  The Government further maintained that, in order to be effective, the judicial power to sanction attempts by any person in the courtroom to dominate the court and determine the course of the trial had to be exercised immediately. Otherwise the person in contempt would in effect have achieved his purpose. Moreover, if contempt proceedings had been brought before a different bench, there would have been certain undesirable consequences that could not have been overlooked: the members of the bench would have had to testify about the events which had taken place before their eyes. Their credibility in connection with the facts of which they had become aware while performing their functions would have had to have been tested by other judges and the very integrity of the judiciary would accordingly have been unnecessarily questioned.\n27.  According to the Government, the applicant would have been entitled to allege a breach of the impartiality rule only on the (incorrect) assumption that the Assize Court had been acting in a personal capacity in trying him. There was no basis for a finding of objective bias, if both the context and the fact that there was no complainant were borne in mind. Furthermore, the fact that the applicant had been able to appeal to the Supreme Court, a judicial body with full jurisdiction to review facts and law, cured any possible breach of the impartiality requirement. The requirements of Article 6 had been satisfied, if not by the Assize Court, then by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had independently found that the applicant had been guilty of the offence of contempt, and had upheld the sentence imposed by the Assize Court. The Government stressed that the judges of the Assize Court itself had not been parties to a dispute with the applicant, and the proceedings taken against him had not been taken for the purpose of vindicating any personal rights of the three insulted judges, but in order to protect the courts as a whole within a democratic society governed by the rule of law. The Assize Court’s decision to act without delay had been both necessary and justified in the circumstances.\n28.  The Government submitted that the tribunal had to be presumed impartial until the contrary was proved. There was no evidence that the Assize Court had been biased against the applicant. The sentence of 5 days’ imprisonment had been upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court, and it was thus impossible to argue that the sentence revealed bias on the part of the Assize Court. The power of the court to ensure the proper course of its proceedings and to protect the integrity of the judicial system was necessary to allow the court to secure a fair hearing to those appearing before it. A power to take such measures as were necessary to protect the authority of the court constituted implied limitations on the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention.\n2.  The applicant\n29.  The applicant maintained that the sentence of five days’ imprisonment, imposed on an experienced lawyer of exemplary reputation for what (on the court’s findings) had been a minor transgression, in itself suggested the existence of bias. He submitted that, in proceedings for contempt, a judge should refer the matter to another judge or to the Attorney General, especially if a judge had prematurely expressed a view as to guilt. The conduct of the bench in his case suggested bias, both on a subjective test (as evidenced by their words and the harsh sentence imposed on the applicant) and on an objective test (by virtue of their position as judges in their own cause). The members of the bench in question were both “complainants” and witnesses to the conduct which was alleged to have constituted contempt. The applicant maintained that it was particularly important that the issue should have been determined by an independent tribunal given that (a) there had been a dispute as to the applicant’s intended meaning in using the word “ravasakia” which was a matter of inference; (b) there had been a dispute as to whether he had been justified in complaining about the conduct of the court in the first place; (c) there had been a dispute as to whether his demeanour was intended to be, or was perceived to be, threatening; and (d) the court had been contemplating the imposition of a prison sentence on a lawyer for his conduct in court.\n30.  The applicant contended that the review by the Supreme Court in his case had not cured the alleged partiality. That court had not conducted a rehearing of the case. It had confined itself to points of law. Moreover, it had upheld the manifestly disproportionate sentence imposed on him. The case could have been dealt with by a simple adjournment of proceedings and/or referral of the matter to the Attorney General to decide whether to initiate proceedings or to refer the matter to another bench for trial. The court could also have referred the matter to the Attorney General, who is by law the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, responsible for disciplinary action. Such was the normal practice in Cyprus. As was a referral by a court to the Attorney General when, in the course of a hearing, the judge believed that a criminal offence might have been committed.\nB.  The Court’s assessment\n1.  Applicability of Article 6\n31.  The Court notes that the Government did not dispute the applicant’s submission that Article 6 of the Convention applied or more particularly, that the applicant’s conviction for contempt of court was a conviction for a criminal offence. In any event, the Court finds that the criminal nature of the offence of contempt of court in this case cannot be disputed. Applying the criteria established by the case-law of the Court (see Engel and others v. the Netherlands, judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A no. 22, §§ 82-83; Öztürk v. Germany, judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, §§ 48-50), namely a) the domestic classification of the offence, b) the nature of the offence, and c) the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring, it is clear that the offence in question was criminal. The offence was classified in domestic law as criminal, it was not confined to the applicant’s status as a lawyer, the maximum possible sentence was one month’s imprisonment and the sentence actually imposed on the applicant was 5 days’ imprisonment (see Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, §§ 82-86, ECHR 2003-X). Therefore, the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention in respect of the determination of any criminal charge, and the defence rights of everyone charged with a criminal offence, apply fully in the present case.\n2.  Compliance with Article 6\n32.  The Court reiterates that it is of fundamental importance in a democratic society that the courts inspire confidence in the public and, above all, as far as criminal proceedings are concerned, in the accused. To that end it has constantly stressed that a tribunal must be impartial. Whilst impartiality normally denotes the absence of prejudice or bias, its existence or otherwise can, notably under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, be tested in various ways. It is well established in the Court’s case-law that there are two aspects to the requirement of impartiality. First, the tribunal must be subjectively free of personal prejudice or bias. Personal impartiality is to be presumed unless there is evidence to the contrary. Secondly, the tribunal must also be impartial from an objective viewpoint, that is, it must offer sufficient guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubts (see Sander v. the United Kingdom, no. 34129/96, § 22, ECHR 2000‑V, and Piersack v. Belgium, judgment of 1 October 1982, Series A no. 53, § 30).\n33.  In the present case the applicant alleged that there was evidence of both objective and actual or subjective bias on the part of the Assize Court.\n(a)  Objective test\n34.  The Court considers that the decisive feature of the case is that the judges of the court which convicted the applicant were the same judges before whom the contempt was allegedly committed. This in itself is enough to raise legitimate doubts, which are objectively justified, as to the impartiality of the court - nemo judex in causa sua.\n35.  The Government’s assertion that the judges who convicted the applicant cannot be considered complainants in the proceedings and had no personal interest in the relevant offence but were simply defending the authority and standing of the court is, in the opinion of the Court, theoretical. The reality is that courts are not impersonal institutions but function through the judges who compose them. It is the judges who interpret a certain act or type of conduct as contempt of court. Whether a contempt has been committed must be assessed on the basis of the particular judges’ own personal understanding, feelings, sense of dignity and standards of behaviour. Justice is offended if the judges feel that it has been. Their personal feelings are brought to bear in the process of judging whether there has been a contempt of court. Their own perception and evaluation of the facts and their own judgment are engaged in this process. For that reason, they cannot be considered to be sufficiently detached, in order to satisfy the conditions of impartiality, to determine the issues pertaining to the question of contempt in the face of their own court. The Court endorses in this respect the statement of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Offutt v. USA (348 U.S. 11. 75 S.Ct.11):\n“But judges also are human, and may, in a human way, quite unwittingly identify offence to self with obstruction to law. Accordingly, this Court has deemed it important that district judges guard against this easy confusion by not sitting themselves in judgment upon misconduct of counsel where the contempt charged is entangled with the judge’s personal feeling against the lawyer”.\n36.  In this connection, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court acknowledged that as “persons” they were “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns, and emphasised the importance for them of upholding the authority and integrity of justice.\n37.  The Court considers that in situations where a court is faced with misbehaviour on the part of any person in the courtroom which may constitute the criminal offence of contempt, the correct course dictated by the requirement of impartiality under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is to refer the question to the competent prosecuting authorities for investigation and, if warranted, prosecution, and to have the matter determined by a different bench from the one before which the problem arose. In fact, with the exception of Cyprus, this is the practice in the High Contracting Parties to the Convention as regards behaviour which constitutes the criminal offence of contempt of court. The situation regarding sanctions of a disciplinary nature, in the form of fines, imposed for behaviour which does not attract criminal liability, is different (Ravnsborg v. Sweden, judgment of 23 March 1994, Series A no. 283‑B).\n(b)  Subjective test\n38.  As regards the applicant’s contention concerning the subjective bias of the judges of the Assize Court, the Court notes that the principle that a tribunal shall be presumed to be free of personal prejudice or partiality is long established in the Court’s case-law (see, for example, Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium, judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, p. 25, § 58). The personal impartiality of each judge must be presumed until there is proof to the contrary (ibid.).\n39.  The Court accepts that the facts, as disclosed by the minutes of the relevant proceedings and the final decision of the Assize Court, reveal that a degree of personal partiality did indeed emerge on the part of the judges during their discussion with the applicant. This was triggered, to some extent, by the court’s interpretation of the word “ravasakia” as “love letters” instead of “notes” although that word has two possible different meanings (see § 23 above), the particular context in which it was used and the applicant’s statement that he saw:\n“with [his] own eyes the small pieces of paper going from one judge to an other when [he] was cross-examining ...”.\n40.  In this respect, the Court notes that, in their decision, the judges of the Assize Court stated that the applicant “did not hesitate to suggest that the exchange of views between the members of the bench amounted to an exchange of \"ravasakia\", that is, \"love letters\"” and acknowledged that as “persons” they had been “deeply insulted” by the applicant, even though they went on to say that this was the least of their concerns.\n41.  The lack of impartiality is evidenced by the intemperate reaction of the judges to the conduct of the applicant, as evidenced by their haste to try him summarily for the criminal offence of contempt of court without availing themselves of other alternative, less drastic, measures such as a warning, reporting the applicant to his professional body, refusing to hear the applicant unless he withdrew his statements, or asking him to leave the courtroom. In this respect an additional important factor is the harsh punishment - immediate imprisonment - which they imposed on the applicant while stating, for example:\ni) “We cannot conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person...”\nii) “If the Court’s reaction is not immediate and drastic, we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow (καταστροφικό)”.\n42.  The Court also finds relevant in this connection its observations and conclusions below regarding the complaints of breach of the presumption of innocence and insufficient information as to the nature and cause of the change against the applicant (paragraphs 52-58 and 65-68).\n(c)  The review by the Supreme Court\n43.  The Court notes that the decision of the Assize Court was subsequently reviewed by the Supreme Court. According to the Court’s case-law, it is possible for a higher tribunal, in certain circumstances, to make reparation for an initial violation of the Convention (see the De Cubber v. Belgium judgment of 26 October 1984, Series A no. 86, p. 19, § 33).\n44.  However, in the present case, the Court observes that the Supreme Court agreed with the approach of the first instance court, i.e. that the latter could itself try a case of criminal contempt committed in its face, and rejected the applicant’s complaints which are now before this Court. There was no retrial of the case by the Supreme Court. As a court of appeal, the Supreme Court did not have full competence to deal de novo with the case, but could only review the first instance judgment for possible legal or manifest factual errors. It did not carry out an ab initio, independent determination of the criminal charge against the applicant for contempt of the Assize Court. Furthermore, the Supreme Court found that it could not interfere with the judgment of the Assize Court, accepting that that court had a margin of appreciation in imposing a sentence on the applicant. Indeed, although the Supreme Court had the power to quash the impugned decision on the ground that the composition of the Assize Court had not been such as to guarantee its impartiality, it declined to do so.\n45.  The Court also notes that the appeal did not have a suspensive effect on the judgment of the Assize Court. In this connection, it observes that the applicant’s conviction and sentence became effective under domestic criminal procedure on the same day as the delivery of the judgment by the Assize Court, i.e. on 14 February 2001. The applicant filed his appeal the next day, on 15 February 2001, whilst he was serving the five-day sentence of imprisonment. The decision on appeal was delivered on 2 April 2001, long after the sentence had been served.\n46.  In these circumstances, the Court is not convinced by the Government’s argument that any defect in the proceedings of the Assize Court was cured on appeal by the Supreme Court.\n47.  In conclusion, the Court considers that there has been a breach of the principle of impartiality, on the basis of both the objective and subjective tests. Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\nII. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 2 OF THE CONVENTION\n48.  The applicant complained that he had been presumed guilty as soon as he had objected to the Assize Court’s conduct. He argued that, in essence, he had only been expected to enter a plea in mitigation on his own behalf before the delivery of the court’s final ruling. He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, which provides:\n“Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.”\nA.  The parties’ submissions\n1.  The Government\n49.  The Government referred to their arguments on the question of impartiality. Further, they emphasised that there was no dispute over the underlying facts as to what had happened. Therefore it would have been absurd to adopt the ordinary procedure, where the facts constituting the offence were to be proved through witnesses. Finally, there was no indication that the presumption of innocence had not been upheld. The judges had applied the presumption automatically in their decision-making process, but the facts before them had been such as to rebut that presumption. All judges were imbued with the necessity of upholding the presumption of innocence, and automatically applied it without having to state expressly in every case that they had done so. The fact that the court had stated that what had been said prima facie constituted contempt, and invited representations on the matter, could not be considered a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention. If the applicant had produced a good explanation for what he had said, he would not have been found in contempt. It was totally unrealistic to suggest that the court had closed its mind to this possibility.\n2.  The applicant\n50.  The applicant submitted that his appearance and that of the members of the bench, before a different, independent tribunal, in a hearing to assess whether the applicant’s words and actions amounted to contempt, would have been entirely practicable and fair to both sides. The presumption of innocence required the court to refrain from taking any decision as to the applicant’s guilt until all parties had had an opportunity to make representations. It was clear that the court had made up its mind as to his guilt immediately, and all he had been offered was an opportunity to enter a plea in mitigation as to sentence. That was clear from the Assize Court’s judgment, where it was stated “Later, after a long break, Mr Kyprianou was given a second chance to say something to the Court, in the hope that he would apologise and mitigate the damage caused by his behaviour”.\nB.  The Court’s assessment\n51.  Although there is authority for the proposition that, if a violation of the principle of impartiality is found, it is not necessary to examine other complaints under Article 6 of the Convention (see Findlay v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, § 80), the Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, there are grounds for examining the applicant’s other complaints under that Article (see mutatis mutandis, Göç v. Turkey [GC], no. 36590/97, § 46, ECHR 2002‑V).\n52.  The Court recalls that the presumption of innocence enshrined in Article 6 § 2 of the Convention is one of the constituent elements of a fair criminal trial guaranteed by Article 6 § 1.\n53.  In the present case the Court notes, on the basis of the minutes of the relevant proceedings, that the Assize Court formed and expressed an opinion during its discussion with the applicant amounting to a conclusion that it considered him guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court. In particular, following the court’s refusal to grant him leave to withdraw from the case and his statement regarding the exchange of “ravasakia” between the judges, the court stated the following:\n“We consider that what has just been said by Mr Kyprianou and in particular the manner with which he addresses to the Court constitutes a contempt of court and Mr Kyprianou has two choices: either to maintain what he said and to give reasons why no sentence should be imposed on him or for him to decide whether he should retract. We give him this opportunity exceptionally. Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law applies to its full extent”.\n54.  In this connection, the Court observes that the applicant was given little opportunity to react to the possibility of such a finding or put forward his own explanations and representations in this respect.\n55.  Furthermore, following the applicant’s persistence and a second short break, the court reaffirmed its view by stating that:\n“We continue to believe that what Mr Kyprianou said, the content, the manner and the tone of his voice, constitute a contempt of Court as provided in Section 44.1 (a) of the Courts of Justice Law 14/60”.\n56.  The final decision of the Assize Court imposing the prison sentence was based on the above conclusions formed by the court during its discussions with the applicant. The Court agrees with the applicant that, essentially, he was asked for mitigation rather than given a full opportunity to defend himself against a charge which would have grave consequences for his liberty. In these circumstances, the Court finds that the Assize Court violated the principle of the presumption of innocence.\n57.  The Court reiterates its findings as regards the role of the Supreme Court (see §§ 43-46 above) and the failure to remedy the defects in the proceedings of the Assize Court on appeal.\n58.  It therefore finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention.\nIII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 3 a. OF THE CONVENTION\n59.  The applicant contended that the Assize Court failed to inform him in detail of the accusations against him. In its decision on sentence, the Assize Court held that the applicant’s gestures were intended to create a climate of “intimidation and fear within the court”. The applicant claimed that he could not have known of the court’s fears and that such an accusation should have been specifically put to him. He alleged a violation of Article 6 § 3 a) of the Convention, which provides:\n“Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n(a)  to be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; ...”\nA.  Submissions of the parties\n1.  The Government\n60.  The Government stated that Article 6 § 3 a. did not require that the accused be informed of all the evidence on which a charge was founded. It was sufficient that he was informed of the offences with which he was charged, together with the date and place of their alleged commission.\n61.  The Government further submitted that it was clear from the transcript of the proceedings before the Assize Court that the court had expressly referred both to the facts that constituted the offence and to the relevant statutory provisions. The Supreme Court concluded that the applicant had been sufficiently informed of the matters constituting the contempt.\n62.  The Government stressed that the events that constituted the offence had been brief and simple and had just taken place in the courtroom; there had been no dispute as to what had occurred. The court had expressly told the applicant that what had amounted to contempt had been the content of his specific statement and the tone in which it was made. The transcript of the proceedings could neither capture nor convey the tone in which the applicant had spoken, but he himself had been well aware of it.\n63.  It was highly formalistic to suggest that the allegation that “the tone of his voice as well as his demeanour and gestures to the Assize Court” had been “apparently aimed at creating a climate of intimidation and fear within the Court” constituted a separate allegation against the applicant. The Assize Court specifically mentioned the “tone of his voice when addressing the Court”. The Government submitted that the Court was simply not in a position to assess how a Cypriot court (consisting of native speakers of the Greek language) should have interpreted the Greek word “ravasakia”, which could mean “love letters”, derived from the Slavic word “ravas”. In any case, the applicant would have been well aware of the possible connotations of that word. He must have known that such a comment was inappropriate and capable of misinterpretation.\n2.  The applicant\n64.  The applicant submitted that the information about the charge levelled against him by the members of the bench had been lacking in detail and had not enabled him to prepare his defence. Contrary to the finding of the Supreme Court, neither the allegation of creating a climate of “intimidation and fear”, nor the suggestion that the court had interpreted the word “ravasakia” to mean “love letters”, had been put to him. \nB.  The Court’s assessment\n65.  The Court recalls that the fairness of proceedings must be assessed with regard to the case as a whole (see, for example, Miailhe v. France (No. 2), judgment of 26 September 1996, Reports 1996‑IV, p. 1338, § 43, and Imbrioscia v. Switzerland, judgment of 24 November 1993, Series A no. 275, pp. 13-14, § 38).  Article 6 § 3 a. of the Convention underlines the need for special attention to be paid to informing the defendant of the “accusation”. It affords the defendant the right to be informed not only of the “cause” of the accusation, that is to say the acts he is alleged to have committed and on which the accusation is based, but also the legal characterisation given to those acts. That information should be detailed (see Pélissier and Sassi v. France [GC], no. 25444/94, § 51, ECHR 1999‑II). The scope of this provision must be assessed in the light of the more general right to a fair hearing guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.\n66.  In the present case, the Court observes that the applicant was informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him by the Assize Court after the court had already formed the view that the applicant was guilty of the criminal offence of contempt of court (see §§ 53‑56 above). Furthermore, the material facts which influenced the court’s decision, as expressed in the decision of the majority to impose a prison sentence on him, were not disclosed before that decision. These facts were, first, that the Assize Court interpreted the word “ravasakia” to mean “love letters” rather than “notes”; secondly, the court’s objections regarding the applicant’s tone of voice and his gestures to the court which had created “a climate of intimidation and fear within the Court”; and thirdly, the Assize Court’s view that the applicant had accused the court of restricting him and of “doing justice in secret”.\n67.  The Court reiterates it findings concerning the review by the Supreme Court (§§ 43-46 above) and the failure to remedy the defects in the proceedings of the Assize Court on appeal.\n68.  In the light of the above, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 3 a. of the Convention.\nIV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION\n69.  Finally, the applicant complained of an interference with his right to freedom of expression which was not prescribed by law, and that the imposition of a fine and a prison term were disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. He alleged a violation of Article 10 which provides, insofar as is relevant:\n “1.  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. ...\n 2.  The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society ... for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.”\n70.  The Government submitted that the applicant’s allegations in relation to Article 10 of the Convention were based on the misconception that participants in judicial proceedings had a right to say whatever they wished in a personal capacity. However, they submitted that an advocate appearing before a court was a servant of justice and the alleged limitations on an advocate’s freedom of expression were not imposed by the impugned domestic law but derived from the very nature of his or her mission and function in the courtroom. The Government maintained that, even if an advocate had personal free speech rights in a courtroom, such rights could be limited for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the judiciary, as had been the case. In view of the degree of insult and the seriousness of the applicant’s contemptuous behaviour, the sanction which had been imposed on him had been justified and fell within the margin of appreciation afforded to the Assize Court, the determination of the “weight” of the contempt in a given case being a function entrusted to the domestic courts.\n71.  The applicant submitted that Article 10 of the Convention applied to all forms of expression, including the expression of an advocate in court. The expression in question had been used by the applicant as a professional advocate while attempting to protect the interests of his client. At worst, he had been guilty of an error of judgment. To sentence a respected advocate, with an exemplary professional record, to five days’ imprisonment for what had been no more than a momentary intemperate outburst, was plainly disproportionate. There was a range of potential responses such as adjournment of the hearing to allow tempers to cool, a warning, reporting the applicant to his professional body, or warning him about his future conduct. He submitted that the imposition of such a plainly disproportionate penalty would have a general “chilling effect” on the conduct of advocates in court, to the potential detriment of their clients’ cases. The applicant contended that it was essential to remember that the power of a court to deal with contempt was designed to prevent a real threat to the administration of justice, and was not a tool to protect the personal dignity of judges or a means of exacting personal retribution where an advocate has caused offence.\n72.  The Court considers that the essential issues raised by the applicant were considered above under Article 6 of the Convention. Accordingly, it does not consider it necessary to examine separately whether Article 10 was also violated.\nV.  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n73.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”\nA.  Damage\n1.  Submissions of the parties\n(a)  The applicant\n74.  The applicant claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage amounting to 120,000 euros (EUR). No claim was made in respect of pecuniary damage.\n75.  The applicant submitted that his case had received extensive publicity in Cyprus and abroad, something which had caused him severe stress, mental suffering and aggravation. He maintained that the wide and adverse media coverage over a number of months had affected his own and his family’s life and reputation, as well as his professional and political career. In the latter connection, he referred to the fact that he had withdrawn his candidacy for membership of parliament in the 2001 elections, due to the embarrassment which he felt.\n76.  The applicant argued that he had been humiliated and treated like a common criminal despite the fact that he had been a law-abiding citizen, a member of parliament and an advocate for about 40 years, with an unblemished record. He was not a convicted prisoner or guilty of such undeserving conduct as to justify a refusal of compensation under Article 41 of the Convention; he had simply been defending his client in a murder trial.\n77.  The applicant, who was a diabetic and at the time had already suffered some loss of eyesight, complained of a deterioration in his condition, particularly his eyesight, as a result of the events that took place. He emphasised that his complaint was not that the events caused his condition but that they had contributed to its deterioration. He pointed out that diabetics required special medical attention on a daily basis which he had not received during the five days spent in prison. He claimed that, following his imprisonment, he had had to undergo treatment. The applicant relied on medical reports which revealed that his condition had been stable for a long period (since 1998) but, immediately after his imprisonment, he had suffered serious complications.\n78.  Accordingly, the applicant argued that a direct causal link existed between the compensation he sought and the breach of his Convention rights. He claimed that if he had been given a fair opportunity to defend himself before an independent and impartial tribunal and to exercise his right to freedom of expression, no finding of guilt or unprofessional conduct would have been made and therefore no violation of the Convention would have occurred. In view of the loss he had suffered, he submitted that the only appropriate remedy was financial restitution, in line with the principles of just satisfaction governing Article 41 of the Convention, and in particular that of restitution in integrum.\n(b)  The Government\n79.  The Government disputed the applicant’s submissions and claimed that, in the event that the Court found a violation of the applicant’s Convention rights, the damage alleged by the applicant could not be regarded as having been caused by such violation, particularly in so far as his complaints under Article 6 of the Convention were concerned. The Government submitted that it was evident from the Supreme Court’s judgment that the applicant would have been convicted and received the same sentence even in the absence of any violation of Article 6. Any mental suffering, stress, humiliation, loss of reputation or physical harm that the applicant could be thought to have suffered had been the consequence of the very existence of the proceedings and their outcome, and not of any violation of his Convention rights. Such damage would have only been relevant if the conviction and/or sentence themselves amounted to a violation of the Convention.\n80.  In relation to the applicant’s complaints about mental suffering, the Government maintained that the issues complained of, in particular the allegation that he had been “treated like a common criminal”, were, to a large extent, ordinarily linked to a sentence of imprisonment. The applicant had been found guilty of a violation of the criminal law which both the Assize Court and the Supreme Court had considered to be sufficiently serious to justify a prison sentence. The applicant’s background and distinguished position should not entitle him to receive any more compensation than any other prisoner who had endured prison life, with its consequent deprivation of liberty, body searches, proximity to other criminals and communal sanitary facilities.\n81.  The Government argued that any loss of reputation and adverse publicity allegedly suffered by the applicant had been a consequence of his own unprofessional and offensive conduct rather than his conviction and imprisonment. It was inevitable that the public’s perception of his ability as a lawyer and as a politician would be affected by the publicity surrounding his case. On an objective assessment of the facts, the applicant’s conduct had been inappropriate and of questionable benefit to his client. Even if he had not been convicted, his conduct before the court would have damaged his reputation in the eyes of any right-thinking people.\n82.  The Government contended that the applicant had not provided any medical evidence to support his claim that his conviction and imprisonment had contributed to or caused the deterioration in his eyesight. They claimed that the medical reports he had provided did not establish any causal link. Indeed, they pointed out that the applicant had already been suffering from retinopathy for two years before his imprisonment (since December 1998), and that it was not uncommon for diabetic retinopathy to develop over time to include macular oedema.\n83.  The Government concluded that, in the event that the Court found a violation of the applicant’s rights under the Convention, such a finding would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction.\n2.  The Court’s assessment\n84.  The Court considers that the applicant must have suffered distress on account of the facts of the case. In particular, it considers that the seriousness of the conviction and the prison sentence imposed on the applicant must have had a negative impact on his professional reputation and on his political image, particularly in a small country like Cyprus. However, the Court does not find that the applicant has established a causal link between the deterioration of his health and the breaches of the Convention which it has found. Overall, therefore, it finds the applicant’s claims excessive, although partly justified.\n85.  Taking into account the various relevant factors and making its assessment on an equitable basis, as required by Article 41 of the Convention, the Court awards the applicant EUR 15,000 under this head.\nB.  Costs and expenses\n86.  Finally, the applicant sought reimbursement of the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Supreme Court and the Court, amounting to 20,180 Cypriot pounds (CYP) [34, 561.80 euros (1 Cyprus Pound = 1.71268 euros)]. He detailed his claims as follows (with reference to a debit note and certain invoices and receipts):\n(a)  CYP 2,520 for fees and expenses, covering work carried out by six lawyers in Cyprus in the proceedings before the Supreme Court.\n(b)  CYP 17,660 for fees and expenses, incurred before the Court. These include a total of CYP 5,160 in fees for the work of Mr C. Clerides, CYP 7,500 in fees for the work of his five other Cypriot lawyers (CYP 1,500 per lawyer), to be paid upon the completion of the proceedings before the Court, and CYP 5,000 in consultation fees for his two British lawyers (the receipts submitted amounted to 7,419 pounds sterling).\n87.  The applicant emphasised the unique nature and complexity of the issues involved in the case. In view of the fact that there was no precedent in the Cyprus courts for such a procedure and conviction, and in the light of the significant issues it revealed concerning the administration of justice, the position of Cypriot advocates before courts and their rights as accused in contempt proceedings, the number of lawyers representing him was reasonable and necessary. Each lawyer dealt with a different aspect of the case. Significantly, the Supreme Court had not objected to the appearance of five lawyers on his behalf. Furthermore, in view of the similarity between the Cypriot and British legal systems, the experience of the British lawyers was also necessary before the Court.\n88.  Lastly, the applicant pointed out that, although the Government alleged that the figures which he had put forward were unreasonable, they had not specified what could be considered a reasonable sum. The applicant submitted that the claim under this head had been assessed in the light of, inter alia, the Court’s relevant case-law.\n89.  The Government contended that the applicant had engaged an excessive number of lawyers. Before the Supreme Court the applicant had been represented by no fewer than six lawyers, and before the Court he was represented by a firm which had hired five Cypriot lawyers as well as two English barristers. They stated that no explanation had been provided by the applicant as to why so many lawyers had been required. Thus, the Government considered that any costs and expenses awarded to the applicant had to be reduced to the level of expenses which could have been reasonably and necessarily incurred.\n90.  According to the Court’s established case-law, costs and expenses will not be awarded under Article 41 unless it is established that they were actually and necessarily incurred, and were reasonable as to quantum. Furthermore, legal costs are only recoverable in so far as they relate to the violation found (see Beyeler v. Italy (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 33202/96, § 27, 28 May 2002).\n91.  First, the Court points out that it has already held that the use of more than one lawyer may sometimes be justified by the importance of the issues raised in a case (see Iatridis v. Greece (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 31107/96, § 56, ECHR 2000‑XI). Moreover, as the applicant’s case before the Supreme Court essentially attempted to remedy the violations of the Convention alleged before the Court, these domestic fees may be taken into account in the assessment of the costs claim. However, it considers that, even if the instant case was to some degree complex and raised significant issues, it was not necessary to have the services of so many lawyers.\n92.  Secondly, although the Court does not doubt that the fees claimed were actually incurred, they appear to be excessive. It also notes that it dismissed a considerable part of the applicant’s claims at the admissibility stage.\n93.  Taking the above into account, and deciding on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant a total of EUR 10,000 under this head.\nC.  Default interest\n94.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n1.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention;\n\n2.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 2 of the Convention;\n\n3.  Holds that there has been a violation of Article 6 § 3 a. of the Convention;\n\n4.  Holds that it is not necessary to examine separately the applicant’s complaint under Article 10 of the Convention;\n\n5.  Holds\n(a)  that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final according to Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into Cypriot pounds at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:\n(i)  EUR 15,000 (fifteen thousand euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n(ii)  EUR 10,000 (ten thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n(iii)  any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n(b)  that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n\n6.  Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 27 January 2004, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\tS.

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 14310/88)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n28 October 1994 \r\n \r\nIn the case of Murray v. the United Kingdom ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in pursuance of Rule 51 of Rules of Court A , as a Grand Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tR. BERNHARDT,\r\n\tMr \tF. GÖLCÜKLÜ,\r\n\tMr \tR. MACDONALD,\r\n\tMr \tA. SPIELMANN,\r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS,\r\n\tMr \tI. FOIGHEL,\r\n\tMr \tR. PEKKANEN,\r\n\tMr \tA.N. LOIZOU,\r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND,\r\n\tMr \tA.B. BAKA,\r\n\tMr \tM.A. LOPES ROCHA,\r\n\tMr \tL. WILDHABER,\r\n\tMr \tG. MIFSUD BONNICI,\r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK,\r\n\tMr \tP. JAMBREK,\r\n\tMr \tK. JUNGWIERT,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Acting Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 23 April and 21 September 1994,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.  The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 7 April 1993, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention. It originated in an application (no. 14310/88) against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 28 September 1988 by Mrs Margaret Murray, Mr Thomas Murray, Mr Mark Murray, Ms Alana Murray, Ms Michaela Murray and Ms Rossina Murray, who are all Irish citizens.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 5 paras. 1, 2 and 5, Article 8 and Article 13 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5, art. 8, art. 13) of the Convention.\r\n2.  In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicants stated that they wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyers who would represent them (Rule 30). The Government of Ireland, having been reminded by the Registrar of their right to intervene (Article 48 (b) of the Convention and Rule 33 para. 3 (b)) (art. 48-b), did not indicate any intention of so doing.\r\n3.  The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 23 April 1993, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr R. Bernhardt, Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr N. Valticos, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr M.A. Lopes Rocha, Mr L. Wildhaber and Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).\r\n4.  As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the United Kingdom Government (\"the Government\"), the applicants’ lawyers and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the orders made in consequence, the Government’s memorial was lodged at the registry on 3 November 1993, the applicants’ memorial on 15 November and their claims for just satisfaction under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention on 23 December 1993, 18 and 20 January 1994. In a letter received on 14 December 1993 the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to comment in writing on the memorials filed.\r\n5.  In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 24 January 1994. The Chamber had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n- for the Government\r\n\t\tMr H. LLEWELLYN, Assistant Legal Adviser,\r\n\t\t\tForeign and Commonwealth Office, \tAgent,\r\n\t\tMr R. WEATHERUP, QC,\r\n\t\tMr J. EADIE, Barrister-at-law, \tCounsel;\r\n- for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr M.P. PELLONPÄÄ, \tDelegate;\r\n- for the applicants\r\n\t\tMr R. WEIR, QC,\r\n\t\tMr S. TREACY, Barrister-at-law, \tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr P. MADDEN, Solicitor.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Pellonpää, Mr Weir and Mr Weatherup.\r\n6.  Following deliberations held on 28 January 1994 the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of a Grand Chamber (Rule 51 para. 1).\r\n7.  The Grand Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr Ryssdal, President of the Court, Mr Bernhardt, Vice-President of the Court, and the other members of the Chamber which had relinquished jurisdiction (Rule 51 para. 2 (a) and (b)). On 28 January 1994, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the ten additional judges called on to complete the Grand Chamber, namely Mr R. Macdonald, Mr A. Spielmann, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr R. Pekkanen, Mr A.N. Loizou, Mr A.B. Baka, Mr J. Makarczyk, Mr P. Jambrek and Mr K. Jungwiert (Rule 51 para. 2 (c)). Mr Pettiti, a member of the original Chamber, was unable to take part in the Grand Chamber’s consideration of the case and was replaced by Mr F. Gölcüklü in accordance with the drawing of lots effected under Rule 51 para. 2 (c). Mr Valticos, also a member of the original Chamber, was prevented at a later stage from continuing to take part in the Grand Chamber’s deliberations.\r\n8.  The Grand Chamber held a meeting devoted to procedural matters on 24 March 1994.\r\nHaving taken note of the concurring opinions of the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the applicants, the Grand Chamber decided on 23 April 1994 that the consideration of the case should continue without resumption of the oral proceedings (Rule 26).\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.  PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\nA. Introduction\r\n9.  The six applicants are members of the same family. The first applicant, Mrs Margaret Murray, and the second applicant, Mr Thomas Murray, are husband and wife. The other four applicants are their children, namely their son Mark Murray (born in 1964), their twin daughters Alana and Michaela Murray (born in 1967) and a younger daughter Rossina Murray (born in 1970). At the relevant time in 1982 all six applicants resided together in the same house in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\r\n10.  On 22 June 1982 two of the first applicant’s brothers were convicted in the United States of America (\"USA\") of arms offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (\"Provisional IRA\"). The Provisional IRA is included among the organisations proscribed under the special legislation enacted in the United Kingdom to deal with terrorism in Northern Ireland (see paragraph 35 below).\r\nB. First applicant’s arrest\r\n11.  On 26 July 1982 at approximately 6.30 a.m. Corporal D., a member of the Women’s Royal Army Corps, attended an Army briefing at which she was told that the first applicant was suspected of involvement in the collection of money for the purchase of arms for the IRA in the USA, this being a criminal offence under section 21 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 (\"the 1978 Act\") and section 10 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976. The corporal was instructed to go to the first applicant’s house, arrest her under section 14 of the 1978 Act (see paragraphs 36-38 below) and bring her back to the Army screening centre at Springfield Road in Belfast.\r\n12.  At 7 a.m. Corporal D., who was unarmed but accompanied by five armed soldiers, arrived by Army vehicle at the applicants’ home. The first applicant herself answered the door and three of the male soldiers, together with Corporal D., entered the house. Corporal D. established the identity of the first applicant and asked her to get dressed. Corporal D. went upstairs with the first applicant. The other applicants were roused and asked to assemble in the living room. The soldiers did not carry out any search of the contents of the house, but made written notes as to the interior of the house and recorded personal details concerning the applicants. At about 7.30 a.m. in the hallway of the house Corporal D., with one of the soldiers acting as a witness, said to the first applicant, \"As a member of Her Majesty’s forces, I arrest you.\" On being asked twice by the first applicant under what section, Corporal D. replied, \"Section 14.\"\r\nC. First applicant’s questioning\r\n13.  The first applicant was then driven to the Army screening centre at Springfield Road, Belfast. She was escorted into a building and asked to sit for a short time in a small cubicle. At 8.05 a.m. she was taken before Sergeant B. who asked her questions with a view to completing part 1 of a standard form to record, inter alia, details of the arrest and screening procedure and personal details. The first applicant refused to answer any questions save to give her name and she refused to be photographed. The interview ended four minutes later. She was then examined by a medical orderly who endeavoured to establish whether she suffered from certain illnesses, but she again refused to co-operate and did not answer any of his questions.\r\n14.  At 8.20 a.m. she was taken to an interview room and questioned by a soldier in civilian clothes in the presence of Corporal D. She was asked, inter alia, about her brothers and her contacts with them, but she still refused to answer questions. After the interview, which ended at 9.35 a.m., she was returned to the reception area and then taken back to the medical orderly who asked her if she had any complaints. She did not reply to this query.\r\nAt some stage during her stay in the centre she was photographed without her knowledge or consent. This photograph and the personal details about her, her family and her home were kept on record.\r\nShe was released at 9.45 a.m. without being charged.\r\n15.  The standard record form, called the \"screening proforma\", recorded the first applicant’s name, address, nationality, marital and tenancy status, the chronological details about her arrest, the names of the Army personnel involved, the names of the other applicants and their relationship to her, her physique and her attitude to the interview. Under the heading \"Additional information ... concerning the arrestee (as reported by the arresting soldier)\", it stated: \"Subject is the sister of C... M... who was arrested in USA. Questioned on the above subject.\" Nothing however was recorded under the heading \"Suspected offence\". It noted that the applicant had refused to answer questions and that no information had been gained from the interview.\r\nD. Proceedings before the High Court\r\n16.  Some eighteen months later, on 9 February 1984, the first applicant brought an action against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts.\r\n17.  In those proceedings one of the principal allegations made by the first applicant was that her arrest and detention had been effected unlawfully and for an improper purpose. Her allegations were summarised in the judgment of Murray J. given on 25 October 1985:\r\n\"The plaintiff’s counsel launched a series of attacks on the legality of the plaintiff’s arrest and detention which varied in thrust between the very broad and the very narrow. In the former class, for example, was an attack in which they alleged that the use of section 14 of the [1978 Act] in this case was an example of what they called ‘an institutionalised form of unlawful screening’ by the military authorities, with the intention of obtaining what counsel termed ‘low level intelligence’ from the plaintiff, and without (a) any genuine suspicion on the part of those authorities that she had committed a criminal offence or (b) any genuine intention on their part of questioning her about a criminal offence alleged to have been committed by her.\"\r\n18.  In support of this case the first applicant’s counsel not only called and examined the applicant herself but extensively cross-examined the two witnesses called on behalf of the defendants, namely Corporal D. and Sergeant B.\r\n19.  The evidence given by the first applicant is recorded in a note drafted by the trial judge, there being no transcript of the first day of the trial as a result of a technical mishap with the recording equipment. The first applicant explained how she had found the conditions of her arrest and detention distressing for her. She had been angry but had not used strong language. She testified that whilst at the Army centre she had refused to be photographed, to be weighed by the medical orderly, to sign any documents and to answer questions, whether put by Sergeant B., the medical orderly or the interviewer, apart from giving her name. She had made it clear that she would not be answering any questions. She alleged that Sergeant B. had told her in so many words that the Army knew that she had not committed any crime but that her file had been lost and the Army wanted to update it. She said that she had been questioned about her brothers in the USA, their whereabouts and her contacts with them, but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence. She accepted that she had been in contact with her brothers and had been to the USA, including a visit that year (1985). She believed that the Army had wanted to obtain information about her brothers. On leaving the centre, she had told the officials that she would be seeing them in court.\r\n20.  As appears from the transcript of her evidence, Corporal D. gave an account of her briefing on the morning of the arrest. She stated that at the briefing she had been told the first applicant’s name and address and the grounds on which she was wanted for questioning, namely her suspected involvement in the collection of money for the purchase of weapons from America. She testified that \"my suspicions were aroused by my briefing, and my belief was that Mrs Murray was suspected of collecting money to purchase arms\".\r\nUnder cross-examination Corporal D. maintained that the purpose of an arrest and detention under section 14 of the 1978 Act was not to gather intelligence but to question a suspected person about an offence. She stated that her suspicion of the first applicant had been formed on the basis of everything she had been told at the briefing and which she had read in a document which had been supplied to her then. Corporal D. stated that she would not have effected the arrest unless she had been given the grounds on which she was expected to arrest the person. Under repeated questioning, Corporal D. maintained that she had been informed at the briefing, and that she had formed the suspicion, that the applicant had been involved in the collection of money for the purchase of arms from America.\r\n21.  Corporal D. was further examined about the interrogation of the first applicant at Springfield Road. She stated that she recalled that questions had been asked of the applicant by the interviewer and that the applicant had refused to answer any questions put to her. She recalled that the interviewer had asked a few more questions when he returned to the room after leaving it but that she could not really remember what they were about. Counsel for the defence returned to the question of the interview of the applicant towards the end of his examination of Corporal D. in the following exchange:\r\nQ.  \"... Now while you were, just going back for a moment to the time when what I might call the interview, that’s when the three of you were in the room, and the two occasions you’ve said she had to leave, you took her to, she wanted to go to the lavatory. Do you just have no recollection of any of the questions that were asked?\"\r\nA.  \"I don’t remember the questions as they were asked. There was a question regards money. A question regards America.\"\r\nNo cross-examination by the first applicant’s counsel was directed to this reply of the witness.\r\n22.  Sergeant B. was examined and cross-examined about his completion of part 1 of the standard record form when standing at the reception desk. He said that the first applicant had stated her name but refused to give her address or date of birth or any further information. He expressly denied the applicant’s allegation that he had said to her that he knew she was not a criminal and that he just wanted to update her files which had been lost. He gave evidence that information recorded in 1980 on the occasion of a previous arrest of the first applicant had in any event not been lost, since it had been used to complete the details on the first page of the form when she had refused to answer any questions.\r\nUnder cross-examination Sergeant B. did not accept that the main purpose of questioning a person arrested under section 14 of the 1978 Act was to gather general information about the background, family and associates of the arrested person. He maintained that persons were only arrested and detained if there existed a suspicion against them of involvement in a criminal offence.\r\n23.  The issue of the interview of the first applicant was specifically addressed in the final submission of defence counsel, in which the following exchange is partially recorded in the transcript:\r\n\"MR. CAMPBELL: My Lord ... your Lordship has the grounds upon which the arresting officer carries out (inaudible) she then gives evidence and is present throughout the interview ... now I talk about the interview on the very last stage.\r\nJUDGE: At the table?\r\nMR. CAMPBELL: At the table, and said that in the course of that interview money and arms that these matters were raised, I can’t ... hesitate to use the (inaudible) now that is one point. The other point is this, that this was a lady who on her own admission was not going to answer any questions. She agreed during cross-examination that that was the attitude and so one finds that an interview takes place with somebody who is not prepared to answer any questions but at least the questions are raised with her concerning the matter on which she was arrested.\r\nJUDGE: Is the substance of that then that because of her fairly firm refusal you would say to answer any questions there was never any probing examination of her collecting money for example?\r\nMR. CAMPBELL: No my Lord because she ... as she said she wasn’t going to answer any questions.\"\r\n24.  In his judgment of 25 October 1985 Murray J. gave detailed consideration to the evidence of Corporal D. and Sergeant B. on the one hand and the first applicant on the other. Murray J. \"could not possibly accept the [first applicant’s] evidence\" that she had been told by Sergeant B. that she was not suspected of any offence and that he was just updating his records. He similarly rejected the applicant’s claim that Corporal D. at no time genuinely suspected her of having committed an offence. In the light of the evidence of Corporal D. herself, who was described as a \"transparently honest witness\", the judge was\r\n\"quite satisfied that on the basis of her briefing at Musgrave Park she genuinely suspected the [first applicant] of having been involved in the offence of collecting money in Northern Ireland for arms\".\r\n25.  Murray J. also rejected the first applicant’s claim that section 14 of the 1978 Act had been used with a view to screening in order to gain low-level intelligence: he accepted the evidence of Corporal D. and Sergeant B., which had been tested in cross-examination, that the purpose of the applicant’s arrest and detention under the section had been to establish facts concerning the offence of which she was suspected.\r\nMurray J. also believed the evidence of Corporal D. that there were questions addressed to the matters of which the applicant was suspected. He stated:\r\n\"As regards the interviewer, the plaintiff accepted that he was interested in the activities of her brothers who shortly before the date of the interview had been convicted on arms charges in the USA connected with the Provisional IRA but the [first applicant], who seems to have been well aware of her rights, obviously had decided not to co-operate with the military staff in the centre. In particular she had decided (it seems) not to answer any of their questions and in this situation, and with the short detention period permitted by the section, there was little that the interviewer or any of the other staff in the centre could do to pursue their suspicions.\"\r\n26.  Murray J. likewise rejected the first applicant’s argument that the photographing of her gave rise to a cause of action. His understanding of the law was that merely taking the photograph of a person, even against their will, without physically interfering with or defaming the person was not tortious.\r\n27.  The first applicant’s action before the High Court was therefore dismissed.\r\nE. Proceedings before the Court of Appeal\r\n28.  The first applicant thereupon appealed to the Court of Appeal. She again challenged the legality of her arrest on the grounds, inter alia\r\n\"(1) that the arresting officer did not have, or was not sufficiently proved to have, the requisite suspicion; (2) that she did not have sufficiently detailed knowledge or understanding of what was alleged against the plaintiff to warrant the conclusion that it was an offence which would justify arrest\".\r\nIn its judgment of 20 February 1987 the Court of Appeal unanimously rejected both these grounds. In delivering judgment, Gibson LJ noted:\r\n\"[The trial judge had] found, and his finding was amply justified by the evidence, that [Corporal D.] genuinely suspected the plaintiff of having been involved in the offence of collecting money in Northern Ireland for arms to be purchased in America for use by a proscribed organisation.\"\r\nIn particular, as to the second ground Gibson LJ observed:\r\n\"Suspicion is something less than proof, and may exist without evidence, though it must be supported by some reason.\"\r\n29.  The Court of Appeal further unanimously rejected the first applicant’s complaint that the purpose of her arrest and detention, and the whole purport of her questioning, was a fishing expedition unrelated to the matters of which she was suspected and designed to obtain low-grade intelligence about the applicant and others. In rejecting this complaint, the Court of Appeal took account of the evidence which had been adduced on both sides:\r\n\"Corporal D. who was present during the interview had very little recollection of the course of the questions. The only other witness as to the conduct of this interview was the [first applicant]. Her account also is sketchy, though in somewhat more detail. What is clear from both witnesses is that the [first applicant] was deliberately unhelpful and refused to answer most of the questions. What is certain is that she was asked about her brothers ... who in the previous month had been convicted of offences connected with the purchase of firearms in the USA for use by the IRA [and for which offences they had been sentenced to terms of two and three years’ imprisonment]. It is clear that it was for such a purchase that the [first applicant] was suspected of having collected money, as she stated the interviewer asked her whether she was in contact with them. There is no doubt, therefore, that the interviewer did attempt to pursue the subject of the suspicion which had been the occasion for her arrest but was unable to make any headway.\"\r\n30.  The first applicant’s appeal to the Court of Appeal also concerned certain related matters such as the legality of the search of the applicants’ house, in respect of which the Court of Appeal found that there was a sufficient basis in section 14(3) of the 1978 Act (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) below). The Court of Appeal held that the implied authority granted to the Army under section 14 included a power to interrogate a detained person and, as a practical necessity, a power to record personal particulars and details concerning the arrest and detention. It further found that the standard record form known as the \"screening proforma\" contained no information which might not have been relevant to the resolution of the suspicion.\r\nAs regards the applicant’s complaint that she had been photographed without her knowledge, the Court of Appeal stated as follows:\r\n\"The act of taking the photograph involved nothing in the nature of a physical assault. Whether such an act would constitute an invasion of privacy so as to be actionable in the United States is irrelevant, because the [first applicant] can only recover damages if it amounts to a tort falling within one of the recognised branches of the law on the topic. According to the common law there is no remedy if someone takes a photograph of another against his will. Reliance was placed on section 11(4) of the [1978] Act by counsel for the [first applicant] ... This provision gives power to the police to order [in addition to the taking of a photograph] the taking of finger prints without the necessity of charging the person concerned and applying for an order of the magistrate under article 61 of the Magistrates Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, which contains no comparable provision as to the taking of photographs. The taking of finger prints otherwise than by consent must involve an assault and I am satisfied that section 11(4) was enacted not to legalise the taking of photographs without consent, but to legalise the taking of photographs or finger prints in circumstances where there would otherwise have been an illegal assault. It does not involve the implication that the taking of a photograph without violence and without consent is actionable.\"\r\nF. Proceedings before the House of Lords\r\n31.  The first applicant was granted leave by the Court of Appeal to appeal to the House of Lords. This appeal was rejected on 25 May 1988 (Murray v. Ministry of Defence, [1988] Weekly Law Reports 692).\r\n32.  In the House of Lords the applicant did not pursue the allegation that she had not been arrested on the basis of a genuine and honest suspicion that she had committed an offence.\r\nShe did however pursue the complaint, previously raised before the Court of Appeal, that since she was only lawfully arrested at 7.30 a.m. she had been unlawfully detained between 7.00 and 7.30 a.m. The House of Lords found that a person is arrested from the moment he is subject to restraint and that the first applicant was therefore under arrest from the moment that Corporal D. identified her on entering the house at 7 a.m.. It made no difference that the formal words of arrest were communicated to the applicant at 7.30 a.m. In this respect Lord Griffiths stated (at pp. 698H-699A):\r\n\"If the plaintiff had been told she was under arrest the moment she identified herself, it would not have made the slightest difference to the sequence of events before she left the house. It would have been wholly unreasonable to take her off, half-clad, to the Army centre, and the same half-hour would have elapsed while she gathered herself together and completed her toilet and dressing. It would seem a strange result that in these circumstances, whether or not she has an action for false imprisonment should depend upon whether the words of arrest are spoken on entering or leaving the house, when the practical effect of the difference on the plaintiff is non-existent.\"\r\n33.  The first applicant had also maintained that the failure to inform her that she was arrested until the soldiers were about to leave the house rendered the arrest unlawful. This submission was also rejected by the House of Lords. Lord Griffiths held as follows (at pp. 699H-701A):\r\n\"It is a feature of the very limited power of arrest contained in section 14 that a member of the armed forces does not have to tell the arrested person the offence of which he is suspected, for it is specifically provided by section 14(2) that it is sufficient if he states that he is effecting the arrest as a member of Her Majesty’s forces.\r\nCorporal D. was carrying out this arrest in accordance with the procedures in which she had been instructed to make a house arrest pursuant to section 14. This procedure appears to me to be designed to make the arrest with the least risk of injury to those involved including both the soldiers and the occupants of the house. When arrests are made on suspicion of involvement with the IRA it would be to close one’s eyes to the obvious not to appreciate the risk that the arrest may be forcibly resisted.\r\nThe drill the Army follow is to enter the house and search every room for occupants. The occupants are all directed to assemble in one room, and when the person the soldiers have come to arrest has been identified and is ready to leave, the formal words of arrest are spoken just before they leave the house. The Army do not carry out a search for property in the house and, in my view, they would not be justified in doing so. The power of search is given ‘for the purpose of arresting a person’, not for a search for incriminating evidence. It is however a proper exercise of the power of search for the purpose of effecting the arrest to search every room for other occupants of the house in case there may be those there who are disposed to resist the arrest. The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I also regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. As Corporal D. explained in evidence, this procedure is followed because the soldiers may be distracted by other occupants in the house rushing from one room to another, perhaps in a state of alarm, perhaps for the purpose of raising the alarm and to resist the arrest. In such circumstances a tragic shooting accident might all too easily happen with young, and often relatively inexperienced, armed soldiers operating under conditions of extreme tension. Your Lordships were told that the husband and children either had commenced, or were contemplating commencing, actions for false imprisonment arising out of the fact that they were asked to assemble in the living-room for a short period before the plaintiff was taken from the house. That very short period of restraint when they were asked to assemble in the living room was a proper and necessary part of the procedure for effecting the peaceable arrest of the plaintiff. It was a temporary restraint of very short duration imposed not only for the benefit of those effecting the arrest, but also for the protection of the occupants of the house and would be wholly insufficient to found an action for unlawful imprisonment.\r\nIt was in my opinion entirely reasonable to delay speaking the words of arrest until the party was about to leave the house. If words of arrest are spoken as soon as the house is entered before any precautions have been taken to search the house and find the other occupants, it seems to me that there is a real risk that the alarm may be raised and an attempt made to resist arrest, not only by those within the house but also by summoning assistance from those in the immediate neighbourhood. When soldiers are employed on the difficult and potentially dangerous task of carrying out a house arrest of a person suspected of an offence in connection with the IRA, it is I think essential that they should have been trained in the drill they are to follow. It would be impracticable and I think potentially dangerous to leave it to the individual discretion of the particular soldier making the arrest to devise his own procedures for carrying out this unfamiliar military function. It is in everyone’s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the Army are sensible, reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned. I would however add this rider: that if the suspect, for any reason, refuses to accept the fact of restraint in the house he should be informed forthwith that he is under arrest.\"\r\n34.  Before the House of Lords the first applicant also pursued a claim that her period of detention exceeded what was reasonably required to make a decision whether to release her or hand her over to the police. In this regard the applicant complained that the standard record form (the \"screening proforma\") constituted an improper basis for questioning a suspect on the ground that it asked questions not directly relevant to the suspected offence; it was also suggested that the evidence did not show that the questioning of the applicant was directed to the matters of which she was suspected. The allegation was unanimously rejected by the House of Lords. Lord Griffiths observed as follows (at pp. 703F-704C):\r\n\"The member of the forces who carried out the interrogation between 8.20 and 9.35 a.m. was not called as a witness on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. There may have been sound reasons for this decision associated with preserving the confidentiality of interrogating techniques and the identity of the interviewer, but be that as it may, the only evidence of what took place at the interview came from Corporal D. and the [first applicant] and it is submitted that this evidence is insufficient to establish that the interview was directed towards an attempt to investigate the suspicion upon which the [applicant] was arrested. Corporal D. was present at that interview, she was not paying close attention but she gave evidence that she remembered questions about money which were obviously directed towards the offences of which the [applicant] was suspected. The [applicant] also said she was questioned about her brothers.\r\nThe judge also had before him a questionnaire that was completed by the interviewer. ... There is nothing in the questionnaire which the Army may not reasonably ask the suspect together with such particular questions as are appropriate to the particular case ...\"\r\nThe conclusion of the trial judge that the applicant had not been asked unnecessary or unreasonable questions and the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the interviewer had attempted to pursue with the applicant the suspicion which had been the occasion of the arrest, but had been unable to make any headway, were held by the House of Lords to be justified on the evidence.\r\nII.  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\r\nA. Introduction\r\n35.  For more than twenty years the population of Northern Ireland, which totals about one and a half million people, has been subjected to a campaign of terrorism. During that time thousands of persons in Northern Ireland have been killed, maimed or injured. The campaign of terror has extended to the rest of the United Kingdom and to the mainland of Europe.\r\nThe 1978 Act forms part of the special legislation enacted over the years in an attempt to enable the security forces to deal effectively with the threat of terrorist violence.\r\nB. Entry and search; arrest and detention\r\n36.  The first applicant was arrested under section 14 of the 1978 Act, which at the relevant time provided as follows:\r\n\"(1) A member of Her Majesty’s forces on duty may arrest without warrant, and detain for not more than four hours, a person whom he suspects of committing, having committed or being about to commit any offence.\r\n (2) A person effecting an arrest under this section complies with any rule of law requiring him to state the ground of arrest if he states that he is effecting the arrest as a member of Her Majesty’s forces.\r\n(3) For the purpose of arresting a person under this section a member of Her Majesty’s forces may enter and search any premises or other place -\r\n(a) where that person is, or\r\n(b) if that person is suspected of being a terrorist or of having committed an offence involving the use or possession of an explosive, explosive substance or firearm, where that person is suspected of being.\"\r\nA similar provision had been in force since 1973 and had been considered necessary to deal with terrorist activities in two independent reviews (Report of the Diplock Commission 1972 which recommended such a power and a Committee chaired by Lord Gardiner 1974/1975).\r\n37.  In 1983 Sir George Baker, a retired senior member of the judiciary, was invited by the Government to review the operation of the 1978 Act in order to determine whether its provisions struck the right balance between the need, on the one hand, to maintain as fully as possible the liberties of the individual and, on the other, to provide the security forces and the courts with adequate powers to enable them to protect the public from current and foreseeable incidence of terrorist crime. In the resultant report specific consideration was given to, inter alia, including a requirement in section 14 of the 1978 Act that an arrest should be based upon reasonable suspicion. While expressly recognising the risk that the facts raising the suspicion might come from a confidential source which could not be disclosed in court in a civil action for wrongful arrest, Sir George Baker concluded that the inclusion of a requirement of reasonableness would not in fact make any difference to the actions of the military and recommended an amendment to the 1978 Act accordingly. That recommendation was implemented in June 1987.\r\n38.  The scope and exercise of the section 14 powers were considered by the domestic courts in the proceedings in the present case. The applicable law, as stated by the judgments in these proceedings, is that when the legality of an arrest or detention under section 14 is challenged (whether by way of habeas corpus or in proceedings for damages for wrongful arrest or false imprisonment), the burden lies on the military to justify their acts and, in particular, to establish the following elements:\r\n(a) compliance with the formal requirements for arrest;\r\n(b) the genuineness of the suspicion on which the arrest was based;\r\n(c) that the powers of arrest and detention were not used for any improper purpose such as intelligence-gathering;\r\n(d) that the power of search was used only to facilitate the arrest and not for the obtaining of incriminating evidence;\r\n(e) that those responsible for the arrest and detention did not exceed the time reasonably required to reach a decision whether to release the detainee or hand him over to the police.\r\nC. Photograph\r\n39.  Section 11 of the 1978 Act, which concerns police arrest, provides in paragraph 4:\r\n\"Where a person is arrested under this section, an officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary not below the rank of chief inspector may order him to be photographed and to have his finger and palm prints taken by a constable, and a constable may use such reasonable force as may be necessary for that purpose.\"\r\n40.  In the general law of Northern Ireland, as in English law, it is lawful to take a photograph of a person without his or her consent, provided no force is used and the photograph is not exploited in such a way as to defame the person concerned (see paragraphs 26 and 30 in fine above).\r\nThe common-law rule entitling the Army to take a photograph equally provides the legal basis for its retention.\r\nD. Standard record form\r\n41.  As was confirmed in particular by the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in the present case, the standard record form (known as the \"screening proforma\") was an integral part of the examination of the first applicant following her arrest, and the legal authority for recording certain personal details about her in the form derived from the lawfulness of her arrest, detention and examination under section 14 of the 1978 Act (see paragraph 30, first sub-paragraph in fine, and paragraph 34 above). The implied lawful authority conferred by section 14 of the 1978 Act to record information about the first applicant equally provided the legal basis for the retention of the information.\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n42.  The applicants applied to the Commission on 28 September 1988 (application no. 14310/88).\r\nThe first applicant complained that her arrest and detention for two hours for questioning gave rise to a violation of Article 5 paras. 1 and 2 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), for which she had no enforceable right to compensation as guaranteed by Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5); and that the taking and keeping of a photograph and personal details about her was in breach of her right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8).\r\nThe other five applicants alleged a violation of Article 5 paras. 1, 2 and 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5) as a result of being required to assemble for half an hour in one room of their house while the first applicant prepared to leave with the Army. They further argued that the recording and retention of certain personal details about them, such as their names and relationship to the first applicant, violated their right to respect for private life under Article 8 (art. 8).\r\nAll six applicants claimed that the entry into and search of their home by the Army were contrary to their right to respect for their private and family life and their home under Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention; and that, contrary to Article 13 (art. 13), no effective remedies existed under domestic law in respect of their foregoing complaints under the Convention.\r\nThe applicants also made complaints under Article 3 and Article 5 para. 3 (art. 3, art. 5-3), which they withdrew subsequently on 11 April 1990.\r\n43.  On 10 December 1991 the Commission declared admissible all the first applicant’s complaints and the other applicants’ complaint under Article 8 (art. 8) in connection with the entry into and search of the family home. The remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.\r\n44.  In its report of 17 February 1993 (Article 31) (art. 31) the Commission expressed the opinion that\r\n(a) in the case of the first applicant, there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) (eleven votes to three), Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (ten votes to four) and Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) (eleven votes to three);\r\n(b) there had been no violation of Article 8 (art. 8) (thirteen votes to one);\r\n(c) it was not necessary to examine further the first applicant’s complaint under Article 13 (art. 13) concerning remedies for arrest, detention and the lack of information about the reasons for arrest;\r\n(d) in the case of the first applicant, there had been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13) in relation to either the entry into and search of her home (unanimously) or the taking and keeping of a photograph and personal details about her (ten votes to four).\r\nThe full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three partly dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n45.  At the public hearing on 24 January 1994 the Government maintained in substance the concluding submission set out in their memorial, whereby they invited the Court to hold\r\n\"(1) that there has been no violation of Article 5 paras. 1, 2 or 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5) of the Convention in the case of the [first] applicant;\r\n (2) that there has been no violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention in the case of the [first] applicant or in the cases of the other applicants;\r\n (3) that there has been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention in relation to the [first] applicant’s complaints concerning entry and search of her home and concerning the taking and retention of a photograph and personal details;\r\n (4) that there has been no violation of Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention in relation to the [first] applicant’s complaints concerning her arrest; alternatively, if a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) is found, that no separate issue arises under Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention\".\r\n \r\n  . Note by the Registrar.  For practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printed version of the judgment (volume 300-A of Series A of the Publications of the Court), but a copy of the Commission's report is obtainable from the registry.\r\n46.  On the same occasion the applicants likewise maintained in substance the conclusions and requests formulated at the close of their memorial, whereby they requested the Court\r\n\"to decide and declare:\r\n(1)  that the facts disclose breaches of paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 of Article 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5) of the Convention;\r\n(2)  that the facts disclose a breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention;\r\n(3)  that the facts disclose a breach of Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention\".\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.  GENERAL APPROACH\r\n47.  The applicants’ complaints concern the first applicant’s arrest and detention by the Army under special criminal legislation enacted to deal with acts of terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland. As has been noted in several previous judgments by the Court, the campaign of terrorism waged in Northern Ireland over the last quarter of a century has taken a terrible toll, especially in terms of human life and suffering (see paragraph 35 above).\r\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the general approach it has adopted in previous cases of a similar nature. Accordingly, for the purposes of interpreting and applying the relevant provisions of the Convention, due account will be taken of the special nature of terrorist crime, the threat it poses to democratic society and the exigencies of dealing with it (see, inter alia, the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182, p. 15, para. 28, citing the Brogan and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 29 November 1988, Series A no. 145-B, p. 27, para. 48).\r\nII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 1 (art. 5-1) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n48.  The first applicant, Mrs Margaret Murray, alleged that her arrest and detention by the Army were in breach of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention, which, in so far as relevant, provides:\r\n\"Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:\r\n...\r\n(c) the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence ...\r\n...\"\r\nA. Lawfulness\r\n49.  Before the Convention institutions the first applicant did not dispute that her arrest and detention were \"lawful\" under Northern Ireland law and, in particular, \"in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law\", as required by Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1). She submitted that she had not been arrested on \"reasonable suspicion\" of having committed a criminal offence and that the purpose of her arrest and subsequent detention had not been to bring her before a competent legal authority within the meaning of paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).\r\nB. \"Reasonable suspicion\"\r\n50.  Mrs Murray was arrested and detained by virtue of section 14 of the 1978 Act (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above). This provision, as construed by the domestic courts, empowered the Army to arrest and detain persons suspected of the commission of an offence provided, inter alia, that the suspicion of the arresting officer was honestly and genuinely held (see paragraphs 36 and 38(b) above). It is relevant but not decisive that the domestic legislation at the time merely imposed this essentially subjective standard: the Court’s task is to determine whether the objective standard of \"reasonable suspicion\" laid down in Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) was met in the circumstances of the application of the legislation in the particular case.\r\n51.  In its judgment in the above-mentioned case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, which was concerned with arrests carried out by the Northern Ireland police under a similarly worded provision of the 1978 Act, the Court stated as follows (pp. 16-18, paras. 32 and 34):\r\n\"The ‘reasonableness’ of the suspicion on which an arrest must be based forms an essential part of the safeguard against arbitrary arrest and detention which is laid down in Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c). ... [H]aving a \"reasonable suspicion\" presupposes the existence of facts or information which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. What may be regarded as ‘reasonable’ will however depend upon all the circumstances.\r\nIn this respect, terrorist crime falls into a special category. Because of the attendant risk of loss of life and human suffering, the police are obliged to act with utmost urgency in following up all information, including information from secret sources. Further, the police may frequently have to arrest a suspected terrorist on the basis of information which is reliable but which cannot, without putting in jeopardy the source of the information, be revealed to the suspect or produced in court to support a charge.\r\n... [I]n view of the difficulties inherent in the investigation and prosecution of terrorist-type offences in Northern Ireland, the ‘reasonableness’ of the suspicion justifying such arrests cannot always be judged according to the same standards as are applied in dealing with conventional crime. Nevertheless, the exigencies of dealing with terrorist crime cannot justify stretching the notion of ‘reasonableness’ to the point where the essence of the safeguard secured by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is impaired ...\r\n...\r\nCertainly Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention should not be applied in such a manner as to put disproportionate difficulties in the way of the police authorities of the Contracting States in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism ... . It follows that the Contracting States cannot be asked to establish the reasonableness of the suspicion grounding the arrest of a suspected terrorist by disclosing the confidential sources of supporting information or even facts which would be susceptible of indicating such sources or their identity.\r\nNevertheless the Court must be enabled to ascertain whether the essence of the safeguard afforded by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) has been secured. Consequently, the respondent Government have to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence. This is all the more necessary where, as in the present case, the domestic law does not require reasonable suspicion, but sets a lower threshold by merely requiring honest suspicion.\"\r\nOn the facts the Court found in that case that, although the arrest and detention of the three applicants, which lasted respectively forty-four hours, forty-four hours and five minutes and thirty hours and fifteen minutes, were based on an honest suspicion, insufficient elements had been furnished by the Government to support the conclusion that there had been a \"reasonable suspicion\" for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (ibid., p. 18, para. 35).\r\n52.  In the present case the Government maintained that there existed strong and specific grounds, founded on information from a reliable but secret source, for the Army to suspect that Mrs Murray was involved in the collection of funds for terrorist purposes. However, the \"primary\" information so provided could not be revealed in the interests of protecting lives and personal safety. In the Government’s submission, the fact that they had maintained that this was the foundation of the suspicion should be given considerable weight by the Court. They also pointed to a number of other facts capable of supporting, albeit indirectly, the reasonableness of the suspicion, including notably the findings made by the domestic courts in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, the very recent conviction of her brothers in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her own visits to the USA and her contacts with her brothers there (see especially paragraphs 10, 19, 24, 25, 28 and 29 above). They submitted that all these matters taken together provided sufficient facts and information to satisfy an objective observer that there was a reasonable suspicion in the circumstances of the case. Any other conclusion by the Court would, they feared, prohibit arresting authorities from effecting an arrest of a person suspected of being a terrorist based primarily on reliable but secret information and would inhibit the arresting authorities in taking effective measures to counter organised terrorism.\r\n53.  The first applicant, on the other hand, considered that the Government had failed to discharge the onus of disclosing sufficient facts to enable the Convention institutions to conclude that the suspicion grounding her arrest was reasonable or anything more than the \"honest\" suspicion required under Northern Ireland law. As in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Government’s explanation did not meet the minimum standards set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) for judging the reasonableness of her arrest and detention. She did not accept that the reason advanced for non-disclosure was a genuine or valid one. She in her turn pointed to circumstances said to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the suspicion. Thus, had the suspicion really been reasonable, she would not have been arrested under the four-hour power granted by section 14 of the 1978 Act but under more extensive powers; she would have been questioned by the police, not the Army; time would not have been spent in gathering personal details and in photographing her; she would have been questioned for more than one hour and fifteen minutes; she would have been questioned about her own alleged involvement and not just about her brothers in the USA; and she would have been cautioned. In reply to the Government the first applicant contended that the issue which the domestic courts inquired into was not the objective reasonableness of any suspicion but the subjective state of mind of the arresting officer, Corporal D.\r\n54.  For the Commission, the Government’s explanation in the present case was not materially distinguishable from that provided in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley. It took the view that no objective evidence to corroborate the unrevealed information had been adduced in support of the suspicion that the first applicant had been involved in collecting money for Provisional IRA arms purchases other than her kinship with her convicted brothers. That, the Commission concluded, was insufficient to satisfy the minimum standard set by Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).\r\n55.  With regard to the level of \"suspicion\", the Court would note firstly that, as was observed in its judgment in the case of Brogan and Others, \"sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) does not presuppose that the [investigating authorities] should have obtained sufficient evidence to bring charges, either at the point of arrest or while [the arrested person is] in custody. Such evidence may have been unobtainable or, in view of the nature of the suspected offences, impossible to produce in court without endangering the lives of others\" (loc. cit., p. 29, para. 53). The object of questioning during detention under sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) is to further the criminal investigation by way of confirming or dispelling the concrete suspicion grounding the arrest. Thus, facts which raise a suspicion need not be of the same level as those necessary to justify a conviction or even the bringing of a charge, which comes at the next stage of the process of criminal investigation.\r\n56.  The length of the deprivation of liberty at risk may also be material to the level of suspicion required. The period of detention permitted under the provision by virtue of which Mrs Murray was arrested, namely section 14 of the 1978 Act, was limited to a maximum of four hours.\r\n57.  With particular regard to the \"reasonableness\" of the suspicion, the principles stated in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment are to be applied in the present case, although as pointed out in that judgment, the existence or not of a reasonable suspicion in a concrete instance depends ultimately on the particular facts.\r\n58.  The Court would firstly reiterate its recognition that the use of confidential information is essential in combating terrorist violence and the threat that organised terrorism poses to the lives of citizens and to democratic society as a whole (see also the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 23, para. 48). This does not mean, however, that the investigating authorities have carte blanche under Article 5 (art. 5) to arrest suspects for questioning, free from effective control by the domestic courts or by the Convention supervisory institutions, whenever they choose to assert that terrorism is involved (ibid., p. 23, para. 49).\r\n59.  As to the present case, the terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland, the carnage it has caused over the years and the active engagement of the Provisional IRA in that campaign are established beyond doubt. The Court also accepts that the power of arrest granted to the Army by section 14 of the 1978 Act represented a bona fide attempt by a democratically elected parliament to deal with terrorist crime under the rule of law. That finding is not altered by the fact that the terms of the applicable legislation were amended in 1987 as a result of the Baker Report so as to include a requirement that the arrest should be based on reasonable, rather than merely honest, suspicion (see paragraph 37 above).\r\nThe Court is accordingly prepared to attach some credence to the respondent Government’s declaration concerning the existence of reliable but confidential information grounding the suspicion against Mrs Murray.\r\n60.  Nevertheless, in the words of the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, the respondent Government must in addition \"furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence\" (see paragraph 51 above). In this connection, unlike in the case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley, the Convention institutions have had the benefit of the review that the national courts conducted of the facts and of Mrs Murray’s allegations in the civil proceedings brought by her.\r\n61.  It cannot be excluded that all or some of the evidence adduced before the national courts in relation to the genuineness of the suspicion on the basis of which Mrs Murray was arrested may also be material to the issue whether the suspicion was \"reasonable\" for the purposes of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) of the Convention. At the very least the honesty and bona fides of a suspicion constitute one indispensable element of its reasonableness.\r\nIn the action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence for false imprisonment and other torts, the High Court judge, after having heard the witnesses and assessed their credibility, found that she had genuinely been suspected of having been involved in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms in the USA for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 24 above). The judge believed the evidence of the arresting officer, Corporal D, who was described as a \"transparently honest witness\", as to what she had been told at her briefing before the arrest (see paragraphs 11 and 24 above). Likewise as found by the judge, although the interview at the Army centre was later in time than the arrest, the line of questioning pursued by the interviewer also tends to support the conclusion that Mrs Murray herself was suspected of the commission of a specific criminal offence (see paragraphs 14 and 25 above).\r\n62.  Some weeks before her arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had been convicted in the USA of offences connected with purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above). As she disclosed in her evidence to the High Court, she had visited the USA and had contacts with her brothers there (see paragraph 19 above). The offences of which her brothers were convicted were ones that implied collaboration with \"trustworthy\" persons residing in Northern Ireland.\r\n63.  Having regard to the level of factual justification required at the stage of suspicion and to the special exigencies of investigating terrorist crime, the Court finds, in the light of all the above considerations, that there did exist sufficient facts or information which would provide a plausible and objective basis for a suspicion that Mrs Murray may have committed the offence of involvement in the collection of funds for the Provisional IRA. On the particular facts of the present case, therefore, the Court is satisfied that, notwithstanding the lower standard of suspicion under domestic law, Mrs Murray can be said to have been arrested and detained on \"reasonable suspicion\" of the commission of a criminal offence, within the meaning of sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c).\r\nC. Purpose of the arrest\r\n64.  In the first applicant’s submission, it was clear from the surrounding circumstances that she was not arrested for the purpose of bringing her before a \"competent legal authority\" but merely for the purpose of interrogating her with a view to gathering general intelligence. She referred to the entries made in her regard on the standard record form completed at the Army centre (see paragraph 15 above), to the failure of the Army to involve the police in her questioning and to the short (one-hour) period of her questioning (see paragraph 14 above).\r\nThe Government disputed this contention, pointing to the fact that it was a claim expressly raised by Mrs Murray in the domestic proceedings and rejected by the trial judge on the basis of evidence which had been tested by cross-examination of witnesses.\r\nThe Commission in its report did not find it necessary to examine this complaint in view of its conclusion as to the lack of \"reasonable suspicion\" for the arrest and detention.\r\n65.  Under the applicable law of Northern Ireland the power of arrest and detention granted to the Army under section 14 of the 1978 Act may not be used for any improper purpose such as intelligence-gathering (see paragraph 38(c) above). In the civil action brought by Mrs Murray against the Ministry of Defence the trial court judge found that on the evidence before him the purpose of her arrest and detention under section 14 of the 1978 Act had been to establish facts concerning the offence of which she was suspected (see paragraph 25 above). In reaching this conclusion the trial judge had had the benefit of seeing the various witnesses give their evidence and of evaluating their credibility. He accepted the evidence of Corporal D. and Sergeant B. as being truthful and rejected the claims of Mrs Murray, in particular her contention that she had been told by Sergeant B. that she was not suspected of any offence and had been arrested merely in order to bring her file up to date (see paragraphs 19, 20 to 22, 24 and 25 above). The Court of Appeal, after reviewing the evidence, in turn rejected her argument that the purpose of her arrest and detention had been a \"fishing expedition\" designed to obtain low-grade intelligence (see paragraph 29 above). This argument was not pursued before the House of Lords (see paragraph 32 above).\r\n66.  The Court’s task is to determine whether the conditions laid down by paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c), including the pursuit of the prescribed legitimate purpose, have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case. However, in this context it is not normally within the province of the Court to substitute its own finding of fact for that of the domestic courts, which are better placed to assess the evidence adduced before them (see, among other authorities, the X v. the United Kingdom judgment of 5 November 1981, Series A no. 46, pp. 19-20, para. 43, in relation to Article 5 para. 1 (e) (art. 5-1-e); and the Klaas v. Germany judgment of 22 September 1993, Series A no. 269, p. 17, para. 29, in relation to Article 3 (art. 3)). In the present case no cogent elements have been produced by the first applicant in the proceedings before the Convention institutions which could lead the Court to depart from the findings of fact made by the Northern Ireland courts.\r\n67.  Mrs Murray was neither charged nor brought before a court but was released after an interview lasting a little longer than one hour (see paragraph 14 above). This does not necessarily mean, however, that the purpose of her arrest and detention was not in accordance with Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) since \"the existence of such a purpose must be considered independently of its achievement\" (see the above-mentioned Brogan and Others judgment, pp. 29-30, para. 53). As the domestic courts pointed out (see paragraphs 25 in fine, 29 in fine and 34 in fine above), in view of her persistent refusal to answer any questions at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13, 14 and 19 above) it is not surprising that the authorities were not able to make any headway in pursuing the suspicions against her. It can be assumed that, had these suspicions been confirmed, charges would have been laid and she would have been brought before the competent legal authority.\r\n68.  The first applicant also alleged absence of the required proper purpose by reason of the fact that in practice persons arrested by the Army under section 14 were never brought before a competent legal authority by the Army but, if the suspicions were confirmed during questioning, were handed over to the police who preferred charges and took the necessary action to bring the person before a court.\r\nThe Court sees little merit in this argument. What counts for the purpose of compliance with Convention obligations is the substance rather than the form. Provided that the purpose of the arrest and detention is genuinely to bring the person before the competent legal authority, the mechanics of how this is to be achieved will not be decisive.\r\n69.  The arrest and detention of the first applicant must therefore be taken to have been effected for the purpose specified in paragraph 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c).\r\nD. Conclusion\r\n70.  In conclusion, there has been no violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in respect of the first applicant.\r\nIII.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 2 (art. 5-2) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n71.  The first applicant also alleged a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, which provides:\r\n\"Everyone who is arrested shall be informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him.\"\r\n72.  The relevant principles governing the interpretation and application of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) in cases such as the present one were explained by the Court in its Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment as follows (loc. cit., p. 19, para. 40):\r\n\"Paragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty. This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)... . Whilst this information must be conveyed ‘promptly’ (in French: ‘dans le plus court délai’), it need not be related in its entirety by the arresting officer at the very moment of the arrest. Whether the content and promptness of the information conveyed were sufficient is to be assessed in each case according to its special features.\"\r\nIn that case the Court found on the facts that the reasons for the applicants’ arrest had been brought to their attention during their interrogation within a few hours of their arrest. This being so, the requirements of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) were held to have been satisfied in the circumstances (ibid., pp. 19-20, paras. 41-43).\r\n73.  The first applicant maintained that at no time during her arrest or detention had she been given any or sufficient information as to the grounds of her arrest. Although she had realised that the Army was interested in her brothers’ activities, she had not, she claimed, understood from the interview at the Army centre that she herself was suspected of involvement in fund-raising for the Provisional IRA. The only direct information she was given was the formal formula of arrest pronounced by Corporal D.\r\n74.  The Commission similarly took the view that it was impossible to draw any conclusions from what it described as the vague indications given by Corporal D. in evidence before the High Court as to whether the first applicant had been able to understand from the interview why she had been arrested. In the Commission’s opinion, it had not been shown that the questions asked of Mrs Murray during her interview were sufficiently precise to constitute the information as to the reasons for arrest required by Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).\r\n75.  According to the Government, on the other hand, it was apparent from the trial evidence that in the interview it was made clear to Mrs Murray that she was suspected of the offence of collecting money for the Provisional IRA. The Government did not accept the Commission’s conclusion on the facts, which was at variance with the findings of the domestic courts. They considered it established that Mrs Murray had been given sufficient information as to the grounds of her arrest. In the alternative, even if insufficient information had been given to her to avail herself of her right under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention to take legal proceedings to test the lawfulness of her detention, she had suffered no prejudice thereby which would give rise to a breach of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) since she had been released rapidly, before any determination of the lawfulness of her detention could have taken place.\r\n76.  It is common ground that, apart from repeating the formal words of arrest required by law, the arresting officer, Corporal D., also told Mrs Murray the section of the 1978 Act under which the arrest was being carried out (see paragraphs 12 and 36 above). This bare indication of the legal basis for the arrest, taken on its own, is insufficient for the purposes of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) (see the above-mentioned Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 19, para. 41).\r\n77.  During the trial of Mrs Murray’s action against the Ministry of Defence, evidence as to the interview at the Army centre was given by Mrs Murray and Corporal D., but not by the soldier who had conducted the interview (see paragraphs 14, 19 and 21 above). Mrs Murray testified that she had been questioned about her brothers in the USA and about her contacts with them but not about the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA or about any offence (see paragraph 19 above). Corporal D. did not have a precise recollection as to the content of the questions put to Mrs Murray. This is not perhaps surprising since the trial took place over three years after the events - Mrs Murray having waited eighteen months before bringing her action - and Corporal D., although present, had not taken an active part in the interview (see paragraphs 14, 16, 17 and 21 above). Corporal D. did however remember that questions had been asked about money and about America and the trial judge found her to be a \"transparently honest witness\" (see paragraphs 21 and 24 above). Shortly before the arrest two of Mrs Murray’s brothers had, presumably to the knowledge of all concerned in the interview, been convicted in the USA of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA (see paragraph 10 above).\r\nIn the Court’s view, it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA. Admittedly, \"there was never any probing examination of her collecting money\" - to use the words of the trial judge - but, as the national courts noted, this was because of Mrs Murray’s declining to answer any questions at all beyond giving her name (see paragraphs 14, 23, 25, 29 and 34 in fine above). The Court therefore finds that the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview.\r\n78.  Mrs Murray was arrested at her home at 7 a.m. and interviewed at the Army centre between 8.20 a.m. and 9.35 a.m. on the same day (see paragraphs 12 and 14 above). In the context of the present case this interval cannot be regarded as falling outside the constraints of time imposed by the notion of promptness in Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).\r\n79.  In view of the foregoing findings it is not necessary for the Court to examine the Government’s alternative submission.\r\n80.  In conclusion, there was no breach of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) in respect of the first applicant.\r\nIV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 5 PARA. 5 (art. 5-5) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n81.  The first applicant finally alleged in relation to Article 5 a violation of paragraph 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention, which reads:\r\n\"Everyone who has been the victim of arrest or detention in contravention of the provisions of this Article shall have an enforceable right to compensation.\"\r\nThis claim was accepted by the Commission but disputed by the Government. The Commission concluded that there was no enforceable right under Northern Ireland law for the breaches of Article 5 paras. 1 and 2 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2) which it considered to have occurred.\r\n82.  As the Court has found no violation of Article 5 paras. 1 or 2 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), no issue arises under Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5). There has accordingly been no violation of this latter provision in the present case.\r\nV.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 (art. 8) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n83.  All six applicants claimed to be the victims of a violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, which provides:\r\n\"1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\r\n2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"\r\nA. Arguments before the Court\r\n84.  The first applicant complained of the manner in which she was treated both in her home and at the Army centre; in the latter connection she objected to the recording of personal details concerning herself and her family, as well as the photograph which was taken of her without her knowledge or consent (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above). All six applicants contended that the entry into and search of their family home by the Army, including the confinement of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants for a short while in one room, violated Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraph 12 above).\r\n85.  Both the Government and the Commission considered that the matters complained of were justified under paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2) as being lawful measures necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in the context of the fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland.\r\nB. Interference\r\n86.  It was not contested that the impugned measures interfered with the applicants’ exercise of their right to respect for their private and family life and their home.\r\nC. \"In accordance with the law\"\r\n87.  On the other hand, the applicants did not concede that the resultant interferences had been \"in accordance with the law\". They disputed that the impugned measures all formed an integral part of Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention or that the domestic courts had affirmed their lawfulness, in particular as concerns the retention of the records including the photograph of Mrs Murray.\r\n88.  Entry into and search of a home by Army personnel such as occurred in the present case were explicitly permitted by section 14 (3) of the 1978 Act for the purpose of effecting arrests under that section (see paragraphs 36 and 38(d) above). The Court of Appeal upheld the legality of the search in the present case (see paragraph 30 above). The short period of restraint endured by the other members of Mrs Murray’s family when they were asked to assemble in one room was held by the House of Lords to be a necessary and proper part of the procedure of arrest of Mrs Murray (see paragraph 33 above). The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords also confirmed that the Army’s implied lawful authority under section 14 extended to interrogating a detained person and to recording personal details of the kind contained in the standard record form (see paragraph 41 above and also paragraphs 15, 30 and 34). It is implicit in the judgments of the national courts that the retention of such details was covered by the same lawful authority derived from section 14 (see paragraph 41 in fine above). The taking and, by implication, also the retention of a photograph of the first applicant without her consent had no statutory basis but, as explained by the trial court judge and the Court of Appeal, were lawful under the common law (see paragraphs 26, 30, 39 and 40 above).\r\nThe impugned measures thus had a basis in domestic law. The Court discerns no reason, on the material before it, for not concluding that each of the various measures was \"in accordance with the law\", within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\r\nD. Legitimate aim\r\n89.  These measures undoubtedly pursued the legitimate aim of the prevention of crime.\r\nE. Necessity in a democratic society\r\n90.  It remains to be determined whether they were necessary in a democratic society and, in particular, whether the means employed were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. In this connection it is not for the Court to substitute for the assessment of the national authorities its own assessment of what might be the best policy in the field of investigation of terrorist crime (see the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 23, para. 49). A certain margin of appreciation in deciding what measures to take both in general and in particular cases should be left to the national authorities.\r\n91.  The present judgment has already adverted to the responsibility of an elected government in a democratic society to protect its citizens and its institutions against the threats posed by organised terrorism and to the special problems involved in the arrest and detention of persons suspected of terrorist-linked offences (see paragraphs 47, 51 and 58 above). These two factors affect the fair balance that is to be struck between the exercise by the individual of the right guaranteed to him or her under paragraph 1 of Article 8 (art. 8-1) and the necessity under paragraph 2 (art. 8-2) for the State to take effective measures for the prevention of terrorist crimes (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Klass and Others judgment, p. 28, para. 59).\r\n92.  The domestic courts held that Mrs Murray was genuinely and honestly suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime (see paragraphs 24 and 28 above). The European Court, for its part, has found on the evidence before it that this suspicion could be regarded as reasonable for the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) (see paragraph 63 above). The Court accepts that there was in principle a need both for powers of the kind granted by section 14 of the 1978 Act and, in the particular case, to enter and search the home of the Murray family in order to arrest Mrs Murray.\r\nFurthermore, the \"conditions of extreme tension\", as Lord Griffiths put it in his speech in the House of Lords, under which such arrests in Northern Ireland have to be carried out must be recognised. The Court notes the analysis of Lord Griffiths, when he said (see paragraph 33 above):\r\n\"The search cannot be limited solely to looking for the person to be arrested and must also embrace a search whose object is to secure that the arrest should be peaceable. I ... regard it as an entirely reasonable precaution that all the occupants of the house should be asked to assemble in one room. ... It is in everyone’s best interest that the arrest is peaceably effected and I am satisfied that the procedures adopted by the Army are sensible, reasonable and designed to bring about the arrest with the minimum of danger and distress to all concerned.\"\r\nThese are legitimate considerations which go to explain and justify the manner in which the entry into and search of the applicants’ home were carried out. The Court does not find that, in relation to any of the applicants, the means employed by the authorities in this regard were disproportionate to the aim pursued.\r\n93.  Neither can it be regarded as falling outside the legitimate bounds of the process of investigation of terrorist crime for the competent authorities to record and retain basic personal details concerning the arrested person or even other persons present at the time and place of arrest. None of the personal details taken during the search of the family home or during Mrs Murray’s stay at the Army centre would appear to have been irrelevant to the procedures of arrest and interrogation (see paragraphs 12 to 15 above). Similar conclusions apply to the taking and retention of a photograph of Mrs Murray at the Army centre (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above). In this connection too, the Court does not find that the means employed were disproportionate to the aim pursued.\r\n94.  In the light of the particular facts of the case, the Court finds that the various measures complained of can be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).\r\nF. Conclusion\r\n95.  In conclusion there has been no violation of Article 8 (art. 8) in respect of any of the applicants.\r\nVI.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 (art. 13) OF THE CONVENTION\r\n96.  The first applicant submitted that, contrary to Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention, she had no effective remedy under domestic law in respect of her claims under Articles 5 and 8 (art. 5, art. 8). Article 13 (art. 13) reads as follows:\r\n\"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\"\r\nA. Claims as to arrest, detention and lack of information about reasons for arrest (Article 5 paras. 1 and 2) (art. 5-1, art. 5-2)\r\n97.  The Commission did not consider it necessary to examine the complaint under this head on the ground that no separate issue arose under Article 13 (art. 13) in view of its conclusion that Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) had been violated.\r\nThe Government submitted that, if a breach of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) were found, the Commission’s approach was correct but that, if not, the requirements of Article 13 (art. 13) had been satisfied.\r\n98.  Under the Convention scheme of protection of the right to liberty and security of person, the lex specialis as regards entitlement to a remedy is paragraph 4 of Article 5 (art. 5-4) (see the Brannigan and McBride v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258-B, p. 57, para. 76), which provides:\r\n\"Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.\"\r\nThe scope of this specific entitlement in relation to arrest and detention under the emergency legislation in Northern Ireland has been considered by the Court, notably in the Brogan and Others and Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgments (loc. cit., pp. 34-35, para. 65, and pp. 20-21, para. 45, respectively).\r\nNo complaint however was made by the first applicant under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) at any stage of the proceedings before the Convention institutions. The Court sees no cause, either on the facts or in law, to examine whether the less strict requirements of Article 13 (art. 13) were complied with in the present case.\r\nB. Claims as to entry and search (Article 8) (art. 8)\r\n99.  The first applicant argued that effective remedies for her claims under Article 8 (art. 8) regarding the Army’s actions in entering and searching her house were lacking since such domestic proceedings as might have been taken in relation to entry and search would have failed because domestic law provided lawful excuse for those actions.\r\nThe Commission expressed the opinion that an appropriate remedy did exist under domestic law, notably in the form of an action for the tort of unlawful trespass to property.\r\nThe Government accepted and adopted the Commission’s reasoning.\r\n100. The Court likewise arrives at the same conclusion as the Commission. Article 13 (art. 13) guarantees the availability of a remedy at national level to enforce the substance of the Convention rights in whatever form they may happen to be secured in the domestic legal order. Its effect is thus to require the provision of a domestic remedy allowing the competent \"national authority\" both to deal with the substance of the relevant Convention complaint and to grant appropriate relief in meritorious cases (see, inter alia, the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 39, para. 122, and the authorities cited there). The remedy available to Mrs Murray would have satisfied these conditions. As the Commission pointed out, her feeble prospects of success in the light of the particular circumstances of her case do not detract from the \"effectiveness\" of the remedy for the purpose of Article 13 (art. 13) (ibid.).\r\nC. Claims as to the taking and retention of a photograph and personal details (Article 8) (art. 8)\r\n101. As to her claims under Article 8 (art. 8) regarding the taking and retention of a photograph and personal details, the first applicant agreed with the separate opinion of Sir Basil Hall, who took the view that since Northern Ireland law offered no protection for an individual in her position, there being no general right to privacy recognised under that law, Article 13 (art. 13) had been violated.\r\nThe Commission, citing the Court’s case-law (see the James and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1986, Series A no. 98, pp. 47-48, paras. 85-86), concluded that in so far as the first applicant’s complaint was directed against the content of Northern Ireland law, Article 13 (art. 13) did not confer any entitlement to a remedy; and that, if she could be taken to be objecting to the manner in which that law had been applied in her case, she could have brought an action before the Northern Ireland courts.\r\nThe Government accepted and adopted the Commission’s reasoning.\r\n102. On this point too the Court comes to the same conclusion as the Commission.\r\nWhether the relevant domestic law as applied to Mrs Murray ensured her a sufficient level of protection of her right to respect for her private life is a substantive issue under Article 8 (art. 8). The matters complained of by Mrs Murray under Article 8 (art. 8) in this connection have already been found in the present judgment to have been compatible with the requirements of Article 8 (art. 8) (see paragraphs 83 to 95 above). Article 13 (art. 13) for its part does not go so far as to guarantee Mrs Murray a remedy allowing her to have challenged the content of Northern Ireland law before a national authority (see the James and Others judgment, loc. cit.). For the rest, effective remedies were available to her to raise any claim of non-compliance with the applicable domestic law.\r\nD. Conclusion\r\n103. The facts of the present case do not therefore disclose a violation of Article 13 (art. 13) in respect of the first applicant.\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\r\n1.  Holds, by fourteen votes to four, that there has been no breach of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention in respect of the first applicant;\r\n\r\n2.  Holds, by thirteen votes to five, that there has been no breach of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention in respect of the first applicant;\r\n\r\n3.  Holds, by thirteen votes to five, that there has been no breach of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5-) of the Convention in respect of the first applicant;\r\n\r\n4.  Holds, by fifteen votes to three, that there has been no breach of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention in respect of any of the applicants;\r\n\r\n5.  Holds, unanimously, that it is not necessary to examine under Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention the first applicant’s complaint concerning remedies for her claims under Article 5 paras. 1 and 2 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2);\r\n\r\n6.  Holds, unanimously, that, for the rest, there has been no breach of Article 13 (art. 13) of the Convention in respect of the first applicant.\r\n\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 October 1994.\r\n\r\nRolv RYSSDAL\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nActing Registrar\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\r\n(a) joint dissenting opinion of Mr Loizou, Mr Morenilla and  Mr Makarczyk;\r\n(b) partly dissenting opinion of Mr Mifsud Bonnici;\r\n(c) partly dissenting opinion of Mr Jambrek.\r\n\r\nR. R.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES LOIZOU, MORENILLA AND MAKARCZYK\r\n1.  Although we agree with the majority of the Court that, when interpreting and applying the Convention, due account should be taken of the special nature of terrorist crime, of the exigencies of investigating terrorist activities and of the necessity of not jeopardising the confidentiality of reliable sources of information, we cannot concur with its conclusion of no violation of Article 5 paras. 1, 2 and 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5), and Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention in the present case.\r\nOn the contrary, a violation of the applicants’ fundamental rights to liberty and security and to respect for private life is disclosed by the circumstances of the case, namely the Army’s entry into and search of the applicants’ home at 7 a.m. without warrant; the assembling of Mrs Murray’s husband and four children in a room of the house during half an hour; her arrest and detention during two hours for questioning in a military screening centre on suspicion of her involvement in terrorist activities because her brothers had been convicted in the United States of America of offences connected with the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA; and the failure to inform her of the reasons for her arrest (paragraphs 9 to 34 of the judgment).\r\n2.  Regarding the arrest and detention of Mrs Murray, we regret that we are not convinced by the majority’s arguments, particularly in paragraphs 62 and 63, as to the reasonableness of the suspicion that she had committed the above-mentioned offence; nor do we find that the facts of this case are materially different from those in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment , where the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) because it considered the elements furnished by the Government to be insufficient to support the conclusion that there had been a \"reasonable suspicion\" that the arrested persons had committed an offence.\r\n3.  The conviction in the United States of Mrs Murray’s two brothers of offences connected with the purchase of weapons for the Provisional IRA, her visit to her brothers there and the reference to the collaboration with \"trustworthy\" persons residing in Northern Ireland implied by such offences are not, in our opinion, sufficient grounds for reasonably suspecting the first applicant of involvement in the offence of collecting funds in Northern Ireland to buy arms in the United States for terrorist purposes. Family ties cannot imply a criminal relationship between the author of the offence and his or her relatives; nor can the \"co-operative\" nature of the crime be considered a valid basis for a reasonable suspicion of complicity on the part of members of the family or friends of the criminal. These circumstances may give rise only to a bona fide suspicion of such complicity. They do not give rise to a \"reasonable\" suspicion such as to justify the serious measures taken against the applicants unless they are connected with other facts in direct relation to the offence. No facts of this kind have however been furnished by the respondent Government, although, in our opinion, they could have been supplied without jeopardising the confidentiality of the source of information which is necessary to protect the life and personal safety of that source (paragraph 52 of the judgment).\r\n\r\n .

The Court’s task, as stated by the majority (paragraph 66 of the judgment), is to determine whether the conditions laid down by sub-paragraph (c) of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1-c) have been fulfilled in the circumstances of the particular case. With due respect to the review that the national courts have conducted of the facts of the case (paragraph 60 of the judgment) and to their findings and conclusions in the proceedings brought by Mrs Murray, it falls to our Court, pursuant to Article 19 (art. 19) of the Convention, to ensure the observance of the engagement undertaken by the States Parties under Article 1 (art. 1) to secure everyone within their jurisdiction, inter alia, the right to liberty and the right to respect for private life. In the exercise of this power of review the Court must ascertain whether the essence of the safeguard afforded by this provision of the Convention has been secured. \"Consequently, the respondent Government have to furnish at least some facts or information capable of satisfying the Court that the arrested person was reasonably suspected of having committed the alleged offence\" (Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment, p. 18, para. 34).\r\n5.  In the instant case the specific circumstances of the entry into and search of the applicants’ home by the Army, the limited role of the Army in the investigation of terrorist crimes under United Kingdom law (paragraphs 36 to 38 of the judgment) and, moreover, the personal circumstances of Mrs Murray, a mother of four children with health problems and no criminal record (paragraph 9 of the judgment and document Cour (93) 290, Annexes A-B, pp.100 B-C, 116 B-C), required a higher level of suspicion and the application to the respondent Government of a stricter standard when justifying before this Court the \"reasonableness\" of the suspicion. Needless to say that the domestic courts examined the issue from the standpoint of section 14 of the 1978 Act, which required an honest and genuine, rather than a reasonable, suspicion. The scope of their examination was confined to that.\r\n6.  Regarding the alleged violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) of the Convention, in our view the evidence as to Mrs Murray’s questioning at the military screening centre (paragraphs 16 to 27 of the judgment), the vague indications and the questions put to her lack the necessary precision to justify a conclusion that she was informed of the reasons for her arrest. From the recorded questions about her brothers or \"about money and about America\", it is not possible for us to conclude that it was apparent to her \"that she was questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA\".\r\n7.  In the Fox, Campbell and Hartley judgment (paragraph 40) the Court declared that \"[p]aragraph 2 of Article 5 (art. 5-2) contains the elementary safeguard that any person arrested should know why he is being deprived of his liberty. This provision is an integral part of the scheme of protection afforded by Article 5 (art. 5): by virtue of paragraph 2 (art. 5-2) any person arrested must be told, in simple, non-technical language that he can understand, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest, so as to be able, if he sees fit, to apply to a court to challenge its lawfulness in accordance with paragraph 4 (art. 5-4)\".\r\nIn our opinion, bearing in mind the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the questions put to Mrs Murray in the course of her interrogation (paragraphs 14 and 21 of the judgment), the information given to Mrs Murray did not meet this basic standard.\r\n8.  As to Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5) of the Convention, since Mrs Murray’s arrest and detention were in breach of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article (art. 5-1, art. 5-2), she was entitled to an enforceable right to compensation in accordance with this provision. We would recall, as did the Commission (report, paragraph 75), that in the similar case of Fox, Campbell and Hartley (paragraph 46) the Court found a violation of Article 5 para. 5 (art. 5-5).\r\n9.  The alleged violation of Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention is directly linked with the issues under Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) of the Convention. Consequently, our conclusion is that, a breach of this provision having been found to have occurred in the circumstances of the case, the above-mentioned measures taken by the Army interfering in Mrs Murray’s private life cannot, in the absence of an objective justification of the suspicions of Mrs Murray’s terrorist activity, be regarded as necessary in a democratic society for the prevention of crime in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 (art. 8-2). We therefore also find a violation of this provision of the Convention.\r\n \r\n \r\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MIFSUD BONNICI\r\n1.  I am in agreement with the majority on most of the points at issue in this case, starting with the finding that the arrest of the first applicant was carried out on a reasonable suspicion that she had committed an offence; thereby holding that Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) was not violated.\r\n2.  I dissent, however, on the second point; that of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2), which guarantees to \"everyone who is arrested\" the right to be \"informed promptly, in a language which he understands, of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him\".\r\nThe essential and relevant facts, as accepted in the judgment are that:\r\n(a) When Corporal D. proceeded to the first applicant’s house, she said to her, \"As a member of Her Majesty’s forces, I arrest you.\" And on being asked twice by the first applicant under what section, Corporal D. replied, \"Section 14\" (paragraph 12 of the judgment).\r\n(b) Corporal D. told the domestic court that \"the purpose of arrest and detention under section 14 was not to gather intelligence but to question a suspected person about an offence\" (paragraph 20 of the judgment). This was confirmed by Sergeant B. (paragraph 22).\r\n3.  Now there is absolutely nothing in the whole proceedings to indicate that after the first applicant was arrested on the strength of section 14, she was thereafter promptly given the reasons for her arrest and/or informed of any offence with which she was charged.\r\nIn the concrete circumstances of the case, I am prepared to allow that promptness can be waived because of the short duration of the detention, but once the first applicant was arrested (and not merely asked to go voluntarily to a place designated for interrogation) she was entitled to be told why she was being arrested - which in effect means \"that she was suspected of having committed a given offence\". Once that is done, the further information that she was being charged with a given offence can, within a reasonable time, follow. This, however, must be preceded by the first phase, wherein the arrested person must be informed of the reasons for the arrest. This phase cannot be skipped, ignored or disregarded, especially when, as in this case, the person arrested is not charged with an offence.\r\n4.  In the view of the majority (paragraph 77 of the judgment) this guarantee was satisfied because\r\n\"it must have been apparent to Mrs Murray that she was being questioned about her possible involvement in the collection of funds for the purchase of arms for the Provisional IRA by her brothers in the USA\",\r\nwhich induces the Court to come to the conclusion that\r\n\"the reasons for her arrest were sufficiently brought to her attention during her interview\".\r\nAnd therefore there was no violation.\r\n5.  In my opinion this decision reduces the meaning of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) to such a low level that it is doubtful whether in fact it can, if it is adhered to in this form, have any possible concrete application in the future.\r\nIn fact what is being held here is that through the contents of an interrogation an accused person can, by inference or deduction, arrive, on his own, to understand \"the reasons for his arrest and ... any charge against him\". Since the Convention obliges the investigating officer \"to inform\" the arrested person, I cannot agree that the duty imposed on the investigating officer can be satisfied by the obligation of the arrested person to carry out a logical exercise so that he will thereby know of the charge against him - surmising both, from the contents of the interrogation.\r\n6.  It is not really possible to sustain this interpretation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2). If it is sustained, then it would mean that the guarantee therein contemplated will only come into play in situations such as that which is described in Franz Kafka’s masterpiece The Trial, where the Inspector, who is supposed to interrogate K (the accused person), tells K ,\r\n\"I can’t even confirm that you are charged with an offence, or rather I don’t know whether you are. You are under arrest certainly, more than that I do not know.\" \r\n7.  Therefore, the interpretation arrived at is a substantial limitation of the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2), to which I cannot subscribe, and I find that there was a violation of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2).\r\n8.  On all the other points in this judgment, I form part of the majority.\r\n\r\nEnglish translation by W. and E. Muir from the German original Der Prozess – Penguin reprint 1953, p. 18.\r\n\r\n \r\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE JAMBREK\r\nI subscribe to the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Loizou, Morenilla and Makarczyk as regards the violation of Article 5 paras. 1, 2 and 5 (art. 5-1, art. 5-2, art. 5-5).\r\nI also wish to make some additional points, which reflect my own reasoning related to the case.\r\n1.  In the examination of the matter of \"reasonable suspicion\", the key issue seems to me to be whether \"at least some facts or information\" were furnished by the Government, which would satisfy an objective observer that the person concerned may have committed the offence. In my opinion this condition of reasonableness was not fulfilled. It was suggested by the representative of the Government that \"primary facts\", obtained from a reliable confidential source, which cannot be disclosed must be differentiated from \"something other than the primary facts or information\". Elements of the latter kind, he claimed, had been provided which should be capable of so satisfying an objective observer. He cited:\r\n(a)  the honest belief of the arresting officer,\r\n(b)  the briefing by a superior officer, and\r\n(c)  circumstances preventing disclosure of information.\r\nIn my view all three are capable of satisfying the condition of an honest or genuine suspicion, but do not constitute \"at least some facts or information\" on which a reasonable suspicion could be based. Neither honesty of an arresting officer, nor honesty of superior officer, nor the circumstances of a suspected terrorist crime fall into this category.\r\nAt the hearing the Government’s representative also identified three other kinds of more specific \"objective evidence\", namely the conviction of the first applicant’s brothers, her contacts with them and her visits to America. The problem with these facts, as I see it, is that none of them per se may be held against the first applicant to incriminate her. They rather resemble the incrimination of a person’s status, in this case the first applicant’s kinship relationship.\r\nI am therefore led to conclude that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) in respect of the first applicant, following the reasoning in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley v. the United Kingdom judgment (judgment of 30 August 1990, Series A no. 182).\r\n2.  Was it possible for the Court to set some modified standards for \"reasonable suspicion\" in the context of emergency laws enacted to combat terrorist crime?\r\nAt this point I wish to explain some of my \"philosophic prejudices\" related to this issue. Much was made in the Government’s memorial of the specific features of terrorist crime and the relevant emergency provisions, allowing for the tipping of the balance between State and individual interests in the direction of the raison d’Etat. However, the existence of an emergency may be used to argue in favour of both interests involved, namely that of the Government and that of the arrested person. For example, under emergency laws, individual rights may be abused even more easily and on a larger scale than in normal times. They should therefore be given an even more careful protection in view of the intensity of national interests in taking repressive measures against crime. Suspects should thus not be denied being provided with at least some evidence and grounds for their arrest, in order to be able to challenge the allegations against them. Neither should the competent domestic court be left without persuasive evidence supporting the required reasonableness of the arrest.\r\nI also do not dispute that by and large intelligence-gathering organisations do indeed obtain \"reliable\" items of information which have to be kept confidential, and which should be trusted without closer examination.\r\nBut are the items obtained all and always relevant? We may assume that at least some of them are irrelevant or already notorious. Information on persons’ travel abroad or on their kinship relationships, for example, may be very reliable and also happen to be classified as secret, but it may be irrelevant or already notorious. Therefore I would hesitate to make life for the intelligence-gathering services too easy, at the expense of detainees and especially at the expense of the domestic courts.\r\n3.  My underlying philosophic approach having been identified, some more \"technical\" points about the case may be made.\r\nThe search for a balance between the State’s interest in fighting crime and the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights is the obvious task of the Strasbourg Court. To this end I would propose clarifying the following preliminary issues:\r\nFirst, what is the relationship between the Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) requirement of \"reasonable suspicion\" and the Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) right to be \"informed promptly of the reasons for his arrest and of any charge against him\"?\r\nAre grounds for reasonable suspicion identical to reasons for arrest?\r\nA usual consequence of the implementation of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (art. 5-1-c) is that the national courts will, if need be, be called on to decide whether the arresting officer entertained reasonable suspicion of an offence committed by the detainee, while the purpose of Article 5 para. 2 (art. 5-2) is to enable the arrested person to assess the lawfulness of the arrest and take steps to challenge it, if need be. This difference may justify differential treatment of evidence supporting such reasons in terms of their confidentiality.\r\nA further point is that the Court referred in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley case to \"information which ... cannot ... be revealed to the suspect or produced in court to support the charge\".\r\nTwo questions seem to me relevant in this respect. First, is there a difference between revealing information to the suspect and then producing it in court? Probably not. And secondly, is there a difference between information made available to the court and information produced in a court, that is revealed to the suspect?\r\nIn this connection I see some scope for compromise between the wish to preserve the Fox, Campbell and Hartley standard and, at the same time, the need to expand and elaborate its reasoning in order to adapt it better to the Murray case and other similar cases.\r\nThe \"technical\" question could also be posed whether otherwise confidential information could not be rephrased, reshaped or tailored in order to protect its source and then be revealed. In this respect the domestic court could seek an alternative, independent expert opinion, without relying solely on the assertions of the arresting authority.\r\n4.  I voted for non-violation of Article 8 (art. 8) because I do not see a necessary link between the breach of the requirements of Article 5 para. 1 (art. 5-1) and the interference in the private and family life of Mrs Murray (and her family). I am satisfied with the approach of the Court in regard to Article 8 (art. 8), and, in particular, with its conclusion that the interference was in accordance with the law and that the contested measures pursued a legitimate aim and were necessary in a democratic society (paragraphs 88 to 94 of the judgment).\r\nHowever, in the light of my views as to the violation of various provisions of Article 5 (art. 5), I cannot subscribe to the Court’s reasoning in paragraph 92 of the judgment, namely that Mrs Murray was reasonably suspected of the commission of a terrorist-linked crime and that this fact justified the need to enter and search her home. The finding of non-violation of Article 8 (art. 8) can be sufficiently well grounded regardless of the reasoning in paragraph 92 of the Court’s judgment.\r\n\r\n",

AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n(Application no. 16841/90)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n23 October 1995 \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the case of Pfarrmeier v. Austria  ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A  , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President,\r\n\tMr \tF. MATSCHER, \r\n\tMr \tL.-E. PETTITI, \r\n\tMr \tR. MACDONALD, \r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS, \r\n\tMr \tI. FOIGHEL, \r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA, \r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND, \r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK,  \r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar,  \r\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 April and 28 September 1995,  \r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: \r\nPROCEDURE  \r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 9 September 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 16841/90) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by an Austrian national, Mr Harald Pfarrmeier, on 13 June 1990.\r\n\r\nThe case is numbered 37/1994/484/566.  The first number is the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court in the relevant year (second number).  The last two numbers indicate the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court since its creation and on the list of the corresponding originating applications to the Commission.  \r\n  Rules A apply to all cases referred to the Court before the entry into force of Protocol No. 9 (P9) and thereafter only to cases concerning States not bound by that Protocol (P9).  They correspond to the Rules that came into force on 1 January 1983, as amended several times subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.  \r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).  \r\n3.   On 24 September 1994 the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider the instant case and the cases of Schmautzer, Umlauft, Gradinger, Pramstaller and Palaoro v. Austria  . \r\nThe Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Mr F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L. E. Pettiti, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Sir John Freeland and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).  \r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Austrian Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's memorial on 23 January 1995 and the applicant's memorial on 30 January 1995.  On 3 February the Commission supplied the Registrar with various documents that he had requested on the President's instructions.  \r\n5.   In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 April 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:  \r\n(a) for the Government  \r\n\t\tMr F. CEDE, Ambassador, Head of the International\r\n\t\t\tLaw Department, Federal Ministry of\r\n\t\t\tForeign Affairs,\tAgent,\r\n\t\tMs I. SIEß, Constitutional Department,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Chancellery, \r\n\t\tMs E. BERTAGNOLI, International Law Department,\r\n\t\t\tFederal Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission  \r\n\t\tMr A. WEITZEL,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant  \r\n\t\tMr W.L. WEH, Rechtsanwalt,\tCounsel.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Weitzel, Mr Weh and Mr Cede. \r\n\r\n  Cases nos. 31/1994/478/560, 32/1994/479/561, 33/1994/480/562, 35/1994/482/564 and 36/1994/483/565.\r\n \r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE  \r\n6.   On 5 April 1986 Mr Harald Pfarrmeier was stopped by the police after he had parked his car at the side of the road with its headlights on and the engine running.  He refused to submit to a breath test.  In a \"sentence order\" (Straferkenntnis) of the same day the Bregenz district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) imposed on him a fine of 9,000 Austrian schillings (ATS) with 360 hours' imprisonment in default of payment, for an offence under section 99(1)(b) taken together with section 5(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsordnung - see paragraphs 13 and 14 below).  \r\n7.   The applicant appealed against that decision to the Vorarlberg regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), which dismissed the appeal on 11 November 1987.  \r\n8.   On 7 January 1988 Mr Pfarrmeier applied to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof).  He complained, in particular, that the impugned decision was unlawful and that there had been a procedural irregularity.\r\nOn 23 March 1988 the Administrative Court quashed the decision of the regional government (section 42(2), sub-paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz) - see paragraph 21 below) and referred the case back to it.  \r\n9.   The Vorarlberg regional government, giving a second ruling on 23 December 1988, upheld the Bregenz district authority's decision on the issue of guilt, but reduced the fine to ATS 5,000 and the penalty in default to 200 hours' imprisonment.  \r\n10.   On 10 February 1989 the applicant applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof).  He complained of an infringement of the right of property, of the principle that all citizens are equal before the law and of the right to a \"fair procedure\" in criminal proceedings under Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention.\r\nOn 10 March 1989, at the conclusion of a consideration of the case in private, the Constitutional Court declined to accept the appeal for adjudication (Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) - see paragraph 17 below), since, in view of Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention, it did not have sufficient prospects of success; moreover, the case did not lie outside the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.  \r\n11.   At Mr Pfarrmeier's request, it referred the application to the Administrative Court on 24 April 1989.  \r\n12.   Reiterating in substance the arguments he had set out before the Constitutional Court, the applicant complained, in particular, of a faulty assessment of the evidence by the administrative authority concerned.\r\nThe Administrative Court ruled for the second time and dismissed the appeal, after proceedings that were wholly in writing; the applicant had not asked it to hold a hearing.  It gave the following reasons:\r\n\"However, having regard to the Administrative Court's limited supervisory power in proceedings relating to an application for review of an administrative decision, it is not for the court to ascertain whether the assessment made of the evidence in a given case is correct in the sense, for example, that a statement which incriminates the applicant corresponds to the facts and not the reply (decision of 3 October 1985 delivered by a full court, Zl. 85/02/0053).  \r\nAccordingly, the applicant's complaint that he did not speak to the reporting police officer about a night's drinking session cannot be entertained.  \r\n...  \r\nThe respondent authority was entitled, without disregarding the requirement that the assessment of the evidence has to be conclusive, to draw from the established facts mentioned above the conclusion that objective circumstances - and not merely the subjective belief of the reporting police officer - supported the suspicion that the applicant was under the influence of drink.  \r\n...  \r\nAs regards the applicant's complaint that his lawyer was not allowed to examine the witness Widlroither in the proceedings before the authority, reference is made to the Administrative Court's settled case-law, according to which neither the holding of a hearing nor the possibility of examining witnesses is an essential part of lawful administrative criminal proceedings (see the decision of 13 June 1986, Zl. 86/18/0065, and the one of 19 February 1987, Zl. 86/02/0159).  \r\nAs to the alleged unconstitutionality of Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the European Convention on Human Rights, reference is made to the decision delivered by a full court on 8 May 1987, Slg NF no. 12.466/A.  \r\nSince the alleged unlawfulness of the impugned decision has not been made out in the application, it falls to be dismissed as unfounded, under section 42(1) of the Administrative Court Act.  \r\n...\"  \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW  \r\nA. Road traffic legislation  \r\n13.   Under section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 it is an offence for any person to drive a vehicle if the proportion of alcohol in his blood or breath is equal to or higher than 0.8 grams per litre or 0.4 milligrams per litre respectively.  The same section also lays down the conditions for the use of breathalysers and blood tests.  \r\n14.   In its 1971 version, section 99(1) of the Act provided:  \r\n\"It shall be an administrative offence (Verwaltungsübertretung), punishable with a fine of not less than 5,000 and not more than 30,000 schillings or, in default of payment, with one to six weeks' imprisonment, for any person \r\n ...  \r\n(b) to refuse to submit to a breath test where the conditions laid down in section 5 are satisfied;  \r\n...\"  \r\n15.   In 1958, at the time when the Austrian Government ratified the Convention (see paragraph 25 below), section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (Straßenpolizeigesetz) provided: \"Every driver shall be under a duty to pay reasonable heed to other road users and to display the care and diligence necessary to ensure the maintenance of order, safety and a proper flow of traffic.\"  \r\nB. Procedure  \r\n16.   Article 90 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) provides:  \r\n\"Hearings by trial courts in civil and criminal cases shall be oral and public.  Exceptions may be prescribed by law.\"  \r\n1. Proceedings in the Constitutional Court  \r\n17.   By Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Constitutional Court, when an application (Beschwerde) is made to it, has to determine whether an administrative decision (Bescheid) has infringed a right guaranteed by the Constitution or has applied regulations (Verordnung) contrary to the law, a law contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law.\r\nArticle 144 para. 2 provides:  \r\n\"Up to the time of the hearing the Constitutional Court may by means of a decision (Beschluß) decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it cannot be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law.  The court may not decline to accept for adjudication a case excluded from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court by Article 133.\"  \r\n2. Proceedings in the Administrative Court  \r\n18.   By Article 130 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear, inter alia, applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful.  \r\n19.   Section 39(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides, in particular, that at the end of the preliminary proceedings (Vorverfahren) the Administrative Court must hold a hearing where the applicant makes a request to that effect.  \r\nSection 39(2) reads as follows:  \r\n\"Notwithstanding a party's application under subsection (1), the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing where  \r\n1.   the proceedings must be stayed (section 33) or the application dismissed (section 34);  \r\n2.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction (section 42(2)(2));  \r\n3.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful on account of a breach of procedural rules (section 42(2)(3));  \r\n4.   the impugned decision must be quashed because its content is unlawful according to the established case-law of the Administrative Court;  \r\n5.   neither the respondent authority nor any other party before the court has filed pleadings in reply and the impugned decision is to be quashed;  \r\n6.   it is apparent to the court from the pleadings of the parties to the proceedings before it and from the files relating to the earlier administrative proceedings that a hearing is not likely to clarify the case further.\"  \r\nSub-paragraphs 1 to 3 of section 39(2) were in force in 1958; sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 were inserted in 1964 and sub-paragraph 6 in 1982.  \r\n20.   Section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides:  \r\n\"In so far as the Administrative Court does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority's lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules (section 42(2)(2) and (3)) ..., it must examine the impugned decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward ... \r\nIf it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on [one of these complaints] ..., it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary.\"  \r\n21.   Section 42(1) of the same Act states that, save as otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision.  \r\nBy section 42(2),  \r\n\"The Administrative Court shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful  \r\n1.   by reason of its content, [or]  \r\n2.   because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction, [or]  \r\n3.   on account of a breach of procedural rules, in that  \r\n(a) the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are, in an important respect, contradicted by the case file, or  \r\n(b) the facts require further investigation on an important point, or  \r\n(c) procedural rules have been disregarded, compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority.\"  \r\n22.   If the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision, \"the administrative authorities [are] under a duty ... to take immediate steps, using the legal means available to them, to bring about in the specific case the legal situation which corresponds to the Administrative Court's view of the law (Rechtsanschauung)\" (section 63(1)).  \r\n23.   In a judgment of 14 October 1987 (G 181/86) the Constitutional Court held:  \r\n\"From the fact that it has been necessary to extend the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention to cover the procedural safeguards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, because of the connection between those two provisions (art. 5, art. 6), it follows that, conversely, the limited review (die (bloß) nachprüfende Kontrolle) carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court is insufficient in respect of criminal penalties within the meaning of the Convention that are not covered by the reservation.\"  \r\n3. The \"independent administrative tribunals\"  \r\n24.   Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution, administrative courts called \"independent administrative tribunals\" (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate) were set up in the Länder with effect from 1 January 1991.  The functions of these tribunals include determining both the factual and the legal issues arising in cases concerning administrative offences (Verwaltungsübertretungen).  \r\nIII.   AUSTRIA'S RESERVATION IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE 5 (ART. 5) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n25.   The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by the Austrian Government on 3 September 1958 contains, inter alia, a reservation worded as follows:  \r\n\"The provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention shall be so applied that there shall be no interference with the measures for the deprivation of liberty prescribed in the laws on administrative procedure, BGBl [Federal Official Gazette] No. 172/1950, subject to review by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Austrian Federal Constitution.\"  \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION  \r\n26.   Mr Pfarrmeier applied to the Commission on 13 June 1990.  Relying on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, he complained that he had not had access to a court with full jurisdiction and had not been able to examine witnesses.  \r\n27.   On 10 May 1993 the Commission declared the application (no. 16841/90) admissible.\r\nIn its report of 19 May 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion that there had been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) as regards access to a court (unanimously) and that no separate issue arose under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) as to the failure to hold a hearing (unanimously) or under Article 6 para. 3 (d) (art. 6-3-d) as to the impossibility of examining witnesses.  The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the concurring opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment  . \r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT  \r\n28.   In their memorial the Government asked the Court to hold that  \r\n\"Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention is not applicable in the present case; or alternatively, that Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention was not violated in the administrative criminal proceedings underlying the application\".  \r\n\r\n  Note by the Registrar: for practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printed version of the judgment (volume 329-C of Series A of the Publications of the Court), but a copy of the Commission's report is obtainable from the registry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS TO THE LAW  \r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n29.   The applicant complained of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ...\"  \r\nHe had, he maintained, been denied the right to a \"tribunal\" and to a hearing before such a body.  \r\nA. Applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n1. Whether there was a \"criminal charge\"  \r\n30.   In Mr Pfarrmeier's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a \"criminal charge\".  This was not disputed by the Government.  \r\n31.   In order to determine whether an offence qualifies as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention, it is first necessary to ascertain whether or not the provision (art. 6-1) defining the offence belongs, in the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next the \"very nature of the offence\" and the degree of severity of the penalty risked must be considered (see, among other authorities, the Öztürk v. Germany judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, p. 18, para. 50, and the Demicoli v. Malta judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, pp. 15-17, paras. 31-34).  \r\n32.   Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.  This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).  In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 14 above).\r\nThese considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that Article 6 (art. 6) applies.\r\n2. Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention  \r\n33.   According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.  There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to \"measures for the deprivation of liberty\" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures. Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison.\r\nAdmittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.  However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.  It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 15 above).  \r\n34.   The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.  In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"1.  Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision.  Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  \r\n2.  Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.\"  \r\nSecondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  \r\n35.   The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).  It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.  They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.\r\nThe Court notes that Mr Pfarrmeier based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.  Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.  Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied.\r\nThese considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.  \r\nB. Compliance with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n1. Access to a tribunal  \r\n36.   Mr Pfarrmeier contended that none of the bodies that had dealt with his case in the proceedings in issue could be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.  The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 21 above).  It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.  Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.  In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  \r\n37.   The Government contested this view, whereas the Commission accepted it.  \r\n38.   The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  \r\n39.   The Constitutional Court is not such a body.  In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts.  It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  \r\n40.   The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\".  These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.  As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of the Convention.  Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review conducted by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 23 above).  \r\n41.   It follows that the applicant did not have access to a \"tribunal\".  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point.\r\n2. Lack of a hearing and failure to take evidence from witnesses  \r\n42.   Mr Pfarrmeier further criticised the Administrative Court for failing to hold a hearing or take evidence from witnesses.  \r\n43.   Having regard to the conclusion in paragraph 41 above, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine these complaints.  \r\nII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n44.   Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,  \r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"  \r\n45.   The Delegate of the Commission left the matter of just satisfaction to the discretion of the Court.  \r\nA. Damage  \r\n46.   In respect of pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed repayment of the fine imposed on him, that is to say ATS 5,500.  He also claimed ATS 5,000 for non-pecuniary damage.  \r\n47.   The Government contended that the Court had no jurisdiction to quash convictions pronounced by national courts or to order repayment of fines.  Moreover, it could not, in awarding reparation, speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if the applicant had had access to a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.  \r\n48.   The Court agrees.  It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47).  It considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the present judgment affords the applicant sufficient reparation. \r\nB. Costs and expenses  \r\n49.   In addition, Mr Pfarrmeier claimed the sum of ATS 217,628 for the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings first in the domestic courts and then before the Convention institutions.  \r\n50.   The Government expressed the view that only the proceedings in the Administrative Court - which had given rise to the alleged violations - and those in Strasbourg could be taken into account.  They also contested the quantum of the costs, but they were prepared to reimburse a total of ATS 300,000 in respect of the Umlauft, Pramstaller, Palaoro and Pfarrmeier cases, the applicants in all these cases having been represented by the same lawyer.  \r\n51.   Making an assessment on an equitable basis, having regard to the information in its possession and its case-law, the Court awards Mr Pfarrmeier ATS 100,000.  \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY  \r\n1.   Holds that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention applies in this case;  \r\n\r\n2.   Holds that there has been a violation of that Article (art. 6-1) as regards access to a court;  \r\n\r\n3.   Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaints based on the lack of a hearing in the Administrative Court and that court's failure to take evidence from witnesses;  \r\n4.   Holds that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, 100,000 (one hundred thousand) Austrian schillings in respect of costs and expenses;  \r\n\r\n5.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.  \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 October 1995.  \r\n\r\n\t\tRolv RYSSDAL\r\n\t\tPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD \r\nRegistrar \r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the separate opinion of Mr Martens is annexed to this judgment.  \r\n\r\nR. R. \r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS  \r\n1.   I concur in the Court's finding that Article 6 (art. 6) has been violated, but cannot agree with its reasoning.  \r\n2.   My objections concern paragraph 40 of the judgment, which starts with the statement:  \r\n\"The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.\"  \r\n3.   I will refrain from a structural criticism of this paragraph. I cannot help noting, however, that here again the Court finds it necessary to remark that when it is being assessed whether or not the Administrative Court is to be considered a court that affords the safeguards of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), \"regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court\".  One looks in vain, however, for evidence of this methodological principle being put into practice: there does not follow any analysis of what the applicant argued before the Administrative Court, nor is there any trace of \"regard\" to these arguments in the assessment of the adequacy of the Administrative Court's jurisdiction.  For the rest, I refer to the methodological objections to this \"test\" that I raised in paragraph 18 of my separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria (judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312).  \r\n4.   My main objection to this paragraph is the following.  In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.  One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"criminal\" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"civil\" one.  I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  .  Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument.  This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . \r\n\r\n\r\n I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria. _ \r\n See, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53; the Albert and Le Compte v.

Austria  ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A  , as a Chamber composed of the following judges: \r\n\tMr \tR. RYSSDAL, President, \r\n\tMr \tF. MATSCHER,\r\n\tMr \tL.-E. PETTITI, \r\n\tMr \tR. MACDONALD,\r\n\tMr \tS.K. MARTENS,\r\n\tMr \tI. FOIGHEL,\r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\tSir \tJohn FREELAND, \r\n\tMr \tJ. MAKARCZYK,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, \r\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 April and 28 September 1995, \r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date: \r\nPROCEDURE \r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 9 September 1994, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention.  It originated in an application (no. 16713/90) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by an Austrian national, Mr Johann Pramstaller, on 18 May 1990.\r\nThe Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).  The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.  \r\n\r\n  The case is numbered 35/1994/482/564.  The first number is the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court in the relevant year (second number).  The last two numbers indicate the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court since its creation and on the list of the corresponding originating applications to the Commission.  \r\n  Rules A apply to all cases referred to the Court before the entry into force of Protocol No. 9 (P9) and thereafter only to cases concerning States not bound by that Protocol (P9).  They correspond to the Rules that came into force on 1 January 1983, as amended several times subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).  \r\n3.   On 24 September 1994, the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to consider the instant case and the cases of Schmautzer, Umlauft, Gradinger, Palaoro and Pfarrmeier v. Austria  . \r\n4.   The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Mr F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).  On the same day, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L. E. Pettiti, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Sir John Freeland and Mr J. Makarczyk (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43).  \r\n5.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Austrian Government (\"the Government\"), the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government's memorial on 24 January 1995 and the applicant's memorial on 30 January 1995.  \r\n6.   On 3 February 1995 the Commission produced various documents in the proceedings before it, as requested by the Registrar on the President's instructions. \r\n7.   In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 26 April 1995.  The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government  \r\n\t\tMr F. CEDE, Ambassador, Head of the International \r\n\t\t\tLaw Department, Federal Ministry of \r\n\t\t\tForeign Affairs,\tAgent, \r\n\t\tMs I. SIEß, Constitutional Department, \r\n\t\t\tFederal Chancellery, \r\n\t\tMs E. BERTAGNOLI, International Law Department, \r\n\t\t\tFederal Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission  \r\n\t\tMr A. WEITZEL,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant  \r\n\t\tMr W.L. WEH, Rechtsanwalt,\tCounsel.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Weitzel, Mr Weh and Mr Cede.\r\n\r\n  Cases nos. 31/1994/478/560, 32/1994/479/561, 33/1994/480/562, 36/1994/483/565 and 37/1994/484/566\r\n\r\n  \r\nAS TO THE FACTS  \r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE  \r\n8.   Mr Johann Pramstaller lives at Debant, near Lienz.  \r\n9.   On 17 March 1987 Nußdorf-Debant municipal council granted Mr Pramstaller planning permission for the construction of new commercial premises, subject to various detailed conditions: two groceries should be built, each with appropriate commercial and sanitary amenities and separate entrances; and a dividing wall was to be erected between the two shops.\r\nAt a later stage the applicant informed the council that he was envisaging opening a supermarket on the premises, whereupon the council drew his attention to the specifications in the planning permission, which allowed only for two different smaller shops to be built, with separate entrances and divided by a party wall.  They further warned the applicant that failure to comply with these specifications would result in the works being immediately halted.  \r\n10.   On 23 July 1987 the council ordered the applicant to suspend the works.  An inspection of the site had shown that, contrary to the terms of the planning permission, only one larger shop was being built instead of the two smaller ones.  The applicant had thus disregarded several conditions of the planning permission.  \r\n11.   On 10 November 1987 the Lienz district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) served a \"sentence order\" (Straferkenntnis) on the applicant pursuant to sections 53(1)(a) and 53(2) of the Tyrol Building Regulations Act (Tiroler Bauordnung - see paragraph 15 below). According to the order, it had been established that the applicant had not only failed to erect the party wall as well as certain amenities, but had also opened an additional entrance, considerably enlarged the premises, built an additional wall and created one large shop instead of the two smaller ones originally planned.  In so doing, the applicant had carried out works without planning permission.\r\nMr Pramstaller was ordered to pay a fine of 50,000 Austrian schillings (ATS) with fifty days' imprisonment in default of payment, plus costs.  An appeal by him to the Tyrol regional government (Amt der Landesregierung) was dismissed on 22 March 1988 on the ground, among others, that the works carried out by the applicant not only failed to comply with the permission granted but were in part illegal.  \r\n12.   Mr Pramstaller then applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof), alleging, inter alia, a violation of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention in that he had not been able to bring his case, or have an oral hearing held, before a tribunal which conformed with that provision (art. 6).  On 16 September 1988 the Constitutional Court declined to accept the case for adjudication under Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes- Verfassungsgesetz - see paragraph 18 below) as raising questions concerning the application of ordinary law (einfaches Gesetz); in so far as the complaint did raise issues of constitutional law, the Constitutional Court found that the application did not have sufficient prospects of success.  \r\n13.   The applicant then requested to have his case transferred to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof), with which grounds of appeal against the administrative authorities' decision were subsequently lodged.  \r\n14.   On 14 September 1989 the applicant's appeal was dismissed by the Administrative Court pursuant to section 42(1) of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz - see paragraph 22 below). With regard to the complaints concerning Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, the court pointed out that the Administrative Criminal Justice Act (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz) did not confer a general right to a hearing before the administrative authorities.  Only in special circumstances was a hearing to be held.  \r\nThe Administrative Court then dealt with the remaining complaints as follows:  \r\n\"The applicant further submitted that the impugned decision dealt only with the obligation, noted in the decision at first instance, to obtain permission not to erect the dividing wall, and not with the obligation to obtain permission for the other - in his view minimal - failures to comply with the plan.  But as, he maintained, the question whether these other failures to comply with the plan might lead to the applicant's being punished was of importance if the failure to erect the wall was not punishable, the reasoning was inadequate.  This submission is inaccurate, because the respondent authority did in fact, as it was entitled to do, take it for granted that planning permission was necessary for all the measures mentioned in the original decision.  The major building works undertaken by the applicant were, as the file shows, not covered by permission from the planning authorities.  There was also clearly a consistent intention to go ahead and build in disregard of the planning regulations.  The applicant further overlooks that, quite apart from the principle that planning permission was necessary for such a building project, permission could never have been given for a shopping centre such as was built in the instant case, having regard to the provision in section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act, which was declared constitutional by the Constitutional Court in a decision (B 816/86) of 2 March 1988.  \r\nDuring the planning-application proceedings Mr Pramstaller acted as the applicant for planning permission and as the owner of the land and the building on it.  The [Z.] firm put itself forward as the future user of the building.  The applicant never disputed during the administrative criminal proceedings that he was the person for whom the building was being constructed and that he was thus liable in administrative criminal law.  His submission that the dividing wall was not built not on his orders but on those of the [Z.] firm that was using the commercial premises can therefore not exonerate him as he bore the responsibility for accepting and carrying out the orders of the future occupier. The suggestion set out for the first time in the statement of facts in the supplementary application that the building was being constructed for another firm is a new submission that is inadmissible in administrative proceedings by virtue of section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act.  \r\nIt was further submitted that the suspension of the building works that had been ordered had made it impossible to erect the dividing wall, although this could have been done without substantial expenditure even after the building work had stopped, so that there had been no negligence.  \r\nThis submission likewise cannot assist the applicant.  As the evidence and the applicant's submission clearly show, there had been no intention to build the dividing wall even before building work was suspended; on the contrary, the applicant deliberately refrained from doing so in order to secure a review of section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act by the Constitutional Court.  Furthermore, at the time when the building works were suspended, there were other important failures to comply with the planning permission for which approval would have been needed (see in the statement of facts the details of the findings made by the authority on 6 July 1987 during an inspection of the works).  The subsequent suspension of building work is accordingly of no legal significance in the present context.  \r\nThe respondent authority also rightly noted that the very fact of the repeatedly expressed intention not to erect the dividing wall and to maintain the building in issue in a state that did not comply with the planning permission and for which no approval had been given showed that there had been culpable intent. Similarly, as the respondent authority rightly recognised, the theoretical possibility that the Constitutional Court might declare section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act unconstitutional cannot be prayed in aid as a mitigating circumstance.  Contrary to the applicant's submissions, this purpose could have been achieved other than through failing to comply with the planning permission by not erecting the dividing wall and carrying out unauthorised works.  It was open to the applicant at the outset to make an application for planning permission to build large-scale commercial premises, a shopping centre, and in this way challenge section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act in the Constitutional Court.  The submission on this point therefore fails.  \r\nAs to the submission that, contrary to what was stated in the impugned decision, the authority (municipal council) had agreed to the dividing wall not being built after a report had been made by a fire-safety expert, the applicant is referred to the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council and to the note for the file made by him on the day of the meeting, from which it is quite clear that there was disagreement between the participants over the question whether authorisation was needed not to build the dividing wall and that the applicant was expressly warned by the municipal council that under section 31 of the Tyrol Building Regulations Act read together with section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act, a building scheme that was altered in this way could not be authorised.  The applicant is mistaken in suggesting that the statement made by the legal representative of the [Z.] firm, who was also present at the meeting, constitutes a ground for excluding his guilt.  From the observations filed by counsel for the applicant on the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council it appears that the whole question of suspending the building works and the issue of the constitutionality of section 16(b) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act were discussed and the possibility of challenging that provision in the Constitutional Court envisaged.  The municipal council was allegedly made aware of this 'outcome of the negotiations'.  The applicant himself, however, states in his application that there was disagreement among those taking part in the discussions as to the question of the need for authorisation not to build the dividing wall, with the municipal council assuming that such authorisation was necessary whereas the representative of the [Z.] firm assumed it was sufficient merely to report the fact.  The applicant thus himself admits that, contrary to later statements in the application and in the observations on the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council, no agreement was reached between the municipal council and the applicant, so that the assumption that there was a ground here for excluding the applicant's guilt is invalid on this ground alone.  Nor can the Administrative Court find that the respondent authority committed any significant procedural irregularities in this respect in the reasons given for the impugned decision.  The submission on this point is accordingly unfounded.  \r\nThe respondent authority dealt at length and accurately with the grounds for the assessment of punishment and with the assessment of punishment in general, so that it cannot be criticised in this respect either.  \r\n...\"  \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE  \r\nA. Legislation on building  \r\n15.   Section 53(1)(a) of the Tyrol Building Regulations Act (Tiroler Landesbauordnung) 1978 provides:  \r\n\"It shall be an administrative offence (Verwaltungsübertretung)  \r\n(a) to carry out without planning permission a building project that requires planning permission ...\"  \r\nSection 53(2) provides:  \r\n\"The administrative offences set out in paragraph 1 shall be punishable with a fine not exceeding ATS 100,000 or with imprisonment for up to three months ...\"  \r\n16.   Section 25 of the same Act provides:  \r\n\"The authorities' permission is required in the following cases:  \r\n(a) new building, extensions and conversions; and  \r\n(b) alterations to buildings or parts of buildings in so far as they affect the building's structural soundness, its safety in the event of fire, its plumbing or its external aspect ...\"  \r\nB. Procedure  \r\n17.   Article 90 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) provides:  \r\n\"Hearings by trial courts in civil and criminal cases shall be oral and public.  Exceptions may be prescribed by law.\"  \r\n1. Proceedings in the Constitutional Court  \r\n18.   By Article 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Constitutional Court, when an application (Beschwerde) is made to it, has to determine whether an administrative decision (Bescheid) has infringed a right guaranteed by the Constitution or has applied regulations (Verordnung) contrary to the law, a law contrary to the Constitution or an international treaty incompatible with Austrian law.  \r\nArticle 144 para. 2 provides:  \r\n\"Up to the time of the hearing the Constitutional Court may by means of a decision (Beschluß) decline to accept a case for adjudication if it does not have sufficient prospects of success or if it cannot be expected that the judgment will clarify an issue of constitutional law.  The court may not decline to accept for adjudication a case excluded from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court by Article 133.\"  \r\n2. Proceedings in the Administrative Court  \r\n19.   By Article 130 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution, the Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear, inter alia, applications alleging that an administrative decision is unlawful.  \r\n20.   Section 39(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides that at the end of the preliminary proceedings (Vorverfahren) the Administrative Court must hold a hearing where the applicant makes a request to that effect.  \r\nSection 39(2) reads as follows:  \r\n\"Notwithstanding a party's application under subsection (1), the Administrative Court may decide not to hold a hearing where  \r\n1.   the proceedings must be stayed (section 33) or the application dismissed (section 34);  \r\n2.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction (section 42(2)(2));  \r\n3.   the impugned decision must be quashed as unlawful on account of a breach of procedural rules (section 42(2)(3));  \r\n4.   the impugned decision must be quashed because its content is unlawful according to the established case-law of the Administrative Court;  \r\n5.   neither the respondent authority nor any other party before the court has filed pleadings in reply and the impugned decision is to be quashed;  \r\n6.   it is apparent to the court from the pleadings of the parties to the proceedings before it and from the files relating to the earlier administrative proceedings that a hearing is not likely to clarify the case further.\"  \r\nSub-paragraphs 1 to 3 of section 39(2) were in force in 1958; sub-paragraphs 4 and 5 were inserted in 1964 and sub-paragraph 6 in 1982.  \r\n21.   Section 41(1) of the Administrative Court Act provides:  \r\n\"In so far as the Administrative Court does not find any unlawfulness deriving from the respondent authority's lack of jurisdiction or from breaches of procedural rules (section 42(2)(2) and (3)) ..., it must examine the impugned decision on the basis of the facts found by the respondent authority and with reference to the complaints put forward ... If it considers that reasons which have not yet been notified to one of the parties might be decisive for ruling on [one of these complaints] ..., it must hear the parties on this point and adjourn the proceedings if necessary.\"  \r\n22.   Section 42(1) of the same Act states that, save as otherwise provided, the Administrative Court must either dismiss an application as ill-founded or quash the impugned decision.  \r\nBy section 42(2):  \r\n\"The Administrative Court shall quash the impugned decision if it is unlawful  \r\n1.   by reason of its content, [or]  \r\n2.   because the respondent authority lacked jurisdiction, [or]  \r\n3.   on account of a breach of procedural rules, in that  \r\n(a) the respondent authority has made findings of fact which are, in an important respect, contradicted by the case file, or  \r\n(b) the facts require further investigation on an important point, or  \r\n(c) procedural rules have been disregarded, compliance with which could have led to a different decision by the respondent authority.\"  \r\n23.   If the Administrative Court quashes the impugned decision, \"the administrative authorities [are] under a duty ... to take immediate steps, using the legal means available to them, to bring about in the specific case the legal situation which corresponds to the Administrative Court's view of the law (Rechtsanschauung)\" (section 63(1)).  \r\n24.   In a judgment of 14 October 1987 (G 181/86) the Constitutional Court held:  \r\n\"From the fact that it has been necessary to extend the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention to cover the procedural safeguards of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, because of the connection between those two provisions (art. 5, art. 6), it follows that, conversely, the limited review (die (bloß) nachprüfende Kontrolle) carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court is insufficient in respect of criminal penalties within the meaning of the Convention that are not covered by the reservation.\"  \r\n3. The \"independent administrative tribunals\"  \r\n25.   Pursuant to Article 129 of the Federal Constitution, administrative courts called \"independent administrative tribunals\" (Unabhängige Verwaltungssenate) were set up in the Länder with effect from 1 January 1991.  The functions of these tribunals include determining both the factual and the legal issues arising in cases concerning administrative offences (Verwaltungsübertretungen).  \r\nIII.   AUSTRIA'S RESERVATION IN RESPECT OF ARTICLE 5 (ART. 5) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n26.   The instrument of ratification of the Convention deposited by the Austrian Government on 3 September 1958 contains, inter alia, a reservation worded as follows:  \r\n\"The provisions of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention shall be so applied that there shall be no interference with the measures for the deprivation of liberty prescribed in the laws on administrative procedure, BGBl [Federal Official Gazette] No. 172/1950, subject to review by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Austrian Federal Constitution.\"  \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION  \r\n27.   Mr Pramstaller applied to the Commission on 18 May 1990.  He relied on Article 6 paras. 1, 2 and 3 (art. 6-1, art. 6-2, art. 6-3) of the Convention, complaining (a) that he had been unable to bring his case before a tribunal for the determination of a criminal charge against him and (b) that he had not had a fair trial in that the burden of proof had been on him, the accused.  \r\n28.   On 10 May 1993 the Commission declared the application (no. 16713/90) admissible in so far as it concerned the complaint that the applicant had not been able to bring his case before a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.\r\nIn its report of 19 May 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of that provision (art. 6 1).  It further expressed the opinion that the lack of hearing in the Administrative Court raised no separate issue.  The full text of the Commission's opinion and of the concurring opinion contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment  . \r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT \r\n29.   In their memorial the Government asked the Court to hold that  \r\n\"Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention is not applicable in the present case; or alternatively, that Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention was not violated in the administrative criminal proceedings underlying the application\".  \r\n\r\n  Note by the Registrar: for practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printed version of the judgment (volume 329-A of Series A of the Publications of the Court), but a copy of the Commission's report is available from the registry.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS TO THE LAW  \r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 PARA. 1 (art. 6-1) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n30.   The applicant complained of a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention, which provides:  \r\n\"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal ...\"  \r\nHe had, he maintained, been denied the right to a \"tribunal\" and to a hearing before such a body.  \r\nA. Applicability of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n1. Whether there was a \"criminal charge\"  \r\n31.   In Mr Pramstaller's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a \"criminal charge\".  This was not disputed by the Government.  \r\n32.   In order to determine whether an offence qualifies as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention, it is first necessary to ascertain whether or not the provision (art. 6-1) defining the offence belongs, in the legal system of the respondent State, to criminal law; next the \"very nature of the offence\" and the degree of severity of the penalty risked must be considered (see, among other authorities, the Öztürk v. Germany judgment of 21 February 1984, Series A no. 73, p. 18, para. 50, and the Demicoli v. Malta judgment of 27 August 1991, Series A no. 210, pp. 15-17, paras. 31-34).  \r\n33.   Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.  This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.  Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).  In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 15 above).\r\nThese considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as \"criminal\" for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that Article 6 (art. 6) applies.\r\n2. Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention  \r\n34.   According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.  There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to \"measures for the deprivation of liberty\" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures. Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.  That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison.\r\nAdmittedly, the Tyrol Building Regulations Act 1978 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.  However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.  It mattered little in this respect that section 53 of the Tyrol Building Regulations Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Tyrol Building Regulations Act 1901.  \r\n35.   The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.  In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:\r\n\"1.   Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision.  Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).  \r\n2.   Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.\"  \r\nSecondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.  \r\n36.   The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).  It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.  They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.\r\nThe Court notes that Mr Pramstaller based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.  Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.  Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Tyrol Building Regulations Act 1978, were applied.\r\nThese considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.  \r\nB. Compliance with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1)\r\n1. Access to a tribunal  \r\n37.   Mr Pramstaller contended that none of the bodies that had dealt with his case in the proceedings in issue could be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.  The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 22 above).  It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.  Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.  In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.  \r\n38.   The Government contested this view, whereas the Commission accepted it.  \r\n39.   The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraph 11 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments: Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).  \r\n40.   The Constitutional Court is not such a body.  In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts.  It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  \r\n41.   The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.  It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a \"judicial body that has full jurisdiction\".  These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.  As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a \"tribunal\" within the meaning of the Convention.  Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the review carried out by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 24 above).  \r\n42.   It follows that the applicant did not have access to a \"tribunal\".  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point.\r\n2. Lack of a hearing  \r\n43.   Mr Pramstaller further criticised the Administrative Court for failing to hold a hearing.  \r\n44.   Having regard to the conclusion in paragraph 42 above, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint.  \r\nII.   APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 50 (art. 50) OF THE CONVENTION  \r\n45.   Under Article 50 (art. 50) of the Convention,  \r\n\"If the Court finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention, and if the internal law of the said Party allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure, the decision of the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"  \r\n46.   The Delegate of the Commission left the matter of just satisfaction to the discretion of the Court.  \r\nA. Damage  \r\n47.   In respect of pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed repayment of the fine imposed on him, that is to say ATS 60,000.  He also claimed ATS 20,000 for non-pecuniary damage.  \r\n48.   The Government contended that the Court had no jurisdiction to quash convictions pronounced by national courts or to order repayment of fines.  Moreover, it could not, in awarding reparation, speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings would have been if the applicant had had access to a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.  \r\n49.   The Court agrees.  It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47).  It considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the present judgment affords the applicant sufficient reparation.\r\nB. Costs and expenses  \r\n50.   In addition, Mr Pramstaller claimed the sum of ATS 203,763 for the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings first in the domestic courts and then before the Convention institutions.  \r\n51.   The Government expressed the view that only the proceedings in the Administrative Court - which had given rise to the alleged violations - and those in Strasbourg could be taken into account.  They also contested the quantum of the costs, but they were prepared to reimburse a total of ATS 300,000 in respect of the Umlauft, Pramstaller, Palaoro and Pfarrmeier cases, the applicants in all these cases having been represented by the same lawyer.  \r\n52.   Making an assessment on an equitable basis, having regard to the information in its possession and its case-law, the Court awards Mr Pramstaller ATS 100,000.  \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY  \r\n1.   Holds that Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention applies in this case;  \r\n\r\n2.   Holds that there has been a violation of that Article (art. 6-1) as regards access to a court;  \r\n\r\n3.   Holds that it is not necessary to examine the complaint based on the lack of a hearing in the Administrative Court;  \r\n\r\n4.   Holds that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, 100,000 (one hundred thousand) Austrian schillings in respect of costs and expenses;  \r\n\r\n5.   Dismisses the remainder of the claim for just satisfaction.  \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 23 October 1995.  \r\n\r\n\t\tRolv RYSSDAL\r\n\t\tPresident\r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 (art. 51-2) of the Convention and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the separate opinion of Mr Martens is annexed to this judgment.  \r\n\r\nR. R.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n \r\nSEPARATE OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS  \r\n1.   I concur in the Court's finding that Article 6 (art. 6) has been violated, but cannot agree with its reasoning.  \r\n2.   My objections concern paragraph 41 of the judgment, which starts with the statement:  \r\n\"The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.\"  \r\n3.   I will refrain from a structural criticism of this paragraph. I cannot help noting, however, that here again the Court finds it necessary to remark that when it is being assessed whether or not the Administrative Court is to be considered a court that affords the safeguards of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1), \"regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court\".  One looks in vain, however, for evidence of this methodological principle being put into practice: there does not follow any analysis of what the applicant argued before the Administrative Court, nor is there any trace of \"regard\" to these arguments in the assessment of the adequacy of the Administrative Court's jurisdiction.  For the rest, I refer to the methodological objections to this \"test\" that I raised in paragraph 18 of my separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria (judgment of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312).  \r\n4.   My main objection to this paragraph is the following.  In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).  In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.  One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"criminal\" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an \"administrative\" one but under the Convention is a \"civil\" one.  I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6)  .  Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument.  This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law  . \r\n\r\n  I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria.\r\n  See, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53; the Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium judgment of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 17, para. 30; see also the Diennet v. France judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 325-A, pp. 13-14, para. 28.\r\n\r\n",

THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n\r\n(Application no. 17419/90)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n25 November 1996 \r\n \r\nIn the case of Wingrove v. the United Kingdom ,\r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:\r\n\tMr \tR. BERNHARDT, President,\r\n\tMr \tT. VILHJÁLMSSON,\r\n\tMr \tL.-E. PETTITI,\r\n\tMr \tJ. DE MEYER,\r\n\tMr \tJ.M. MORENILLA,\r\n\tSir \tJOHN FREELAND,\r\n\tMr \tG. MIFSUD BONNICI,\r\n\tMr \tD. GOTCHEV,\r\n\tMr \tU. LOHMUS,\r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar,\r\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 March, 27 September and 22 October 1996,\r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\r\nPROCEDURE\r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 1 March 1995 and by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\"the Government\") on 22 March 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 17419/90) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a British national, Mr Nigel Wingrove, on 18 June 1990.\r\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the United Kingdom recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government’s application referred to Article 48 (art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10).\r\n\r\n    The case is numbered 19/1995/525/611. The first number is the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court in the relevant year (second number). The last two numbers indicate the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court since its creation and on the list of the corresponding originating applications to the Commission.\r\n    Rules A apply to all cases referred to the Court before the entry into force of Protocol No. 9 (P9) (1 October 1994) and thereafter only to cases concerning States not bound by that Protocol (P9). They correspond to the Rules that came into force on 1 January 1983, as amended several times subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).\r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Sir John Freeland, the elected judge of British nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Bernhardt, the Vice-President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 4 (b)). On 5 May 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President of the Court, Mr R. Ryssdal, drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr L.-E. Pettiti, Mr R. Macdonald, Mr J. De Meyer, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr G. Mifsud Bonnici, Mr D. Gotchev and Mr U. Lohmus (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 5) (art. 43). Subsequently, Mr Thór Vilhjálmsson, substitute judge, replaced Mr Macdonald, who was unable to take part in the further consideration of the case (Rules 22 para. 1 and 24 para. 1).\r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 6), Mr Bernhardt, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant’s lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). Pursuant to the order made in consequence, the Registrar received the Government’s and the applicant’s memorials on 24 November 1995. The Secretary to the Commission subsequently informed the Registrar that the Delegate did not wish to reply in writing to the memorials filed.\r\n5.   On 17 November 1995, the President, having consulted the Chamber, had granted leave to Rights International, a New York-based non-governmental human rights organisation, to submit written comments on specified aspects of the case (Rule 37 para. 2). Leave was also granted on the same date, subject to certain conditions, to two London-based non-governmental human rights organisations, namely Interights and Article 19, to submit joint written comments. The comments were received between 2 and 5 January 1996. On 1 February 1996 the applicant submitted an explanatory statement on the origins and meaning of his video work.\r\n6.   In accordance with the President’s decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 March 1996. Beforehand, the Court had held a preparatory meeting and had viewed the video recording in issue in the presence of the applicant and his representatives.\r\nThere appeared before the Court:\r\n(a) for the Government\r\n\t\tMr M.R. EATON, Deputy Legal Adviser, Foreign and\r\n\t\t\tCommonwealth Office, \tAgent,\r\n\t\tSir Derek SPENCER, Solicitor-General,\r\n\t\tMr P. HAVERS QC,\r\n\t\tMr N. LAVENDER, \tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr C. WHOMERSLEY, Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers,\r\n\t\tMr R. CLAYTON, Home Office,\r\n\t\tMr L. HUGHES, Home Office,\tAdvisers;\r\n(b) for the Commission\r\n\t\tMr N. BRATZA, \tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant\r\n\t\tMr G. ROBERTSON, QC, \tCounsel,\r\n\t\tMr M. STEPHENS,\r\n\t\tMr P. CHINNERY, \tSolicitors.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Bratza, Mr Robertson and Sir Derek Spencer.\r\nAS TO THE FACTS\r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\r\n7.   The applicant, Mr Nigel Wingrove, is a film director. He was born in 1957 and resides in London.\r\n8.   Mr Wingrove wrote the shooting script for, and directed the making of, a video work entitled Visions of Ecstasy. Its running time is approximately eighteen minutes, and it contains no dialogue, only music and moving images. According to the applicant, the idea for the film was derived from the life and writings of St Teresa of Avila, the sixteenth-century Carmelite nun and founder of many convents, who experienced powerful ecstatic visions of Jesus Christ.\r\n9.   The action of the film centres upon a youthful actress dressed as a nun and intended to represent St Teresa. It begins with the nun, dressed loosely in a black habit, stabbing her own hand with a large nail and spreading her blood over her naked breasts and clothing. In her writhing, she spills a chalice of communion wine and proceeds to lick it up from the ground. She loses consciousness. This sequence takes up approximately half of the running time of the video. The second part shows St Teresa dressed in a white habit standing with her arms held above her head by a white cord which is suspended from above and tied around her wrists. The near-naked form of a second female, said to represent St Teresa’s psyche, slowly crawls her way along the ground towards her. Upon reaching St Teresa’s feet, the psyche begins to caress her feet and legs, then her midriff, then her breasts, and finally exchanges passionate kisses with her. Throughout this sequence, St Teresa appears to be writhing in exquisite erotic sensation. This sequence is intercut at frequent intervals with a second sequence in which one sees the body of Christ, fastened to the cross which is lying upon the ground. St Teresa first kisses the stigmata of his feet before moving up his body and kissing or licking the gaping wound in his right side. Then she sits astride him, seemingly naked under her habit, all the while moving in a motion reflecting intense erotic arousal, and kisses his lips. For a few seconds, it appears that he responds to her kisses. This action is intercut with the passionate kisses of the psyche already described. Finally, St Teresa runs her hand down to the fixed hand of Christ and entwines his fingers in hers. As she does so, the fingers of Christ seem to curl upwards to hold with hers, whereupon the video ends.\r\n10.   Apart from the cast list which appears on the screen for a few seconds, the viewer has no means of knowing from the film itself that the person dressed as a nun in the video is intended to be St Teresa or that the other woman who appears is intended to be her psyche. No attempt is made in the video to explain its historical background.\r\n11.   Visions of Ecstasy was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (\"the Board\"), being the authority designated by the Home Secretary under section 4 (1) of the Video Recordings Act 1984 (\"the 1984 Act\" - see paragraph 24 below) as\r\n\"the authority responsible for making arrangements (a) for determining, for the purposes of [the] Act whether or not video works are suitable for classification certificates to be issued in respect of them, having special regard to the likelihood of video works in respect of which such certificates have been issued being viewed in the home, (b) in the case of works which are determined in accordance with the arrangements to be so suitable (i) for making such other determinations as are required for the issue of classification certificates, and (ii) for issuing such certificates ... ...\"\r\n12.   The applicant submitted the video to the Board in order that it might lawfully be sold, hired out or otherwise supplied to the general public or a section thereof.\r\n13.   The Board rejected the application for a classification certificate on 18 September 1989 in the following terms:\r\n\"Further to your application for a classification certificate ..., you are already aware that under the Video Recordings Act 1984 the Board must determine first of all whether or not a video work is suitable for such a certificate to be issued to it, having special regard to the likelihood of video works being viewed in the home. In making this judgment, the Board must have regard to the Home Secretary’s Letter of Designation in which we are enjoined to `continue to seek to avoid classifying works which are obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 or which infringe other provisions of the criminal law’. Amongst these provisions is the criminal law of blasphemy, as tested recently in the House of Lords in R. v. Lemon (1979), commonly known as the Gay News case. The definition of blasphemy cited therein is ‘any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible ... It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion’ if the publication is ‘decent and temperate’. The question is not one of the matter expressed, but of its manner, i.e. `the tone, style and spirit’, in which it is presented. The video work submitted by you depicts the mingling of religious ecstasy and sexual passion, a matter which may be of legitimate concern to the artist. It becomes subject to the law of blasphemy, however, if the manner of its presentation is bound to give rise to outrage at the unacceptable treatment of a sacred subject. Because the wounded body of the crucified Christ is presented solely as the focus of, and at certain moments a participant in, the erotic desire of St Teresa, with no attempt to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in an erotic experience, it is the Board’s view, and that of its legal advisers, that a reasonable jury properly directed would find that the work infringes the criminal law of blasphemy. To summarise, it is not the case that the sexual imagery in Visions of Ecstasy lies beyond the parameters of the `18’ category; it is simply that for a major proportion of the work’s duration that sexual imagery is focused on the figure of the crucified Christ. If the male figure were not Christ, the problem would not arise. Cuts of a fairly radical nature in the overt expressions of sexuality between St Teresa and the Christ figure might be practicable, but I understand that you do not wish to attempt this course of action. In consequence, we have concluded that it would not be suitable for a classification certificate to be issued to this video work.\"\r\n14.   The applicant appealed against the Board’s determination to the Video Appeals Committee (\"the VAC\" - see paragraph 25 below), established pursuant to section 4 (3) of the 1984 Act. His notice of appeal, prepared by his legal representatives at the time, contained the following grounds:\r\n\"(i) that the Board was wrong to conclude that the video infringes the criminal law of blasphemy, and that a reasonable jury properly directed would so find; (ii) in particular, the Appellant will contend that upon a proper understanding of the serious nature of the video as an artistic and imaginative interpretation of the `ecstasy’ or `rapture’ of the sixteenth-century Carmelite nun, St Teresa of Avila, it would not be taken by a reasonable person as contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous or otherwise disparaging in relation to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible. The appeal will raise the question of mixed fact and law, namely whether publication of the video, even to a restricted degree, would contravene the existing criminal law of blasphemy.\"\r\n15.   The Board submitted a formal reply to the VAC explaining its decision in relation to its functions under section 4 of the 1984 Act:\r\n\"The Act does not expressly set out the principles to be applied by the authority in determining whether or not a video work is suitable for a classification certificate to be issued in respect of it. In these circumstances, the Board has exercised its discretion to formulate principles for classifying video works in a manner which it believes to be both reasonable and suited to carrying out the broad objectives of the Act. Amongst these principles, the Board has concluded that an overriding test of suitability for classification is the determination that the video work in question does not infringe the criminal law. In formulating and applying this principle, the Board has consistently had regard to the Home Secretary’s Letter of Designation under the Video Recordings Act ... The Board has concluded on the advice of leading Counsel that the video work in question infringes the criminal law of blasphemy and that a reasonable jury properly directed on the law would convict accordingly. The Board submits and is advised that in Britain the offence of blasphemy is committed if a video work treats a religious subject (in particular God, Jesus Christ or the Bible) in such a manner as to be calculated (that is, bound, not intended) to outrage those who have an understanding of, sympathy towards and support for the Christian story and ethic, because of the contemptuous, reviling, insulting, scurrilous or ludicrous tone, style and spirit in which the subject is presented. The video work under appeal purports to depict the erotic fantasies of a character described in the credits as St Teresa of Avila. The 14-minute second section of the video work portrays ‘St Teresa’ having an erotic fantasy involving the crucified figure of Christ, and also a Lesbian erotic fantasy involving the ‘Psyche of St Teresa’. No attempt is made to place what is shown in any historical, religious or dramatic context: the figures of St Teresa and her psyche are both clearly modern in appearance and the erotic images are accompanied by a rock music backing. The work contains no dialogue or evidence of an interest in exploring the psychology or even the sexuality of the character purporting to be St Teresa of Avila. Instead, this character and her supposed fantasies about lesbianism and the body and blood of Christ are presented as the occasion for a series of erotic images of a kind familiar from ‘soft-core’ pornography. In support of its contentions, the Board refers to an interview given by the appellant and published in Midweek magazine on 14 September 1989. In this interview, the appellant attempts to draw a distinction between pornography and ‘erotica’, denying that the video work in question is pornographic but stating that `all my own work is actually erotica’. Further on, the interviewer comments: `In many ways, though, Visions calls upon the standard lexicon of lust found in down market porn: nuns, lesbianism, women tied up (Gay Nuns in Bondage could have been an alternative title in fact). Nigel Wingrove flashes a wicked grin. `That’s right, and I’m not denying it. I don’t know what it is about nuns, it’s the same sort of thing as white stocking tops I suppose.’ So why does he not consider Visions to be pornography, or at least soft porn? `I hope it is gentler, subtler than that. I suppose most people think pornography shows the sex act, and this doesn’t.’ It is clear from the appellant’s own admissions that, whether or not the video work can rightly be described as pornographic, it is solely erotic in content, and it focuses this erotic imagery for much of its duration on the body and blood of Christ, who is even shown to respond to the sexual attentions of the principal character. Moreover, the manner in which such imagery is treated places the focus of the work less on the erotic feelings of the character than on those of the audience, which is the primary function of pornography whether or not it shows the sex act explicitly. Because there is no attempt, in the Board’s view, to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in a voyeuristic erotic experience, the Board considers that the public distribution of such a video work would outrage and insult the feelings of believing Christians ... ... The Board ... submits that the appeal should be dismissed and its determination upheld.\"\r\n16.   The applicant then made further representations to the VAC, stating, inter alia:\r\n\"The definition of the offence of blasphemy set out in ... the reply is too wide, being significantly wider than the test approved in the only modern authority - see Lemon & Gay News Ltd v. Whitehouse [1979] Appeal Cases 617, per Lord Scarman at 665. For example, there is no uniform law of blasphemy in Britain; the last recorded prosecution for blasphemy under the law of Scotland was in 1843 - see Thos Paterson [1843] I Brown 629. Nor is any religious subject protected - the reviling matter must be in relation to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England as by law established. In the Appellant’s contention, these limitations are of the utmost significance in this case since the video is not concerned with anything which God or Jesus Christ did, or thought or might have approved of. It is about the erotic visions and imaginings of a sixteenth-century Carmelite nun - namely St Teresa of Avila. It is quite plain that the Christ figure exists in her fantasy as the Board expressly accepts ... The scurrilous and/or erotic treatment of religious subject matter has received the Board’s classification without attempted prosecution in recent years, e.g. Monty Python’s Life of Brian and Mr Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ. ... The Board argues that the video is purely erotic or ‘soft-core’ pornographic, without historical, religious, dramatic or other artistic merit. The implication is that, had it possessed such merit the Board’s decision might very well have been otherwise. The Appellant will seek to argue and call evidence to the effect that the video work is a serious treatment of the subject of the ecstatic raptures of St Teresa (well chronicled in her own works and those of commentators) from a twentieth-century point of view. The so-called ‘rock music backing’ was in fact specially commissioned from the respected composer Steven Severin, after discussion of the Director’s desired artistic and emotional impact. The Board has based its decision upon the narrowest, most disparaging, critical appreciation of the work. The Appellant will contend that a very much more favourable assessment of his aims and achievement in making Visions of Ecstasy is, at the very least, tenable and that the Board ought not to refuse a certificate on a mere matter of interpretation. The Appellant takes objection to the Board’s quotation ... of comments attributed to him from an article by one Rob Ryan published in Midweek magazine 14th September 1989. The remarks are pure hearsay so far as the Board is concerned. That aside, the piece quoted is in large part the comments of the author of the article. An entirely misleading impression of what the Appellant said to the author is conveyed by the interpolation of the words attributed to him, and by taking this passage out of context. Above all, the Appellant disputes the key assertion by the Board that the video work is solely erotic in content.\"\r\n17.   The appeal was heard by a five-member panel of the VAC (\"the Panel\") on 6 and 7 December 1989; oral and affidavit evidence was submitted. By a majority of three to two, a written decision rejecting the appeal was given on 23 December 1989. The Panel also considered itself bound by the criteria set out in the designation notice (see paragraph 24 below). It had difficulty, however, in ascertaining and applying the present law of blasphemy. It commented as follows:\r\n\"The authorities on this Common Law offence were reviewed by the House of Lords in the case of Lemon and Gay News Ltd v. Whitehouse which concerned a magazine called Gay News, the readership of which consisted mainly of homosexuals although it was on sale to the general public at some bookstalls. One edition contained a poem entitled The Love that Dares to Speak its Name accompanied by a drawing illustrating its subject matter. In his judgment Lord Scarman said that it was unnecessary to speculate whether an outraged Christian would feel provoked by the words and illustration to commit a breach of the peace, the true test being whether the words are calculated to outrage and insult the Christian’s religious feelings, the material in question being contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England. It should perhaps be added that the word `calculated’ should be read in the dictionary sense of `estimated’ or `likely’ as it was decided that intent (other than an intent to publish) is not an element in the offence. In the same case Lord Diplock said that the material must be `likely to arouse a sense of outrage among those who believe in or respect the Christian faith’. In the present case the Board’s Director ... said in evidence that the Board’s view was that the video was `contemptuous of the divinity of Christ’. He added that although the Board’s decision was based upon its view that the video is blasphemous (blasphemy being an offence which relates only to the Christian religion), it would take just the same stance if it were asked to grant a Certificate to a video which, for instance, was contemptuous of Mohammed or Buddha.\"\r\n18.   The Panel went on to review the content of the video and accepted that the applicant had in mind St Teresa, a nun, \"who is known to have had ecstatic visions of Christ although, incidentally, these did not start until she was 39 years of age - in marked contrast to the obvious youthfulness of the actress who plays the part\".\r\n19.   The Panel reached the following conclusion:\r\n\"From the writings of St Teresa herself, and the subsequent writings of others, there seems no reason to doubt that some of her visions were of seeing the glorified body of Christ and being shown his wounds but, even so, it seems clear that Mr Wingrove has taken considerable artistic licence with his subject. Apart from the age discrepancy - a comparatively minor matter - we were made aware of nothing which would suggest that Teresa ever did anything to injure her hand or that any element of lesbianism ever entered into her visions. More importantly, there seems nothing to suggest that Teresa, in her visions, ever saw herself as being in any bodily contact with the glorified Christ. As one author, Mr Stephen Clissold, puts it `Teresa experienced ecstasy as a form of prayer in which she herself played almost no part’. So, in view of the extent of the artistic licence, we think it would be reasonable to look upon the video as centring upon any nun of any century who, like many others down the ages, had ecstatic visions. There is also another reason for taking this stance: unless the viewer happens to read the cast list which appears on the screen for a few seconds, he or she has no means of knowing that the nun is supposed to be St Teresa, nor that the figure of the second woman is supposed to be her psyche. And he or she in any event may well be unaware that Teresa was a real-life nun who had ecstatic visions. It is true that Mr Wingrove says that it is intended that the sleeve or jacket for the video will provide ‘basic historical information to assist the viewer’, but we feel bound to regard this as irrelevant. Firstly because it by no means follows that every viewer will read any such description; and secondly because the Board’s and the Appeal Panel’s decision must be based solely upon the video itself, quite apart from the fact that at the time of making a decision the sleeve or jacket is usually - as in the present instance - not even in existence. However, although we have thought it proper to dwell at some length with the ‘St Teresa’ aspect, we are of the opinion that in practice, when considering whether or not the video is blasphemous, it makes little or no difference whether one looks upon the central character as being St Teresa or any other nun. The appellant, in his written statement, lays stress upon the undoubted fact that the whole of the second half consists of Teresa’s vision or dream. Hence he says the video says nothing about Christ, his figure being used only as a projection of St Teresa’s mind, nor was it his intention to make that figure an active participant in any overt sexual act. He goes on to say `Rather the very mild responses are those of St Teresa’s conjecture: the kiss, hand clasp and ultimately the tears of Christ. To show no response to a creation of her own mind would be nonsense; no woman (nor man) whose deep love could cause such visions/ecstasies would imagine the object of that love coldly to ignore their caresses’. Although we quite appreciate the logic of this point of view, we have reservations about the extent to which a vision or dream sequence can affect the question of whether what is pictured or said is blasphemous. It would, for instance, be possible to produce a film or video which was most extremely contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous in relation to Christ, all dressed up in the context of someone’s imaginings. In such circumstances we find it hard to envisage that, by such a simple device, it could reasonably be said that no offence had been committed. If in our opinion the viewer, after making proper allowance for the scene being in the form of a dream, nevertheless reasonably feels that it would cause a sense of outrage and insult to a Christian’s feelings, the offence would be established. We should perhaps also deal, albeit briefly, with a further submission made on behalf of the appellant, namely that the crime of blasphemy may extend only to the written or spoken word and hence that a court might rule that no film or video, and perhaps nothing shown on television, could become the subject of such a charge. Suffice it to say that in our view this is too unlikely to cause it to be taken into account by the Board or a panel of the Appeals Committee when reaching a decision. In the opinion of a majority of the Panel the video did not, as the appellant claims, explore St Teresa’s struggles against her visions but exploited a devotion to Christ in purely carnal terms. Furthermore they considered that it lacked the seriousness and depth of The Last Temptation of Christ with which Counsel for the appellant sought to compare it. Indeed the majority took the view that the video’s message was that the nun was moved not by religious ecstasy but rather by sexual ecstasy, this ecstasy being of a perverse kind - full of images of blood, sado-masochism, lesbianism (or perhaps auto-erotism) and bondage. Although there was evidence of some element of repressed sexuality in St Teresa’s devotion to Christ, they did not consider that this gave any ground for portraying her as taking the initiative in indulged sexuality. They considered the over-all tone and spirit of the video to be indecent and had little doubt that all the above factors, coupled with the motions of the nun whilst astride the body of Christ and the response to her kisses and the intertwining of the fingers would outrage the feelings of Christians, who would reasonably look upon it as being contemptuous of the divinity of Christ. In these circumstances the majority were satisfied that the video is blasphemous, that a reasonable and properly directed jury would be likely to convict and therefore that the Board was right to refuse to grant a Certificate. Hence this appeal is accordingly dismissed. It should perhaps be added that the minority on the Panel, whilst being in no doubt that many people would find the video to be extremely distasteful, would have allowed the appeal because in their view it is unlikely that a reasonable and properly directed jury would convict.\"\r\n20.   As a result of the Board’s determination, as upheld by the Panel, the applicant would commit an offence under section 9 of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 23 below) if he were to supply the video in any manner, whether or not for reward.\r\n21.   The applicant received legal advice that his case was not suitable for judicial review (see paragraphs 30-31 below) on the grounds that the formulation of the law of blasphemy, as accepted by the Panel, was an \"accurate statement of the present law\".\r\nII.   SITUATION OF THE VIDEO INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\r\n22.   According to statistics submitted by the Government, in 1994 there were 21.5 million video-recorders in the United Kingdom. Out of approximately 20.75 million households in the United Kingdom, 18 million contained at least one video-recorder. There were approximately 15,000 video outlets in the United Kingdom. Videos were available for hire in between 4,000 and 5,000 video rental shops. They were also available for sale in 3,000 \"high street\" shops and in between 7,000 and 8,000 \"secondary\" outlets such as supermarkets, corner shops and petrol stations. In 1994 there were 194 million video rentals and 66 million video purchases in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that a further 65 million illegal copies (\"pirate videos\") were distributed during that year.\r\nIII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\r\nA. The regulation of video works\r\n23.   The Video Recordings Act 1984 (\"the 1984 Act\") regulates the distribution of video works. Subject to certain exemptions, it is an offence under section 9 (1) of that Act for a person to supply or offer to supply a video work in respect of which no classification certificate has been issued. Under section 7 there are three categories of classification: works deemed suitable for general viewing (and to which a parental guidance reference may be added); works for which the viewing is restricted to people who have attained a specified age; and works which may only be supplied by licensed sex shops. The Secretary of State for the Home Department may require that the content of certain works be labelled (section 8). It is an offence to ignore such conditions, for example by supplying someone under 18 years of age with an \"18\" classified work (section 11).\r\n24.   Under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act the Secretary of State may by notice designate any person or body as the authority for making arrangements for determining whether or not video works are suitable for classification certificates to be issued in respect of them (having special regard to the likelihood of certified video works being viewed in the home). By a notice dated 26 July 1985 the British Board of Film Classification was so designated. In the case of works which are determined in accordance with the arrangements described above to be suitable for classification certificates, the Board is responsible under section 4 (1) for making arrangements for the issue of certificates and making other determinations relating to their use. The Secretary of State’s notice enjoined the Board \"to continue to seek to avoid classifying works which are obscene within the meaning of the Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 or which infringe other provisions of the criminal law\".\r\n25.   Pursuant to section 4 (3) of the 1984 Act arrangements were made for the establishment of the Video Appeals Committee to determine appeals against decisions by the Board.\r\nB. The law of blasphemy\r\n26.   Blasphemy and blasphemous libel are common law offences triable on indictment and punishable by fine or imprisonment. Blasphemy consists in speaking and blasphemous libel in otherwise publishing blasphemous matter. Libel involves a publication in a permanent form, but that form may consist of moving pictures.\r\n27.   In the case of Whitehouse v. Gay News Ltd and Lemon [1979] Appeal Cases 617 at 665, which concerned the law of blasphemy in England, Lord Scarman held that the modern law of blasphemy was correctly formulated in Article 214 of Stephen’s Digest of the Criminal Law, 9th edition (1950). This states as follows:\r\n\"Every publication is said to be blasphemous which contains any contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of England as by law established. It is not blasphemous to speak or publish opinions hostile to the Christian religion, or to deny the existence of God, if the publication is couched in decent and temperate language. The test to be applied is as to the manner in which the doctrines are advocated and not to the substance of the doctrines themselves.\"\r\nThe House of Lords in that case also decided that the mental element in the offence (mens rea) did not depend upon the accused having an intent to blaspheme. It was sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the publication had been intentional and that the matter published was blasphemous. The Gay News case, which had been brought by a private prosecutor, had been the first prosecution for blasphemy since 1922.\r\n28.   As stated above, the law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England. This was confirmed by the Divisional Court in 1991. Ruling on an application for judicial review of a magistrate’s refusal to issue a summons for blasphemy against Salman Rushdie and the publishers of The Satanic Verses, Lord Watkins stated:\r\n\"We have no doubt that as the law now stands it does not extend to religions other than Christianity ... ... We think it right to say that, were it open to us to extend the law to cover religions other than Christianity, we should refrain from doing so. Considerations of public policy are extremely difficult and complex. It would be virtually impossible by judicial decision to set sufficiently clear limits to the offence, and other problems involved are formidable.\" (R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 318)\r\n29.   On 4 July 1989 the then Minister of State at the Home Department, Mr John Patten, had sent a letter to a number of influential British Muslims, in which he stated inter alia that:\r\n\"Many Muslims have argued that the law of blasphemy should be amended to take books such as [The Satanic Verses] outside the boundary of what is legally acceptable. We have considered their arguments carefully and reached the conclusion that it would be unwise for a variety of reasons to amend the law of blasphemy, not the least the clear lack of agreement over whether the law should be reformed or repealed. ... ... an alteration in the law could lead to a rush of litigation which would damage relations between faiths. I hope you can appreciate how divisive and how damaging such litigation might be, and how inappropriate our legal mechanisms are for dealing with matters of faith and individual belief. Indeed, the Christian faith no longer relies on it, preferring to recognise that the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers.\"\r\nC. The availability of judicial review as a remedy\r\n30.   Decisions by public bodies which have consequences which affect some person or body of persons are susceptible to challenge in the High Court on an application for judicial review. Amongst the grounds on which such a challenge may be brought is that the body in question misdirected itself on a point of law. The Video Appeals Committee is such a public body because it is established pursuant to an Act of Parliament (see paragraph 25 above). Furthermore, its decisions affect the rights of persons who make video works because confirmation of a decision that a video work cannot receive a classification certificate would mean that copies of that work could not be lawfully supplied to members of the public.\r\n31.   On an application for judicial review a court would not normally look at the merits of any decision made by such a body, except where the decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable body, properly instructed, could have reached it. However, where the decision is based on a point of law and it is alleged that the body has misdirected itself on that point, the decision could be challenged by an application for judicial review. In the case of C.C.S.U. v. Minister for the Civil Service [1984] 3 All England Law Reports at 950, Lord Diplock, in the House of Lords, classified under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. He called the first ground \"illegality\" and described it as follows:\r\n\"By ‘illegality’ as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in the event of a dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the State is exercisable.\"\r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION\r\n32.   Mr Wingrove applied to the Commission on 18 June 1990. He relied on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), complaining that the refusal of a classification certificate for his video work Visions of Ecstasy was in breach of his freedom of expression.\r\n33.   The Commission declared the application (no. 17419/90) admissible on 8 March 1994. In its report of 10 January 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the opinion, by fourteen votes to two, that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10). The full text of the Commission’s opinion and of the three separate opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment \r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT\r\n34.   In their final submissions, the Government requested the Court to declare that the facts of the present case disclose no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10). The applicant, for his part, invited the Court to \"produce a judgment which declares the British blasphemy laws as unnecessary in theory as they are in practice in any multi-cultural democracy\".\r\nAS TO THE LAW\r\nI.   ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 10 OF THE CONVENTION (Art. 10)\r\n35.   The applicant alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), which, in so far as relevant, provides:\r\n\"1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers ... 2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.\"\r\n36.   The refusal by the British Board of Film Classification to grant a certificate for the applicant’s video work Visions of Ecstasy, seen in conjunction with the statutory provisions making it a criminal offence to distribute a video work without this certificate (see paragraph 23 above), amounted to an interference by a public authority with the applicant’s right to impart ideas. This was common ground between the participants in the proceedings. To determine whether such an interference entails a violation of the Convention, the Court must examine whether or not it was justified under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) by reason of being a restriction \"prescribed by law\", which pursued an aim that was legitimate under that provision (art. 10-2) and was \"necessary in a democratic society\".\r\n\r\n    For practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printed version of the judgment (in Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V), but a copy of the Commission's report is obtainable from the registry.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Whether the interference was \"prescribed by law\"\r\n37.   The applicant considered that the law of blasphemy was so uncertain that it was inordinately difficult to establish in advance whether in the eyes of a jury a particular publication would constitute an offence. Moreover, it was practically impossible to know what predictions an administrative body - the British Board of Film Classification - would make as to the outcome of a hypothetical prosecution. In these circumstances, the applicant could not reasonably be expected to foresee the result of the Board’s speculations. The requirement of foreseeability which flows from the expression \"prescribed by law\" was therefore not fulfilled.\r\n38.   The Government contested this claim: it was a feature common to most laws and legal systems that tribunals may reach different conclusions even when applying the same law to the same facts. This did not necessarily make these laws inaccessible or unforeseeable. Given the infinite variety of ways of publishing \"contemptuous, reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, Jesus Christ or the Bible\" (see paragraph 27 above), it would not be appropriate for the law to seek to define in detail which images would or would not be potentially blasphemous.\r\n39.   The Commission, noting that considerable legal advice was available to the applicant, was of the view that he could reasonably have foreseen the restrictions to which his video work was liable.\r\n40.   The Court reiterates that, according to its case-law, the relevant national \"law\", which includes both statute and common law (see, inter alia, the Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1) judgment of 26 April 1979, Series A no. 30, p. 30, para. 47), must be formulated with sufficient precision to enable those concerned - if need be, with appropriate legal advice - to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. A law that confers a discretion is not in itself inconsistent with this requirement, provided that the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise are indicated with sufficient clarity, having regard to the legitimate aim in question, to give the individual adequate protection against arbitrary interference (see, for instance, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky v. the United Kingdom judgment of 13 July 1995, Series A no. 316-B, pp. 71-72, para. 37, and the Goodwin v. the United Kingdom judgment of 27 March 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-II, pp. 496-97, para. 31).\r\n41.   It is observed that, in refusing a certificate for distribution of the applicant’s video on the basis that it infringed a provision of the criminal law of blasphemy, the British Board of Film Classification acted within its powers under section 4 (1) of the 1984 Act (see paragraph 24 above).\r\n42.   The Court recognises that the offence of blasphemy cannot by its very nature lend itself to precise legal definition. National authorities must therefore be afforded a degree of flexibility in assessing whether the facts of a particular case fall within the accepted definition of the offence (see, mutatis mutandis, the Tolstoy Miloslavsky judgment cited above at paragraph 40, p. 73, para. 41).\r\n43.   There appears to be no general uncertainty or disagreement between those appearing before the Court as to the definition in English law of the offence of blasphemy, as formulated by the House of Lords in the case of Whitehouse v. Gay News Ltd and Lemon (see paragraph 27 above). Having seen for itself the content of the video work, the Court is satisfied that the applicant could reasonably have foreseen with appropriate legal advice that the film, particularly those scenes involving the crucified figure of Christ, could fall within the scope of the offence of blasphemy. The above conclusion is borne out by the applicant’s decision not to initiate proceedings for judicial review on the basis of counsel’s advice that the Panel’s formulation of the law of blasphemy represented an accurate statement of the law (see, mutatis mutandis, the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v. Ireland judgment of 29 October 1992, Series A no. 246-A, p. 27, para. 60).\r\n44.   Against this background it cannot be said that the law in question did not afford the applicant adequate protection against arbitrary interference. The Court therefore concludes that the impugned restriction was \"prescribed by law\".\r\nB. Whether the interference pursued a legitimate aim\r\n45.   The applicant contested the Government’s assertion that his video work was refused a certificate for distribution in order to \"protect the right of citizens not to be offended in their religious feelings\". In his submission, the expression \"rights of others\" in the present context only refers to an actual, positive right not to be offended. It does not include a hypothetical right held by some Christians to avoid disturbance at the prospect of other people’s viewing the video work without being shocked. In any event - the applicant further submitted - the restriction on the film’s distribution could not pursue a legitimate aim since it was based on a discriminatory law, limited to the protection of Christians, and specifically, those of the Anglican faith.\r\n46.   The Government referred to the case of Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria (judgment of 20 September 1994, Series A no. 295-A, pp. 17-18, paras. 47-48) where the Court had accepted that respect for the religious feelings of believers can move a State legitimately to restrict the publication of provocative portrayals of objects of religious veneration.\r\n47.   The Commission considered that the English law of blasphemy is intended to suppress behaviour directed against objects of religious veneration that is likely to cause justified indignation amongst believing Christians. It follows that the application of this law in the present case was intended to protect the right of citizens not to be insulted in their religious feelings.\r\n48.   The Court notes at the outset that, as stated by the Board, the aim of the interference was to protect against the treatment of a religious subject in such a manner \"as to be calculated (that is, bound, not intended) to outrage those who have an understanding of, sympathy towards and support for the Christian story and ethic, because of the contemptuous, reviling, insulting, scurrilous or ludicrous tone, style and spirit in which the subject is presented\" (see paragraph 15 above). This is an aim which undoubtedly corresponds to that of the protection of \"the rights of others\" within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2). It is also fully consonant with the aim of the protections afforded by Article 9 (art. 9) to religious freedom.\r\n49.   Whether or not there was a real need for protection against exposure to the film in question is a matter which must be addressed below when assessing the \"necessity\" of the interference.\r\n50.   It is true that the English law of blasphemy only extends to the Christian faith. Indeed the anomaly of this state of affairs in a multidenominational society was recognised by the Divisional Court in R. v. Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Choudhury [1991] 1 All England Law Reports 306 at 317 (see paragraph 28 above). However, it is not for the European Court to rule in abstracto as to the compatibility of domestic law with the Convention. The extent to which English law protects other beliefs is not in issue before the Court which must confine its attention to the case before it (see, for example, the Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, p. 18, para. 33). The uncontested fact that the law of blasphemy does not treat on an equal footing the different religions practised in the United Kingdom does not detract from the legitimacy of the aim pursued in the present context.\r\n51.   The refusal to grant a certificate for the distribution of Visions of Ecstasy consequently had a legitimate aim under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2).\r\nC. Whether the interference was \"necessary in a democratic society\"\r\n52.   The Court recalls that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society. As paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) expressly recognises, however, the exercise of that freedom carries with it duties and responsibilities. Amongst them, in the context of religious beliefs, may legitimately be included a duty to avoid as far as possible an expression that is, in regard to objects of veneration, gratuitously offensive to others and profanatory (see the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, pp. 18-19, paras. 47 and 49).\r\n53.   No restriction on freedom of expression, whether in the context of religious beliefs or in any other, can be compatible with Article 10 (art. 10) unless it satisfies, inter alia, the test of necessity as required by the second paragraph of that Article (art. 10-2). In examining whether restrictions to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention can be considered \"necessary in a democratic society\" the Court has, however, consistently held that the Contracting States enjoy a certain but not unlimited margin of appreciation. It is, in any event, for the European Court to give a final ruling on the restriction’s compatibility with the Convention and it will do so by assessing in the circumstances of a particular case, inter alia, whether the interference corresponded to a \"pressing social need\" and whether it was \"proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\" (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Goodwin judgment cited above at paragraph 40, pp. 500-01, para. 40).\r\n54.   According to the applicant, there was no \"pressing social need\" to ban a video work on the uncertain assumption that it would breach the law of blasphemy; indeed, the overriding social need was to allow it to be distributed. Furthermore, since adequate protection was already provided by a panoply of laws - concerning, inter alia, obscenity, public order and disturbances to places of religious worship - blasphemy laws, which are incompatible with the European idea of freedom of expression, were also superfluous in practice. In any event, the complete prohibition of a video work that contained no obscenity, no pornography and no element of vilification of Christ was disproportionate to the aim pursued.\r\n55.   For the Commission, the fact that Visions of Ecstasy was a short video work and not a feature film meant that its distribution would have been more limited and less likely to attract publicity. The Commission came to the same conclusion as the applicant.\r\n56.   The Government contended that the applicant’s video work was clearly a provocative and indecent portrayal of an object of religious veneration, that its distribution would have been sufficiently public and widespread to cause offence and that it amounted to an attack on the religious beliefs of Christians which was insulting and offensive. In those circumstances, in refusing to grant a classification certificate for the applicant’s video work, the national authorities only acted within their margin of appreciation.\r\n57.   The Court observes that the refusal to grant Visions of Ecstasy a distribution certificate was intended to protect \"the rights of others\", and more specifically to provide protection against seriously offensive attacks on matters regarded as sacred by Christians (see paragraph 48 above). The laws to which the applicant made reference (see paragraph 54 above) and which pursue related but distinct aims are thus not relevant in this context. As the observations filed by the intervenors (see paragraph 5 above) show, blasphemy legislation is still in force in various European countries. It is true that the application of these laws has become increasingly rare and that several States have recently repealed them altogether. In the United Kingdom only two prosecutions concerning blasphemy have been brought in the last seventy years (see paragraph 27 above). Strong arguments have been advanced in favour of the abolition of blasphemy laws, for example, that such laws may discriminate against different faiths or denominations - as put forward by the applicant - or that legal mechanisms are inadequate to deal with matters of faith or individual belief - as recognised by the Minister of State at the Home Department in his letter of 4 July 1989 (see paragraph 29 above). However, the fact remains that there is as yet not sufficient common ground in the legal and social orders of the member States of the Council of Europe to conclude that a system whereby a State can impose restrictions on the propagation of material on the basis that it is blasphemous is, in itself, unnecessary in a democratic society and thus incompatible with the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment cited above at paragraph 46, p. 19, para. 49).\r\n58.   Whereas there is little scope under Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2) for restrictions on political speech or on debate of questions of public interest (see, mutatis mutandis, among many other authorities, the Lingens v. Austria judgment of 8 July 1986, Series A no. 103, p. 26, para. 42; the Castells v. Spain judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 23, para. 43; and the Thorgeir Thorgeirson v. Iceland judgment of 25 June 1992, Series A no. 239, p. 27, para. 63), a wider margin of appreciation is generally available to the Contracting States when regulating freedom of expression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within the sphere of morals or, especially, religion. Moreover, as in the field of morals, and perhaps to an even greater degree, there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of \"the protection of the rights of others\" in relation to attacks on their religious convictions. What is likely to cause substantial offence to persons of a particular religious persuasion will vary significantly from time to time and from place to place, especially in an era characterised by an ever growing array of faiths and denominations. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements with regard to the rights of others as well as on the \"necessity\" of a \"restriction\" intended to protect from such material those whose deepest feelings and convictions would be seriously offended (see, mutatis mutandis, the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment of 24 May 1988, Series A no. 133, p. 22, para. 35). This does not of course exclude final European supervision. Such supervision is all the more necessary given the breadth and open-endedness of the notion of blasphemy and the risks of arbitrary or excessive interferences with freedom of expression under the guise of action taken against allegedly blasphemous material. In this regard the scope of the offence of blasphemy and the safeguards inherent in the legislation are especially important. Moreover the fact that the present case involves prior restraint calls for special scrutiny by the Court (see, mutatis mutandis, the Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 30, para. 60).\r\n59.   The Court’s task in this case is to determine whether the reasons relied on by the national authorities to justify the measures interfering with the applicant’s freedom of expression are relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 10-2).\r\n60.   As regards the content of the law itself, the Court observes that the English law of blasphemy does not prohibit the expression, in any form, of views hostile to the Christian religion. Nor can it be said that opinions which are offensive to Christians necessarily fall within its ambit. As the English courts have indicated (see paragraph 27 above), it is the manner in which views are advocated rather than the views themselves which the law seeks to control. The extent of insult to religious feelings must be significant, as is clear from the use by the courts of the adjectives \"contemptuous\", \"reviling\", \"scurrilous\", \"ludicrous\" to depict material of a sufficient degree of offensiveness. The high degree of profanation that must be attained constitutes, in itself, a safeguard against arbitrariness. It is against this background that the asserted justification under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in the decisions of the national authorities must be considered.\r\n61.   Visions of Ecstasy portrays, inter alia, a female character astride the recumbent body of the crucified Christ engaged in an act of an overtly sexual nature (see paragraph 9 above). The national authorities, using powers that are not themselves incompatible with the Convention (see paragraph 57 above), considered that the manner in which such imagery was treated placed the focus of the work \"less on the erotic feelings of the character than on those of the audience, which is the primary function of pornography\" (see paragraph 15 above). They further held that since no attempt was made in the film to explore the meaning of the imagery beyond engaging the viewer in a \"voyeuristic erotic experience\", the public distribution of such a video could outrage and insult the feelings of believing Christians and constitute the criminal offence of blasphemy. This view was reached by both the Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee following a careful consideration of the arguments in defence of his work presented by the applicant in the course of two sets of proceedings. Moreover, it was open to the applicant to challenge the decision of the Appeals Committee in proceedings for judicial review (see paragraph 30 above). Bearing in mind the safeguard of the high threshold of profanation embodied in the definition of the offence of blasphemy under English law as well as the State’s margin of appreciation in this area (see paragraph 58 above), the reasons given to justify the measures taken can be considered as both relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2). Furthermore, having viewed the film for itself, the Court is satisfied that the decisions by the national authorities cannot be said to be arbitrary or excessive.\r\n62.   It was submitted by both the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission that a short experimental video work would reach a smaller audience than a major feature film, such as the one at issue in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (cited above at paragraph 46). The risk that any Christian would unwittingly view the video was therefore substantially reduced and so was the need to impose restrictions on its distribution. Furthermore, this risk could have been reduced further by restricting the distribution of the film to licensed sex shops (see paragraph 23 above). Since the film would have been dispensed in video boxes which would have included a description of its content, only consenting adults would ever have been confronted with it.\r\n63.   The Court notes, however, that it is in the nature of video works that once they become available on the market they can, in practice, be copied, lent, rented, sold and viewed in different homes, thereby easily escaping any form of control by the authorities. In these circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the national authorities, bearing in mind the development of the video industry in the United Kingdom (see paragraph 22 above), to consider that the film could have reached a public to whom it would have caused offence. The use of a box including a warning as to the film’s content (see paragraph 62 above) would have had only limited efficiency given the varied forms of transmission of video works mentioned above. In any event, here too the national authorities are in a better position than the European Court to make an assessment as to the likely impact of such a video, taking into account the difficulties in protecting the public.\r\n64.   It is true that the measures taken by the authorities amounted to a complete ban on the film’s distribution. However, this was an understandable consequence of the opinion of the competent authorities that the distribution of the video would infringe the criminal law and of the refusal of the applicant to amend or cut out the objectionable sequences (see paragraph 13 above). Having reached the conclusion that they did as to the blasphemous content of the film it cannot be said that the authorities overstepped their margin of appreciation.\r\nD. Conclusion\r\n65.   Against this background the national authorities were entitled to consider that the impugned measure was justified as being necessary in a democratic society within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 10 (Art. 10-2). There has therefore been no violation of Article 10 of the Convention (Art. 10).\r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\r\nHolds by seven votes to two that there has been no breach of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10).\r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 25 November 1996.\r\n\r\n\t\tRUDOLF BERNHARDT\r\n\t\tPresident\r\nHERBERT PETZOLD\r\nRegistrar\r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment (a) concurring opinion of Mr Bernhardt; (b) concurring opinion of Mr Pettiti; (c) dissenting opinion of Mr De Meyer; (d) dissenting opinion of Mr Lohmus.\r\nR. B.\r\nH. P.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE BERNHARDT\r\nPersonally, I am not convinced that the video film Visions of Ecstasy should have been banned by the refusal of a classification certificate, and this conviction is, inter alia, based on my impression when seeing the film.  But it is the essence of the national margin of appreciation that, when different opinions are possible and do exist, the international judge should only intervene if the national decision cannot be reasonably justified. I have finally voted with the majority for the following reasons: (1) A prior control and classification of video films is not excluded in this most sensitive area and in view of the dangers involved, especially for young persons and the rights of others. (2) Such a control requires a proper procedure and a careful weighing of the interests involved whenever a classification certificate is refused.  In this respect, the present judgment describes in detail (paragraphs 11-19) the considerations and reasons in the decisions of the British authorities. (3) In respect of the question whether the interference was \"necessary in a democratic society\", I am convinced that the national authorities have a considerable margin of appreciation, and they have made use of it in the present case in a manner acceptable under Convention standards.\r\n \r\n \r\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE PETTITI\r\n(Translation)\r\nI voted with the majority, but for reasons which are substantially different in structure and content from those given in the judgment; I have not followed the reasoning in the Otto-Preminger-Institut case (judgment of 20 September 1994, Series A no. 295-A). The first problem considered concerned the British legislation making blasphemy a criminal offence. Admittedly, it is regrettable that the protection afforded by this legislation does not apply to other religions, for such a limitation makes no sense in 1996 now that we have the United Nations and UNESCO instruments on tolerance.  However, the European Convention on Human Rights does not, on the one hand, prohibit legislation of this type, which is found in a number of member States, and, on the other hand, it leaves scope for review under Article 14 (art. 14).  In the present case no complaint had been made to the European Court under that Article (art. 14). The Court had to decide the case under Article 10 (art. 10). To my mind, the law on blasphemy provides a basis for consideration of the case under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) and cannot automatically justify a ban on distribution. Article 9 (art. 9) is not in issue in the instant case and cannot be invoked.  Certainly the Court rightly based its analysis under Article 10 (art. 10) on the rights of others and did not, as it had done in the Otto-Preminger-Institut judgment combine Articles 9 and 10 (art. 9, art. 10), morals and the rights of others, for which it had been criticised by legal writers. However, the wording adopted by the Chamber in paragraphs 50 and 53 creates, in my opinion, too direct a link between the law of blasphemy and the criteria justifying a ban or restriction on the distribution of video-cassettes.The fact that under the legislation on blasphemy, profanation or defamation may give rise to a prosecution does not in itself justify, under Article 10 (art. 10) of the European Convention, a total ban on the distribution of a book or video. In my view, the Court ought to have made that clear. There can be no automatic response where freedom of expression is concerned. The Court should, I think, have set out in its reasoning the facts that led the Video Appeals Committee - to which the applicant appealed against the determination of the British Board of Film Classification - to prohibit distribution of the video. I consider that the same decision could have been reached under paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) on grounds other than blasphemy, for example the profanation of symbols, including secular ones (the national flag) or jeopardising or prejudicing public order (but not for the benefit of a religious majority in the territory concerned). The reasoning should, in my opinion have been expressed in terms both of religious beliefs and of philosophical convictions.  It is only in paragraph 53 of the judgment that the words \"any other\" are cited. Profanation and serious attacks on the deeply held feelings of others or on religious or secular ideals can be relied on under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) in addition to blasphemy. What was particularly shocking in the Wingrove case was the combination of an ostensibly philosophical message and wholly irrelevant obscene or pornographic images. In this case, the use of obscenity for commercial ends may justify restrictions under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2); but the use of a figure of symbolic value as a great thinker in the history of mankind (such as Moses, Dante or Tolstoy) in a portrayal which seriously offends the deeply held feelings of those who respect their works or thought may, in some cases, justify judicial supervision so that the public can be alerted through the reporting of court decisions. But the possibility of prosecution does not suffice to make a total ban legitimate.  That question has been raised recently: can a breach of rules of professional conduct (medical confidentiality) in itself justify a total ban on a book? Mr Wingrove’s own argument and the contradictions it contained could even have been used to supplement the Court’s reasoning. In his application he claimed that intellectual works should be protected against censorship on exclusively moral or religious grounds.  In an article which is not reproduced in the video Mr Wingrove indicated that he was seeking to interpret St Teresa’s writings explaining her ecstasies.  In his submission, they amounted practically to a Voltairean work or one having anti-religious connotations.  The film is quite different.  Mr Wingrove did not even agree to cut (which he was entitled to do as the film-maker) the \"simulated copulation\" scene which was quite unnecessary, even in the context of the film.  Indeed, he acknowledged that as the video stood, it could have been called Gay Nuns in Bondage, like a pornographic film (see the Commission’s report, decision on admissibility, p. 32). The use of the word \"ecstasy\" in the title was a source of ambiguity, as much for people interested in literary works as for those interested in pornography. The sale in hypermarkets and supermarkets of videos inciting pornographic or obscene behaviour is even more dangerous than the sale of books, as it is more difficult to ensure that the public are protected. The recent world-wide conference in Stockholm on the protection of children highlighted the harmful social consequences of distributing millions of copies of obscene or pornographic videos to the public without even minimal checking of their identification marks. Disguising content is a commercial technique that is used to circumvent bans (for example, videos for paedophiles that use adolescent girls, who have only just attained their majority, dressed up as little girls). Admittedly, before it was edited, Mr Wingrove’s film was presented as having literary rather than obscene ambitions, but its maker chose not to dispel the ambiguity he had created.  Nor did he seek judicial review, as it was open to him to do, of the Video Appeals Committee’s dismissal of his appeal against the Board of Film Classification’s refusal to grant a classification certificate. It is true that section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984 contains a variety of provisions regulating the grant and use of certificates, ranging from outright bans to restrictions on viewing, identification requirements (in sales centres and on the cover) or measures to protect minors. On this point, British and North American case-law, particularly in Canada, contains a wealth of definitions of the boundaries between literature, obscenity and pornography (see the Revue du Barreau du Québec and the Supreme Court’s case-law review). The majority of the Video Appeals Committee took the view that the imagery led not to a religious perception, but to a perverse one, the ecstasy being furthermore of a perverse kind. That analysis was in conformity with the approach of the House of Lords, which moreover did not discuss the author’s intention with respect to the moral element of the offence.  The Board’s Director said that it would have taken just the same stance in respect of a film that was contemptuous of Mohammed or Buddha. The decision not to grant a certificate might possibly have been justifiable and justified if, instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had been a video showing, for example, the anti-clerical Voltaire having sexual relations with some prince or king.  In such a case, the decision of the European Court might well have been similar to that in the Wingrove case.  The rights of others under Article 10 para. 2 (art. 10-2) cannot be restricted solely to the protection of the rights of others in a single category of religious believers or philosophers, or a majority of them. The Court was quite right to base its decision on the protection of the rights of others pursuant to Article 10 (art. 10), but to my mind it could have done so on broader grounds, inspired to a greater extent by the concern to protect the context of religious beliefs \"or any other\", as is rightly pointed out in paragraph 53 of the judgment. In the difficult balancing exercise that has to be carried out in these situations where religious and philosophical sensibilities are confronted by freedom of expression, it is important that the inspiration provided by the European Convention and its interpretation should be based both on pluralism and a sense of values.\r\n\r\n  Judgment of 26 November 1991, Series A no. 216, p. 46\r\n  Section 7 of the Video Recordings Act 1984\r\n  Section 4 of the Act\r\n  See paragraph 29 of the present judgment\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER\r\n1.   This was a pure case of prior restraint, a form of interference which is, in my view, unacceptable in the field of freedom of expression. What I have written on that subject, with four other judges, in the case of Observer and Guardian v. the United Kingdom  applies not only to the press, but also, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of expression, including video works.\r\n2.   It is quite legitimate that those wishing to supply video works be obliged to obtain from some administrative authority a classification certificate stating whether the works concerned may be supplied to the general public or only to persons who have attained a specified age, and whether, in the latter case, they are to be supplied only in certain places .\r\nOf course, anything so decided by such authority needs reasonable justification and must not be arbitrary.  It must, if contested, be subject to judicial review, and it must not have the effect of preventing the courts from deciding, as the case may be, whether the work concerned deserves, or does not deserve, any sanction under existing law.\r\n3.   Under the system established by the Video Recordings Act 1984 the British Board of Film Classification and the Video Appeals Committee may determine that certain video works are not suitable for being classified in any of its three categories , and they can thus ban them absolutely ab initio. This was indeed what actually happened in respect of the piece in issue in the present case. It certainly goes too far. 4. To the extent that the criminal law of blasphemy might have been infringed by the applicant, I would observe that the necessity of such laws is very much open to question. I would rather join Mr Patten’s remark that for the faithful \"the strength of their own belief is the best armour against mockers and blasphemers\" .\r\n \r\n \r\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE LOHMUS\r\n1.   I am unable to agree with the conclusion of the majority that the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression was \"necessary in a democratic society\". 2. The British Board of Film Classification and the five-member panel of the VAC took the view that the applicant would commit an offence of blasphemy if his video work Visions of Ecstasy were to be distributed (see paragraph 20 of the judgment). 3. In cases of prior restraint (censorship) there is interference by the authorities with freedom of expression even though the members of the society whose feelings they seek to protect have not called for such interference. The interference is based on the opinion of the authorities that they understand correctly the feelings they claim to protect.  The actual opinion of believers remains unknown.  I think that this is why we cannot conclude that the interference corresponded to a \"pressing social need\". 4. The law of blasphemy only protects the Christian religion and, more specifically, the established Church of England (see paragraph 28 of the judgment).  The aim of the interference was therefore to protect the Christian faith alone and not other beliefs. This in itself raises the question whether the interference was \"necessary in a democratic society\". 5. As the Court has consistently held, the guarantees enshrined in Article 10 (art. 10) apply not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive, but also to those that shock or disturb. Artistic impressions are often conveyed through images and situations which may shock or disturb the feelings of a person of average sensitivity. In my view, the makers of the film in issue did not exceed the reasonable limit beyond which it can be said that objects of religious veneration have been reviled or ridiculed. 6. The majority has found that in the field of morals the national authorities have a wide margin of appreciation.  As in that field, \"there is no uniform European conception of the requirements of ‘the protection of the rights of others’ in relation to attacks on their religious convictions\" (see paragraph 58 of the judgment). The Court makes distinctions within Article 10 (art. 10) when applying its doctrine on the States’ margin of appreciation.

GREECE\r\n\r\n(Application no. 18877/91)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASBOURG\r\n\r\n15 November 1996 \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the case of Ahmet Sadik v. Greece , \r\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges: \r\n\tMr R. RYSSDAL, President, \r\n\tMr N. VALTICOS, \r\n\tMr S.K. MARTENS, \r\n\tMr I. FOIGHEL, \r\n\tMr J.M. MORENILLA, \r\n\tSir John FREELAND, \r\n\tMr A.B. BAKA, \r\n\tMr B. REPIK, \r\n\tMr K. JUNGWIERT, \r\nand also of Mr H. PETZOLD, Registrar, and Mr P.J. MAHONEY, Deputy Registrar, \r\nHaving deliberated in private on 30 March, 30 August and 25 October 1996, \r\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last mentioned date: \r\nPROCEDURE \r\n1.   The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 29 May 1995 and by the Government of the Hellenic Republic (\"the Government\") on 4 July 1995, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 para. 1 and Article 47 of the Convention (art. 32-1, art. 47). It originated in an application (no. 18877/91) against Greece lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a Greek national, Mr Sadik Ahmet Sadik, on 11 July 1991. The applicant died on 24 July 1995; his wife, Mrs Isik Ahmet, and his two children, Mr Levent Ahmet and Miss Funda Ahmet, stated that they wished to continue the proceedings. \r\nThe Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Greece recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46); the Government's application referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48). The object of the request and of the application was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10). \r\n\r\n  The case is numbered 46/1995/552/638. The first number is the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court in the relevant year (second number). The last two numbers indicate the case's position on the list of cases referred to the Court since its creation and on the list of the corresponding originating applications to the Commission.\r\n  Rules A apply to all cases referred to the Court before the entry into force of Protocol No. 9 (P9) (1 October 1994) and thereafter only to cases concerning States not bound by that Protocol (P9). They correspond to the Rules that came into force on 1 January 1983, as amended several times subsequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.   In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30). \r\n3.   The Chamber to be constituted included ex officio Mr N. Valticos, the elected judge of Greek nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)). On 8 June 1995, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other seven members, namely Mr S.K. Martens, Mr I. Foighel, Mr J.M. Morenilla, Mr F. Bigi, Sir John Freeland, Mr B. Repik and Mr K. Jungwiert (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 para. 4) (art. 43). Subsequently Mr A.B. Baka, substitute judge, replaced Mr Bigi, who had died (Rules 21 para. 4 and 22 para. 1). \r\nOn 25 August 1995 the Registrar was informed of the applicant's death and later that his widow and children wanted the proceedings to continue and wished to participate in them, retaining the applicant's lawyer as their representative. For practical reasons, Mr Ahmet Sadik will continue to be referred to in this judgment as \"the applicant\", although Mrs Isik Ahmet and her children are now to be regarded as having this status (see the Vocaturo v. Italy judgment of 24 May 1991, Series A no. 206-C, p. 29, para. 2). \r\n4.   As President of the Chamber (Rule 21 para. 5), Mr Ryssdal, acting through the Registrar, consulted the Agent of the Government, the applicant's lawyer and the Delegate of the Commission on the organisation of the proceedings (Rules 37 para. 1 and 38). The applicant's memorial was received at the registry on 10 January 1996 and the Government's on 11 January. On 30 January the Government filed a number of documents, having been given leave to do so by the President on 14 December 1995. On 12 February the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate of the Commission did not intend to submit any written observations. \r\nBy a letter received on 22 December 1995 Rights International, an American non-governmental organisation, sought leave to submit written observations under Rule 37 para. 2. On 25 January 1996 the President decided not to give it leave to do so. \r\nOn 6 March 1996, after the time-limit for the submission of written observations by those appearing before the Court had expired, the applicant's lawyer filed at the registry a report by Helsinki Watch published in 1992 following a fact-finding mission carried out by that organisation in Western Thrace. At its preparatory meeting on 27 March 1996 the Court decided to admit this document and the President gave the Government leave to reply, which they did on 30 April 1996. \r\n5.   In accordance with the President's decision, the hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 27 March 1996. The Court had held a preparatory meeting beforehand. \r\nThere appeared before the Court: \r\n(a) for the Government  \r\nMr V. KONDOLAIMOS, Adviser, \r\nLegal Council of State,\tDelegate of the Agent,\r\nMr D. SPINELIS, Lecturer, Athens University,  \r\nMrs V. PELEKOU, Legal Assistant, \r\nLegal Council of State,  \r\nMrs M. VONDIKAKI-TELALIAN, Adviser, \r\nLegal Service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\tCounsel;\r\n(b) for the Commission  \r\nMr B. CONFORTI,\tDelegate;\r\n(c) for the applicant  \r\nMr T. AKILLIOGLU, avukat (lawyer) at the Ankara Bar \r\nand university lecturer,\tCounsel.\r\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr Conforti, Mr Akillioglu, Mr Kondolaimos, Mr Spinelis and Mrs Pelekou. The Government's representative produced certain documents at the hearing, having been invited to do so by the Court. \r\nAS TO THE FACTS \r\nI.   CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE \r\n6.   Mr Ahmet Sadik, a Greek national of the Muslim faith, was born in 1949 and lived in Komotini (Western Thrace). He was a doctor, publisher of the weekly newspaper Güven (\"Trust\") and a member of the Greek Parliament. He died on 24 July 1995 in a road accident near Komotini.   \r\nA. The background to the case \r\n7.   The applicant was the sole candidate of the political party Güven - representing part of the Muslim population of Western Thrace - to win a seat in the parliamentary election of June 1989. As no government emerged from that election, a fresh poll was planned for November 1989 in which the applicant intended to stand as a candidate. \r\n8.   On various dates between 16 October and 17 November 1989 Mr Ahmet Sadik published in the newspaper Güven and circulated in the region a number of communiqués, including the following:\r\n\"TO THE TURCO-MUSLIM ELECTORATE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF RODOPI \r\nIn response to the repeated requests of the Turco-Muslim electorate of the department of Rodopi, we, journalist Molla ismail (of Rodopi), Dr Sadik Ahmet and theologian ibrahim Serif, have decided to stand in the general election of 5 November as members of the independent Güven list. The Turkish community of Western Thrace, especially since 1974, has been through some unhappy experiences at the hands of political parties. At the elections of 18 June, in an upsurge of unity, it placed its trust in the independent Güven list. It asserted its identity and took its destiny into its own hands by electing a member of that list to represent it in Parliament. For the elections of 5 November it is equally determined to send to Parliament a representative who enjoys its trust. \r\nAfter the historic victory won on 18 June the Turkish electors of the department of Rodopi never again wish to return to the old parties and live once more the days when they were despondent and crushed. \r\nMoreover, we suffer when we observe the manoeuvres of the other parties, who, in order to win the precious Turco-Muslim vote in Western Thrace, are playing on the fears of the people in our towns and villages. Some who seem to be of our own kind still dare, under the pretext of defending the rights of the Turco-Muslim community in Western Thrace, to call for the votes of our honest, fair-minded fellow citizens. It is painful to see that these adventurers can still walk abroad among us. The only thing the members of the Turco-Muslim community of Western Thrace want is to live in dignity in the country where they were born and have grown up. No force will halt their just and legitimate struggle. \r\nWe place all our trust in God first of all, but also in the honest and conscientious Turco-Muslim electorate, who believe in our cause. The Turkish electorate of the department of Rodopi, whose motto is 'one for all and all for one' will express their trust in Güven on 5 November and overcome all their adversaries with honour and respect. ...\" \r\nThe applicant was convicted of an offence on the basis of the above article, a Greek translation of which was read out at his trial in the Rodopi Criminal Court and in the Patras Court of Appeal (see paragraphs 9, 10 and 15 below). \r\nIn another communiqué he wrote:\r\n\"YOUNG PEOPLE! SHOULDER YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES \r\nON 5 NOVEMBER THE INNOCENT YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFERING SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR BIRTH IN WESTERN THRACE WILL AT LAST BE ABLE TO SAY 'NO' TO THE POLITICAL PARTIES WHO ARE MAKING THEM LIVE AN INHUMAN LIFE \r\nYOUNG PEOPLE! UNITY IS STRENGTH! STICK TOGETHER! YOUR VOTE IS AS PRECIOUS AS YOUR HONOUR, BE CAREFUL HOW YOU CAST IT! \r\nTHE YOUNG TURKS OF WESTERN THRACE, WHOSE SLOGAN IS 'WE WANT RIGHTS, NOT CHARITY' ARE GOING TO ENFORCE RESPECT FOR THEIR RIGHTS \r\nYOUNG TURK OF WESTERN THRACE \r\nIn this community of 150 thousand Turco-Muslims of Western Thrace the highest duty, one which will fill you with honour and pride, falls to you. The date of the fresh general election, 5 November, is approaching. \r\nFor 25 to 30 years you have been affected most by the pressure, discrimination and injustice inflicted on the Turkish community of Western Thrace by the leaders who have followed each other at the head of this country. \r\nYou have breathed in the fumes of injustice and discrimination since birth. \r\nYour innocent childhood passed by in injustice. You were not able to shout out to the world 'I am a Turkish child'. \r\nIn our world, where education and training are so highly developed, your schooling was cut short. You did not even have a schoolbook when ethnic-Greek children were getting a modern education and taking advantage of the cultural and technological developments of their time. \r\nYou have the necessary intelligence to become a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer ... but this country which you call 'my homeland' has shut the door of study in your face. You have grown up and become an adult in the midst of these injustices by the law of nature. Because no one could prevent you growing up. Perhaps you are also now married and a father, but you have no home for your dear wife and the children you love. You have just completed your military service but, in this country that you call 'my homeland', the right to buy or build a house is denied you. \r\nAs your access to higher education was barred, you learned a trade, although this meant putting up with the constant annoying remarks of your 'Christian boss' [Çorbaci] down through the years. You became a repairer of engines, exhaust pipes or tyres ..., but you still have to fill the pockets of your Christian boss, because you do not have the right to open your own workshop. \r\nWhen you were born you received your name during the call to prayer; your name appears in the district council's register as Ahmet, Mehmet ... But in your place of work your boss insists on calling you 'Taki, Maki, Saki ...' \r\nWith the enthusiasm of youth you leap on a tractor and work in the fields day and night. You would like to drive past in front of your friends on this tractor, but you can't. \r\nBecause you are not even thought worthy of permission to use the tractor. You are almost obliged to work your own land by stealth. After working all year long and saving up a bit of money you would like to go for a trip or to travel abroad. But you're uneasy about going away. You are tormented by doubts. You wonder if you'll lose your nationality when you return or have to surrender your passport when you leave. \r\nYOUNG PEOPLE OF WESTERN THRACE! \r\nYou young people who came into the world in the midst of all this injustice and for whom a humiliating existence has been mapped out, your day has come! \r\nIn the elections of 5 November, teach all those who would lock you into this injustice an unforgettable lesson. \r\nNOBODY DOUBTS THAT YOU WILL GIVE YOUR FULL SUPPORT TO THE INDEPENDENT LIST and in so doing prove that you would rather die than abandon your national and religious roots! \r\nHere and now you must set up CAMPAIGN COMMITTEES in your district or village and make sure that your parents and grandparents are not deceived! \r\nOn the day of the elections, up till the time when all the votes have been counted, make sure that all the votes are not wasted by remaining either next to the ballot boxes or outside the polling station. Do not forget for a single second that your vote is as precious as your honour! \r\nTHE TURKISH COMMUNITY OF WESTERN THRACE TRUSTS YOU AND IS PROUD OF YOU. \r\nLONG LIVE THE TURKISH AND MUSLIM YOUTH OF WESTERN THRACE!\" \r\n9.   The applicant was then accused of contravening Articles 162 and 192 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 20 below). On 18 December 1989 the public prosecutor attached to the Rodopi Criminal Court summoned him to appear in that court on 25 January 1990 to stand trial on the following charges:\r\n\"[In the second half of] the month of October 1989, in the town of Komotini, \r\n(1) by false information and defamatory declarations about certain candidates, [Mr Ahmet Sadik] deceived the electors in order to induce them to change the way they intended to vote; in particular, he wrote and circulated in the town of Komotini and other places in the department of Rodopi a declaration in the Turkish language ... in which he asserted that the Muslim electors of the department of Rodopi were living every day - that is in the period preceding the general election of 5 November 1989 - in an anarchic climate (of terror) fostered by the candidates of the other political parties ... who were going round the different villages of the department of Rodopi trying to win the votes of the Muslim electors ... \r\n(2) at the same time and in the same place he contravened Article 192 of the Criminal Code ...; in particular he wrote and circulated the above-mentioned declaration in which there were frequent repetitions of the words 'Turk', 'Turkish Muslim', 'Turkish Muslim minority of Western Thrace' and 'Turkish community', used to designate the Muslim minority in Thrace; by describing the Muslim minority as 'Turkish' and by calling the Muslims 'Turks' rather than 'Greeks', he provoked and incited the citizens to sow discord among themselves (particularly on the Muslim side) and between them and the other citizens of Komotini, and thus disturbed the public peace ... \r\nConsequently, he has contravened Articles ... 162 and 192 of the Criminal Code.\" \r\nA second summons, of the same date, directed the applicant to appear before the same court on 8 February 1990 to answer the following charge: \r\n\"On 17 November 1989 in the town of Komotini and in other places in the department of Rodopi he contravened Article 192 of the Criminal Code ... In particular, he published in the newspaper Güven of 17 November 1989 a declaration signed by him (the accused) in which he falsely alleged the existence of discrimination against, and oppression of, the Muslims of Thrace by the Greek administrative authorities, and of injustices committed to their detriment. Lastly, by describing the Muslim minority of Thrace as the 'Turkish minority' rather than the 'Greek minority of Muslim faith', he provoked and incited the citizens, mainly on the Muslim side, to reciprocal discord and thus disturbed the public peace of the citizens of Thrace. \r\nConsequently, he has contravened Articles ... and 192 of the Criminal Code.\"   \r\nB. The proceedings in the Rodopi Criminal Court \r\n10.   On 25 January 1990 Mr Ahmet Sadik and his co-defendant appeared in the Rodopi Criminal Court. While the witnesses were being questioned their lawyers challenged one of the court's judges on account of the animosity he had shown towards the accused and the way he was asking the questions. After deliberating, the court dismissed the challenge, holding that the questions asked by the judge concerned did not go beyond the scope of the bill of indictment and were intended as an objective means of revealing the truth in the case under consideration. The defence lawyers then withdrew from the case and their clients stated that they did not want any other lawyer to be appointed. They conducted their own defence and denied committing the offence charged. In particular, the applicant said that his intention in the articles in issue had only been to condemn the oppression of the Muslim minority by the State and to draw attention to the problems which members of that minority encountered in their dealings with the administrative authorities. He pointed out that the term \"Turkish\" had been used for a long time not only in the press but also by the administrative and judicial authorities. Lastly, he asserted that the presence of a crowd which had gathered outside the court was not due to the articles in issue but to the fact that the trial was being held and the fact that the Muslims' ethnic identity was still being denied. \r\n11.   On 26 January 1990 the court acquitted the applicant and his co defendant of electoral deception, but found them guilty of disturbing the citizens' peace. \r\nThe court found that the accused, as the candidates of an independent party in the elections of 5 November 1989, had jointly written in the Turkish language a declaration which they had circulated in the town of Komotini and other places in Rodopi and in which the terms \"Turk\", \"Turkish Muslim\", \"Turco-Muslim minority of Western Thrace\" and \"Turkish community\" repeatedly appeared. By describing the Greek Muslims of Komotini and the department of Rodopi as Turks rather than Greeks, they had intended, by appealing to the feelings, minds and will of the Greek citizens of the Muslim minority, to instil and implant in their hearts the seeds of discord, hatred and hostility towards the Christian Greeks of Komotini and the department of Rodopi, to provoke and incite the citizens of the two communities to commit acts of violence and to sow discord between themselves and thus disturb, as they had moreover succeeded in doing, the public peace and the peaceful and harmonious co existence that had obtained for centuries between the citizens of the two Greek communities (the Christian and the Muslim). \r\nThe court sentenced Mr Ahmet Sadik to eighteen months' imprisonment, not commutable into a fine. It held that such a penalty would not be sufficient, in view of the applicant's character and the circumstances of the case, to dissuade him from committing other offences. Furthermore, his refusal to express regret and the way he had persisted during the trial in making separatist speeches showed that he was particularly dangerous. Any appeal he might lodge should therefore not have suspensive effect as it was probable that he would evade justice by absconding to Turkey. Enforcement of the sentence until such time as the appeal court had given judgment would not cause either the applicant or his family excessive and irreparable prejudice. \r\n12.   The applicant remained in detention from 26 January to 30 March 1990. His candidacy in the elections of November 1989 was annulled for technical reasons.   \r\nC. The incidents of 29 January 1990 in Komotini \r\n13.   On 29 January 1990 violence broke out in Komotini, in the course of which many shops were damaged. A Muslim killed a Christian in a hospital in the town. \r\n14.   For the Muslim minority of Western Thrace the date was significant as the anniversary of events which had taken place two years before, in 1988. In November 1987 the Court of Cassation had forbidden the minority's youth and primary school teacher associations to describe themselves as \"Turkish\". The Court of Cassation's judgment brought to a close a series of actions brought in 1984 by the prefects of Rodopi and Xanthi in order to obtain the dissolution of the \"Komotini Union of Turkish Youth\", the \"Turkish Primary Teachers' Union of Western Thrace\" and the \"Xanthi Turkish Union\". Accordingly, in January 1988, the Muslim minority of Western Thrace decided to organise a demonstration in front of the prefecture to express their disapproval of the above judgment. Although the demonstration had been banned by the police, it did in the end take place, but matters got out of hand and violent clashes took place in the town of Komotini.   \r\nD. The proceedings in the Patras Court of Appeal \r\n15.   On 27 January 1990 the applicant appealed against the judgment of the Rodopi Criminal Court. The case was referred to the Patras Court of Appeal for reasons having to do with the maintenance of order and public safety (Articles 136 (c) and 137 para. 1 (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure). \r\nOn 30 March 1990 the Patras Court of Appeal upheld the Criminal Court's judgment, giving the following reasons:\r\n\"The following facts have been established by the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution and the defence examined under oath during the trial before this Court and by the documents read out and the arguments put forward by the accused in his defence. As candidates on an independent list in the general election of 5 November 1989 in Komotini, the accused wrote, between 10 and 20 October 1989, a pamphlet printed in Turkish which they distributed in the town of Komotini and other places in the department of Rodopi and in which the terms 'Turks', 'Turkish Muslims', 'Turkish Muslim minority of Western Thrace' and 'Turkish community' repeatedly appeared. In this manner the accused deliberately set out to describe as 'Turks\" the Greek citizens of Muslim faith, although they knew that under the Treaty of Lausanne only a Muslim minority, not a Turkish minority, has been recognised in the region of Western Thrace. Nevertheless, by the above-mentioned act, which was an appeal to the feelings, minds and will of the Greek citizens of the Muslim minority, the accused deliberately sought to instil and implant in their hearts the seeds of discord, hatred and hostility towards the Christian Greeks who lived in the same region. In this manner they succeeded in provoking and inciting the citizens to mutual discord, a further consequence of which was disturbance of the public peace. All the foregoing has been corroborated by the prosecution witnesses Athanasios Kamarakis, Stylianos Bletsas, Syrmatoula Lantzouraki and Konstantinos Tsetlakas, who, living in Komotini, had direct knowledge of these facts. They stated that, because of the distribution of the pamphlet in question, the public peace among the citizens of the town of Komotini was seriously disturbed, so that in a short space of time acts of violence were committed between Christians and Muslims. The accused's assertion that what they sought to achieve through the pamphlet in question was only to win the support of the electors of the Greek Muslim population is not convincing because, if that had been the case, they could have achieved their aim by any other suitable method without referring to Greek Muslims in the pamphlet in question as 'Turks', even though they knew that a Turkish minority is not recognised in Greek Thrace and that if they attempted to raise such an issue in such a sensitive region, the peace between Christian and Muslim Greeks would certainly be disturbed, which was indeed what actually happened. Consequently, the accused are declared guilty of the above-mentioned offence, as described analytically in the operative provisions of this judgment. Nevertheless, the Court will take into consideration the extenuating circumstance that before committing the offence the accused had always led blameless private, family, professional and social lives.\" \r\nLastly, the Court of Appeal reduced Mr Ahmet Sadik's prison sentence to fifteen months and commuted it to a fine of 1,000 drachmas (GRD) per day. \r\n16.   On 8 April 1990, after his release, the applicant was re-elected to the Greek Parliament.   \r\nE. The proceedings in the Court of Cassation \r\n17.   On 24 October 1990 the applicant appealed on points of law. He maintained that the charges against him were vague and that the courts below should have dismissed the prosecution case. He also alleged that the Patras Court of Appeal had not given sufficient reasons for its decision, as Greek legislation required. In particular, he argued that the Court of Appeal had not made it clear why the use of the noun \"Turk\" or the adjective \"Turkish\" was per se likely to create a climate of hatred or disturb public order. Lastly, he complained that the judgment gave no specific example of events which had actually occurred towards the end of October 1989 and which could be said to have disturbed public peace. \r\n18.   On 15 February 1991 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on the following grounds:\r\n\"... Article 192, which was adopted for the protection of public order and to enable a State based on the rule of law to deal with the kind of tension which the democratic legal order ... cannot tolerate, establishes, as do Articles 190 and 191, the serious offence of 'disturbing the citizens' peace'. The objective element of this offence - according to the Article mentioned - consists in provoking or inciting the citizens, publicly and in any manner whatsoever (whether orally or in writing), to commit acts of violence or to sow discord among themselves, or aversion and hate, thus disturbing the public peace, that is to say society's confidence in peaceful order. \r\nThe subjective element of the offence is the offender's mens rea, which means that he must have acted knowingly and with the intent to provoke or incite the citizens to commit acts of violence or to sow discord among themselves, thus disturbing the public peace. \r\n... \r\nIn the instant case ... the Patras Court of Appeal ... found ... that the appellants, who were independent candidates in Komotini in the general election of 5 November 1989, had jointly written towards the end of October 1989 a declaration in the Turkish language, which they circulated in the town of Komotini and other places in the department of Rodopi and in which the terms 'Turk', 'Turkish Muslim', 'Turco-Muslim minority of Western Thrace' and 'Turkish community' repeatedly appeared. In this manner the appellants had deliberately attempted to describe as 'Turks' the Greek Muslims of Southern Rodopi, although they knew that the Treaty of Lausanne recognised only the existence in that region of a Muslim (religious) minority, not a Turkish minority. Nevertheless, the appellants, in appealing to the feelings, minds and will of the Greek citizens of the Muslim minority, had deliberately set out to instil and implant in their hearts the seeds of discord, hate and hostility towards the Christian Greeks who live in the same region. They had thus succeeded in provoking and sowing discord among the citizens, which disturbed the peace of the citizens of Komotini to such an extent that, in a short space of time, acts of violence were committed between Christians and Muslims in that town. Moreover, they knew that there was no Turkish minority in Western Thrace and that their conduct would disturb the public peace between Christian and Muslim Greeks. \r\n... \r\nBy its reasoning the Court of Appeal can be seen to have set out in the impugned judgment the specific, detailed grounds required by Article 93 para. 3 of the Constitution and Article 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, since it gave a full and clear account therein, without contradicting itself, of the facts of the case as established at the trial, which constitute the objective and subjective elements of the above-mentioned offence ... \r\nMore particularly, there is no contradiction between the reasons and the operative provisions ..., since provoking and sowing discord, thus disturbing the public peace, are sufficient to make out the objective element of the offence for which they were sentenced. Mentioning in the reasons that acts of violence had been committed, while not necessary to support the operative provisions, was not however in contradiction with those provisions, regard being had to the fact that discord is the psychological condition for an act of violence, which is the higher level of discord ... \r\nLastly, the appellants' mens rea is inherent in the commission of the acts that constitute the offence, which show that they acted deliberately, knowing that they were disturbing the public peace ...\" \r\nII.   RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW   \r\nA. The Constitution \r\n19.   The following provisions of the 1975 Constitution are relevant:      \r\nArticle 14 para. 1 \r\n\"Every person may express and propagate his thoughts orally, in writing and through the press in compliance with the laws of the State.\"      \r\nArticle 28 para. 1 \r\n\"The generally acknowledged rules of international law, as well as international Conventions as of the time they are sanctioned by law and become operative according to the terms therein, shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law and shall prevail over any contrary provision of the law. The rules of international law and of international Conventions shall be applicable to aliens only under the condition of reciprocity.\"   \r\nB. The Criminal Code \r\n20.   The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are worded as follows:\r\n\"Electoral deception    \r\nArticle 162 \r\nIt shall be an offence, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment and a fine, to deceive an elector through false information or defamatory declarations about an electoral candidate, or by any other means, either in order to prevent him from exercing his right to vote or in order to influence his voting intentions ...\"   \r\n\"Disturbing the public peace    \r\nArticle 189 \r\n1. It shall be an offence, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment, to participate in a gathering of persons ... committing acts of violence against people or property or forcibly entering houses belonging to others, dwellings or other buildings. \r\n2. Incitement to commit the offence or the commission of acts of violence shall be punished by not less than three months' imprisonment. \r\n3. These penalties shall be imposed if the conduct concerned is not punished more severely pursuant to another provision.\"   \"Disturbing the citizens' peace    \r\nArticle 190 \r\nIt shall be an offence, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment, to provoke anxiety or terror among the citizens by threatening the commission of criminal offences.      \r\nArticle 191 para. 1 \r\nIt shall be an offence, punishable by not less than three months' imprisonment and a fine, to spread by any means false information or rumours calculated to provoke anxiety or fear among the citizens or to undermine confidence in the State ... or to perturb the country's international relations. If the offence is repeated by way of the press, the offender shall be punished by not less than six months' imprisonment and a fine of not less than two hundred thousand drachmas.    \r\nArticle 192 \r\nIt shall be an offence, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment, save where another provision lays down a harsher penalty, to provoke or incite the citizens, publicly and in any manner whatsoever, to commit acts of violence or sow discord among themselves, thus disturbing the public peace.\" \r\nPROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSION \r\n21.   Mr Ahmet Sadik applied to the Commission on 11 July 1991. He alleged violations of Article 5 paras. 1, 3 and 4; Article 6 para. 1; Article 6 paras. 1, 2 and 3 taken in conjunction with Article 14; Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention (art. 5-1, art. 5-3, art. 5-4, art. 6-1, art. 14+6-1, art. 14+6-2, art. 14+6-3, art. 9, art. 10, art. 11, art. 14) and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-3). \r\n22.   On 8 July 1994 the Commission declared the application (no. 18877/91) admissible in so far as it concerned the complaints under Articles 9, 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention (art. 9, art. 10, art. 11, art. 14), while expressing the opinion that the main issue raised was the question whether there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10), and declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. In its report of 4 April 1995 (Article 31) (art. 31) it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). The full text of the Commission's opinion is reproduced as an annex to this judgment . \r\n\r\n  For practical reasons this annex will appear only with the printed version of the judgment (in Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V), but a copy of the Commission's report is obtainable from the registry.\r\n\r\nFINAL SUBMISSIONS TO THE COURT BY THE GOVERNMENT \r\n23.   In their memorial the Government argued in conclusion:\r\n\"1. The petition of the applicant late Ahmet Sadik based on a complaint concerning the invoked violation of Article 10 (art. 10) is not transferable to his heirs and does not present a general interest; and therefore should be considered and declared inadmissible. \r\n2. Furthermore, on a subsidiary basis, the petition should be declared inadmissible according to Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26), also because the national remedies have not been exhausted, since the argument that the application of article 192 of the Greek Penal Code in the concrete case constituted a violation of the freedom of expression of the applicant has not been invoked before the national courts. \r\n3. Finally, also on a subsidiary basis, considering all the relevant circumstances, the conviction of the late applicant was provided by law, was pursuing a legitimate aim, was necessary in a democratic society and proportionate; therefore it did not constitute a violation of Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10). \r\n4. Also on a last subsidiary basis, if the Court would find that Greece is in breach of Article 10 (art. 10), the Greek Government submits that in view of Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50) the only amount which could be claimed by the heirs of the late applicant would be the proven real and necessary disbursements, which they incurred during the proceedings before the Commission and the Court.\" \r\nAS TO THE LAW \r\nI.   PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION \r\n24.   The Government contested the right of the applicant's widow and children to continue before the Court the proceedings he had instituted. Relying on the Commission's case-law on the question, they submitted that the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) was so closely and directly bound up with the deceased applicant's person that his heirs could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable them to continue the proceedings in his stead. Moreover, the applicant's case was an isolated one which raised no question of general interest. \r\n25.   The lawyer of the deceased applicant's heirs invoked, in addition to his clients' pecuniary interest, their personal interest in continuing the proceedings, if only in order to be informed whether they were \"members of the Greek minority of Muslim faith\" or simply \"members of the Turkish community\". \r\nIn addition, he maintained that the interest of the present proceedings went well beyond the individual case of Mr Ahmet Sadik since they concerned the name and cultural identity of an entire minority. In support of that argument he referred to the very terms of the Government's application bringing the case before the Court, in which they had declared: \"the case concerns important national issues and also raises complex legal problems, since it affects the Muslim minority in Western Thrace\". \r\n26.   The Court notes, firstly, that the applicant was convicted by the Greek courts of disturbing, through his writings, the public peace and the peace of the citizens of Western Thrace. Without prejudice to its decision on the objection relating to non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, the Court considers that Mr Ahmet Sadik's widow and children have a legitimate moral interest in obtaining a ruling that his conviction infringed the right to freedom of expression which he relied on before the Convention institutions. \r\nFurthermore, it notes that the applicant was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment, commutable to a fine of GRD 1,000 per day of detention, which sum he paid. Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the applicant's heirs also have a definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50). \r\nThe Court accordingly finds that Mrs Isik Ahmet and her two children, Mr Levent Ahmet and Miss Funda Ahmet, have standing to continue the present proceedings in the applicant's stead. \r\nII.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTION \r\n27.   The Government submitted that Mr Ahmet Sadik had not exhausted domestic remedies, not having raised before the national courts, even in substance, the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10). \r\nThey asserted that neither the applicant nor his lawyers had alleged at any stage of the proceedings in the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal - even indirectly or in abstract terms - any infringement whatsoever of the right to freedom of expression. The only reason why, in the Court of Cassation, the applicant had asserted his right to use the term \"Turkish\" to designate the Muslims of Western Thrace had been to prove that the act he had committed was not sufficient to make out the objective element of the offence defined in Article 192 of the Criminal Code. In addition, the Court of Cassation could not consider of its own motion the possibility of an infringement of the right to freedom of expression. While it fell to that court to review the constitutionality of a legislative provision proprio motu, it could not - in the absence of an express application to this effect by the parties - consider whether the provision concerned had been applied to the facts of the case before it in a manner compatible with the Constitution. \r\n28.   The applicant acknowledged that he had not explicitly referred to Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) in the Greek courts, but asserted that in his appeal on points of law he had nevertheless laid stress on the vagueness of the charges preferred against him and the unclear formulation of the reasons for the Court of Appeal's judgment. Even supposing that he had not invoked his right to freedom of expression in substance in the Greek courts, judges were under a duty to determine of their own motion where the dividing line between the right to declare one's ethnic origin and the offence of inciting disorder should be drawn. However, no judicial authority in Greece was disposed to affirm that a member of the \"Turkish minority\" enjoyed such a right. Be that as it may, the judge in a criminal case had a duty to take into consideration of his own motion, especially when contemplating imposing a heavy sentence on the defendant, the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and the Convention, which in Greece took precedence over legislation. \r\n29.   In its decision on the admissibility of the application the Commission dismissed the objection on the ground that the applicant had in substance raised before the Court of Cassation a complaint relating to a breach of Article 10 (art. 10). In addition, the Delegate of the Commission argued before the Court that it was sufficient, for the purposes of exhaustion, for the applicant to have challenged the State's actions in the domestic courts and thus afforded them the opportunity to put right the alleged violation. Referring to the case-law of the International Court of Justice and the generally recognised rules of international law (Article 26 of the Convention) (art. 26), he maintained that it was not necessary for the domestic remedy to be based on the same ground as the international remedy. \r\n30.   The Court does not accept that argument. It reiterates that the supervision machinery set up by the Convention is subsidiary to the national human rights protection systems. That principle is reflected in the rule set forth in Article 26 (art. 26), which \"dispenses States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system\" (see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, para. 50). \r\nIn its judgment of 16 September 1996 in the case of Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV), the Court emphasised that the application of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given. It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law (see the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, para. 34). \r\n31.   The Court notes that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law (Article 28 para. 1 of the Constitution - see paragraph 19 above). It further notes that Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) is directly applicable; Mr Ahmet Sadik could therefore have relied on that provision (art. 10) in the Greek courts and complained of a violation thereof in his case. \r\n32.   At no time, however, did the applicant rely on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), or on arguments to the same or like effect based on domestic law, in the courts dealing with his case. \r\nIn that respect there is a clear distinction between the present case and the cases of Castells v. Spain and Guzzardi v. Italy. Mr Castells relied in the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court on the relevant Article of the Spanish Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression (see the judgment of 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236, p. 20, para. 31), and although Mr Guzzardi did not rely in express terms on Article 5 of the Convention (art. 5) he did mention the Convention as a whole in the general context of living conditions on the island where he was required to live under a compulsory residence order (see the judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 27, para. 72). \r\n33.   In both the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal the applicant, who, in his appeal on points of law, put forward arguments which were based solely on domestic law and did not raise the matter of freedom of expression (see paragraph 17 above), merely defended himself against the charge of disturbing the peace, contrary to Article 192 of the Criminal Code. \r\nEven if the Greek courts were able, or even obliged, to examine the case of their own motion under the Convention, this cannot have dispensed the applicant from relying on the Convention in those courts or from advancing arguments to the same or like effect before them, thus drawing their attention to the problem he intended to submit subsequently, if need be, to the institutions responsible for European supervision (see the Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 19, para. 39). That applies where, as here, a charge of disturbing the peace may be challenged - and indeed in the present case was challenged by Mr Ahmet Sadik (see paragraphs 10, 11, 15, 17 and 18 above) - on the basis of arguments which do not raise the matter of freedom of expression. \r\n34.   Accordingly, domestic remedies were not exhausted in the instant case. \r\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT \r\n1.   Holds unanimously that the applicant's heirs have standing to continue the proceedings in the present case in his stead; \r\n\r\n2.   Holds by six votes to three that as domestic remedies have not been exhausted it cannot consider the merits of the case. \r\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 15 November 1996. \r\n\r\nRolv RYSSDAL \r\nPresident \r\n\r\nHerbert PETZOLD \r\nRegistrar \r\nIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 53 para. 2 of Rules of Court A, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment: \r\n(a) concurring opinion of Mr Valticos;\r\n(b) partly dissenting opinion of Mr Martens, joined by Mr Foighel; \r\n(c) partly dissenting opinion of Mr Morenilla. \r\nR. R. \r\nH. P.   \r\n \r\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE VALTICOS    \r\n(Translation) \r\nI consider it needful to sound a warning concerning the scope of the exhaustion-of-domestic-remedies principle, which, under the terms of Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26), must be construed \"according to the generally recognised rules of international law\". That means that the condition concerned cannot be minimised as is sometimes envisaged. \r\nObviously, it has often been pointed out that the Court's case-law has evolved considerably since the Convention came into force. \r\nIn the already long period which has elapsed since the Court was set up, ideas and needs in European countries have evolved - indeed in many ways have undergone profound changes - and the Court had a duty to reflect that intellectual and moral evolution, as far as possible. That was all the more necessary - and possible - because the substantive provisions of the Convention are often - but not always - drafted in a general way which permits such evolution, sometimes even to a radical degree. There are numerous examples of this and to dwell on the point would be to push against a half-open door. \r\nBut there is one important distinction to be made. While this evolution is normal - subject to the necessary precautions being taken - with regard to the Convention's substantive provisions, it can only be exceptional and limited with regard to the procedural provisions such as the fundamental rule of international law that domestic remedies must be exhausted. The Court has already made this rule more flexible by not requiring applicants to invoke an actual provision of the Convention in the domestic courts, only its substance, before a case can validly be referred to the Court. To seek to abolish this condition, or reduce it almost to nothing, with a view to a more complete protection of human rights, would certainly be prompted by a very laudable concern for justice but a very cavalier approach to the rules of international law. \r\nI therefore wish to emphasise the limits it would be dangerous to cross in this respect. The Court's present judgment respects those limits.\r\n     \r\n \r\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MARTENS, JOINED BY JUDGE FOIGHEL \r\nI.   INTRODUCTION \r\n1.   One of the essential arguments against the Court's doctrine that it has jurisdiction to examine afresh preliminary objections already rejected by the Commission is that this doctrine has rather unpalatable effects: it makes it possible, after long years of Strasbourg proceedings, for very important issues to remain undecided . \r\nThe present case well illustrates that point. It concerns the extent of the rights of ethnic minorities in a democratic society as well as the confines of the right to freedom of expression of campaigning politicians. Thus, the issues at stake were of considerable legal importance for the community of the Council of Europe at large. They were, moreover, highly emotional questions for the applicant and his fellow-members of the minority concerned. The Strasbourg proceedings on those issues started in July 1991. Since then the applicant himself has died and now, more than five years after their commencement (and nearly two years after the Commission's report in their favour) the European Court of Human Rights drily tells his widow and the children that those issues will not be decided for no other reason than that the applicant's lawyer in the domestic proceedings did not know his job. \r\n2.   I have voted for dismissal of the Government's preliminary objection. My primary argument for so voting was that I maintain, as a matter of principle, that the Court should leave it to the Commission to determine whether such pleas are founded or not. In the alternative I have done so for the reasons explained in paragraphs 4-14 below. \r\n3.   Had there been a majority for dismissal of the preliminary objection I would have voted for finding a violation. I think the case is of such importance that in paragraphs 16-23 below I will also briefly outline my arguments therefor. \r\n\r\n  See paragraph 4.2 of my dissenting opinion in the case of Brozicek v. Italy of 19 December 1989 (Series A no. 167, pp. 23 et seq.). My opposition to this doctrine - which has gradually won some support within the Court - was spurned in the Court's judgment of 25 March 1992 in the case of B. v. France (Series A no. 232-C). The present case has again confirmed my conviction that the doctrine is essentially wrong.\r\n\r\nII.   EXHAUSTION OF DOMESTIC REMEDIES   \r\nA. General considerations \r\n4.   In paragraphs 65-69 of its judgment of 16 September 1996 in the case of Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Reports of Judgments and Decisions for 1996-IV, pp. 1210-11) the Court has summarised its general doctrine on the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26). Not only summarised, but also refined. Refined in the sense that - in line with international tendencies in this area  - it has stressed more explicitly than in previous judgments the importance of making \"due allowance\" for the fact that the rule is being applied \"in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights\". Notably paragraph 68 in fine of the Akdivar and Others judgment shows that the Court has now essentially opted for what my friend Judge Morenilla has aptly called \"a flexible pro victima interpretation of this Article (art. 26)\" . \r\nquite fits into the system for the protection of human rights as it has developed during the last decades. After all, the rule dates back to the second half of the nineteenth century, when the individual was not yet recognised as a subject of international law, and its classical function was, then, to protect State sovereignty against excessive encroachment by State to-State claims on behalf of private individuals whose rights had allegedly been violated . \r\nIt would have been consistent with the essential changes which have occurred since then in the legal status of the individual under international law, especially where international law allows a victim of an alleged violation of human rights to seek redress on his own behalf, if in such cases the rule had been abandoned. Yet that has not been done. \r\nIt would, therefore, seem to me that the rule is, essentially, a relic of the original reluctance of certain States to set up an international court with the task of ensuring the fulfilment of their engagements under the Convention. In this context I refer to the Court's analysis in its De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium judgment . Present-day conditions, however, have changed also in this respect: all member States have long since accepted the Court's jurisdiction, and - it may be added - con amore, even if, as is only natural, they sometimes resent its decisions. This salutary evolution has greatly enhanced the protection of human rights in Europe. \r\nAgainst this background I find it open to doubt whether the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies still quite fits into the system because the rule thwarts the Court's power to do justice in those cases of violation of human rights where the victim has not enjoyed proper legal assistance in the domestic sphere. \r\n\r\n\r\n  See Jost Delbrück in: Jekewitz et al., Des Menschen Recht zwischen Freiheit und Verantwortung (Festschrift Josef Partsch), pp. 225 et seq..\r\n  See his dissenting opinion in the case of Cardot v. France (judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 24).\r\n  See the contribution of Delbrück referred to in note 2; see also Gurdip Singh in E.S. Venkataramiah (Editor), Human Rights in the Changing World (1988), p. 261.\r\n  See paragraph 50 of its judgment of 18 June 1971 (Series A no. 12, p. 29) where it said that \"the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies delimits the area within which the Contracting States have agreed to answer for wrongs alleged against them before the organs of the Convention\" and added that \"the Court has to ensure the observance of the provisions relating thereto just as of the individual rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention and its Protocols\", thereby suggesting that the defence plea was as important to States as fundamental rights to citizens. In paragraph 3.4 of my dissenting opinion referred to in note 1 I have already critically commented on this passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.   Admittedly, the Court has sought to minimise this wretched effect of the rule by accepting that its requirements are met where the complaint raised before the Convention organs has been pleaded before the national courts \"at least in substance\". \r\nThat is, however, but a poor palliative. Firstly, because the notion \"in substance\" is so vague as to leave ample room for differences of opinion, as is illustrated by the Cardot case as well as by the present case. Secondly, because it does not help in those cases where even the most considerate interpretation of the pleadings before the domestic courts does not allow the conclusion that there the applicant has raised \"at least in substance\" the complaints he now raises before the Convention organs. Yet, the Court has adamantly refused to go further. It notably has refused to accept that the requirements of the rule must be deemed to be met if: (a) applications have been made to the appropriate domestic courts and use has been made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given and (b) those courts were able, or even obliged, to examine the case of their own motion under the Convention . \r\n7.   In the Court's previous judgments arguments for this unyielding refusal are conspicuously lacking and even in the present judgment the majority, although challenged, has found nothing better than to repeat the pure petitio principii of paragraph 39 of the nearly 20-year-old Van Oosterwijck judgment cited above . \r\nFor my part, I have never been able to imagine sound reasons for this Van Oosterwijck doctrine . As I have already indicated in my dissenting opinion in the Cardot case: if under domestic law courts are bound to apply the Convention ex officio, the applicant by taking his case to the appropriate courts and availing himself of all possible remedies in principle provides those courts with the opportunity which the domestic remedies rule is designed to afford, namely \"the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged\" . \r\n\r\n\r\n  See the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 18, para. 34, in combination with its Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium judgment of 6 November 1980, p. 19, para. 39. The Commission takes the same view: see its case-law as summarised by Amerasinghe, Local Remedies in International Law (Grotius Publications Limited, Cambridge, 1990), p. 178. However, when the national court has considered the case ex officio, the Commission takes the view that the requirements of the rule are met (see its decision of 10 May 1979, application no. 8130/78, Decisions and Reports 16, p. 120).\r\n  See paragraph 33 of the Court's judgment.\r\n  Nor did I find such reasons in the sparse observations of learned authors. Flauss, who in RUDH 1991, pp. 529 et seq., has written a paper \"La condition de l'épuisement des griefs au sens de l'article 26 CEDH: les enseignements de l'arrêt Cardot\" (art. 26), merely contends that the interpretation of the rule should not be too favourable to individuals, but utterly fails to explain why an interpretation which prevents a (possible) victim of a violation of fundamental rights being denied justice on no other ground than that he or she is also a victim of his or her domestic counsel's incompetence, is too favourable to the individual. I would rather say that it is too favourable to the State! Florence Benoit-Rohmer in a note (Dalloz 1993, Jur. 563) on the Court's De Geouffre de la Pradelle v. France \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8.   Under these circumstances it is scarcely surprising that learned authors have time and again suggested that the real grounds for such decisions as the Van Oosterwijck and the Cardot judgments are to be sought elsewhere, namely in the Court's wish to avoid a decision on the merits . Similar comments may be expected in the present case. I find that rather unfortunate and an extra argument against the Court's rigid attitude in these matters. \r\n9.   For my part I take the view that if under domestic law courts are bound or able to apply the Convention ex officio, the applicant by taking his case to the appropriate courts and availing himself of all possible remedies has in principle met the requirements of Article 26 (art. 26). I think that this squares with the rationale of the domestic remedies rule and apart from that I can see various other good reasons for accepting this view, whilst the only argument that I can see against (see paragraph 13 below) can be taken care of otherwise than by following the impugned doctrine. \r\n\r\n\r\njudgment of 16 December 1992 merely claims that another interpretation than that of the Court \"aboutirait à vider de sa signification cette condition essentielle de recevabilité\".\r\n  Series A no. 200, p. 22, para. 2.\r\n  See, for example, Flauss in his article referred to in note 8, RUDH 1991, pp. 535 et seq.\r\n  See W.J. Ganshof van der Meersch, Organisations européennes I (Editions Sirey, Paris, 1966), pp. 374-75.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.   The reasons for the first proposition - which concerns the case where under national law domestic courts are bound to apply the Convention ex officio - have been stated already in paragraph 7 above. \r\n11.   As to the second proposition - which concerns the case where under national law domestic courts are able (but not obliged) to apply the Convention ex officio - I agree with Ganshof van der Meersch , who argued - as long ago as 1966 - that the system of the Convention implied that those courts were then under an obligation to apply the Convention ex officio. \r\nI recall, firstly, that the Court has consistently stressed - and in paragraph 30 of the present judgment again stresses - the subsidiary character of the machinery established by the Convention: the task of securing the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines falls in the first place to the Contracting States. Under the fundamental principle of rule of law which Article 6 of the Convention (art. 6) is intended to enshrine it is self evident that the domestic courts  of these States are - to the extent of their powers - bound to see to it that this obligation to safeguard human rights is honoured. This is confirmed by the Court's repeatedly drawing attention to the importance of incorporating the Convention into the domestic legal order and of treating its rules as directly applicable: as the Court said in paragraph 66 of its Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982 (Series A no. 51, p. 31), in States where these conditions are fulfilled the subsidiary character of the conventional machinery of protection is \"all the more pronounced\", undoubtedly since in such States domestic courts are in the best position to see to it that fundamental rights are secured. \r\nI recall, secondly, that the Court has recently, in paragraph 93 of its judgment of 23 March 1995 (preliminary objections) in the case of Loizidou v. Turkey (Series A no. 310, p. 31) stressed \"the special character of the Convention as an instrument of European public order (ordre public)\" . \r\nIt follows that under the Convention the same rule applies as has been accepted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities with respect to Community law : in those cases where domestic courts, under their national law, are in a position to apply the Convention ex officio, those courts must do so under the Convention. That is an obvious demand of the effectiveness both of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of European public order (ordre public) and of the \"national human right systems\". \r\n12.   I do not suggest that where national courts have neglected their duties in this respect, a complaint under Article 25 (art. 25) should lead to the finding of a violation. What I do suggest, however, is that in a case where an applicant has taken his case to the appropriate domestic courts and where, under domestic law, those courts were - either under their national law or, as indicated in paragraph 11 above, under the Convention - bound to apply the Convention even when the applicant failed to invoke it, in the Strasbourg proceedings the respondent State should not be permitted to rely on the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies rule. Admittedly, in such cases the applicant's lawyer was in default, but so were the domestic courts and under a true pro victima interpretation of Article 26 (art. 26) the latter default should prevail: I do not see why the principle of nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans should not apply to States. \r\n13.   As I said before, I can see but one objection against this liberal, pro victima interpretation of the rule of non-exhaustion in the context of the protection of human rights. This interpretation might allow an applicant to raise a complaint before the Convention organs which he deliberately omitted to mention before the domestic courts of the respondent State in order to be able to demonstrate in Strasbourg how badly human rights are protected in that State. \r\nOne can, of course, not exclude that possibility, especially in politically sensitive areas. However, one may safely assume that, as a rule, not relying on the Convention will not be the result of dolus malus but of sheer ignorance on the part of the applicant and of reprehensible incompetence on the part of his domestic lawyers. Moreover, applicants too must be presumed to be acting in good faith. The onus of alleging and establishing that the applicant deliberately refrained from relying on the Convention should therefore be on the State invoking the rule in a case where (a) the applicant has taken his case to the appropriate domestic courts, (b) the applicant before those courts has not even in substance relied on the Convention and (c) those courts were, nevertheless, bound to apply the Convention. Unless that onus is discharged in such cases the plea of non-exhaustion should be dismissed. \r\n\r\n\r\n  See instead of all other possible references the Court's Klass and Others v. Germany judgment of 6 September 1978, Series A no. 28, pp. 25-26, para. 55.\r\n  See also paragraph 75 of that judgment, where the Court even described the Convention as \"a constitutional instrument of European public order (ordre public)\".\r\n  See its judgment of 14 December 1995 in the joint cases C-430/93 and C-431/93, ECR 1995-I, pp. 4705 et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14.   There is one more remark to be made on the onus in the present context. In my opinion the distribution of proof is such that it is for the applicant to satisfy the Court that, in principle, the domestic courts were in a position to apply the Convention ex officio, whilst -once this burden of proof has been discharged - it is incumbent on the Government which nevertheless maintain their objection to establish that, due to the special circumstances obtaining in the concrete case, the domestic courts were not in a position to base their judgment on such ex officio application of the Convention.   \r\nB. Application to the present case \r\n15.   Applying the above general considerations to the case of Ahmet Sadik I note in the first place that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law  and that, moreover, Article 10 (art. 10) is directly applicable under Greek law. Consequently, my starting-point is that the Greek Supreme Court, when dealing with the applicant's appeal against his conviction by the Patras Court of Appeal, in principle could and should have applied Article 10 (art. 10) - as interpreted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights - ex officio (see paragraph 11 above). \r\nI note in the second place that, even supposing that the Greek Supreme Court in criminal cases lacks the power to quash of its own motion, this does not necessarily imply that it cannot ex officio supplement legal arguments for grievances put forward by the appellant. In this context I recall that the grievances raised by the applicant were very broad: he maintained, inter alia, that the prosecution case should have been dismissed and that the Patras Court of Appeal had not given sufficient reasons for its decision . It follows from the above that in assessing whether these grievances justified quashing the Court of Appeal's judgment the Supreme Court should not have restricted itself to merely examining the arguments, mainly based on domestic law and practice, put forward by the applicant's lawyer in support of those grievances, but should have examined moreover whether these grievances might justify quashing when based on the argument that taking into account the applicant's rights under Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) the prosecution case should have been dismissed or the Patras Court of Appeal should have given better reasons for its decision. Thus supplementing the arguments would have meant, in the light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, that the Greek Supreme Court should also have assessed ex officio whether the applicant's conviction and sentence were proportionate. It should have scrutinised the lower courts' judgments in the light of Article 10 (art. 10), that is: should have critically examined whether their findings of fact and their reasoning were sufficiently solid to justify convincingly the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression. \r\nI appreciate that the Greek Supreme Court has competence to deal with questions of law only, but I am not satisfied that - as the Government have suggested - the controlling and balancing exercise involved exceeds the powers of a supreme court having competence with regard to questions of law only. Having now served for two decades as a member of such a court myself, I feel confident to say that both that scrutiny and that balancing exercise are, essentially, a strictly legal assessment of the facts established by the lower courts. Thus, the Government have failed to prove that the Greek Supreme Court could not do what it should have done (see paragraph 14 above in fine). \r\nIn sum, the applicant's appeal provided the Supreme Court with the opportunity required under Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26) of putting right a possible violation of Article 10 (art. 10). The Greek Government's exception therefore fails. \r\n\r\n  See paragraph 31 of the Court's judgment. See also: Alkema, Bellekom, Drzemczewski and Schokkenbroek (Editors), The Domestic Implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Eastern and Western Europe, Proceedings of the seminar held in Leiden, 24-26 October 1991, pp. 26 et seq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  THE MERITS \r\n16.   It is obvious that the applicant's conviction and sentence constituted an interference with his rights under Article 10 para. 1 of the Convention (art. 10-1) and that this interference was justified under paragraph 2 (art. 10 2) to the extent that it met the requirement implied in the words \"prescribed by law\" as well as that of serving a legitimate aim within the meaning of this paragraph (art. 10-2). The only question to be answered is, therefore, whether the applicant's conviction and sentence were proportionate, whether they were \"necessary in a democratic society\". \r\n17.   There is no doubt that use of speech \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action\" and \"likely to incite or produce such action\" may be proscribed. The Greek courts held that the applicant had deliberately used such speech in a pamphlet of October 1989 and therefore convicted him . It is of importance to note that this conviction was exclusively based on the applicant's repeatedly referring to the Muslim minority in Western Thrace as \"Turkish\": the remainder of the contents of the pamphlet was not taken into consideration. Thus, what is in issue is only whether, in the relevant circumstances of the case, the mere fact of repeatedly referring to the Muslim minority as \"Turkish\" justified the applicant's conviction and sentence. \r\n18.   It is a significant feature of the present case that the impugned terminology was used in the context of a political debate by a politician campaigning for election. Moreover, and above all, it was used by a politician belonging to a specific minority who sought to win votes by stressing his leadership of that minority and by proclaiming his conviction that this minority was to be characterised not only by its religion but also by its ethnic origin, that is by its being Turkish. \r\n\r\n\r\n  See paragraph 17 of the Court's judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.   When criminal provisions purporting to prevent disturbance of public peace are relied on against a politician who is not only an opponent and a critic of the Government but also a member of a minority, the European Court of Human Rights should apply its highest standards of scrutiny in order to ascertain whether these provisions have been abused, as they easily may be and often are. \r\nThere is all the more reason for extreme vigilance because the criticism concerned the Government's attitude towards the minority in question and more especially their policy of denying that the minority is not only a religious but also an ethnic one. \r\nIn such cases there is no room for relying on the judgments of the national courts nor for a margin of appreciation. \r\n20.   Against this background the decisive question is whether the Government have convincingly established, firstly, that the mere fact that the leader of a minority, in a political pamphlet which was evidently exclusively meant for that minority, repeatedly designated that minority as \"Turkish\" was indeed provocative of discord between majority and minority and of acts of violence between the two groups, and, secondly, that this use of the impugned designation was attributable to seditious intention. \r\n\r\n\r\n  See paragraphs 10 and 15 of the Court's judgment. The Patras Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that \"the accused deliberately sought to instil and implant (...) the seeds of discord, hatred and hostility towards the Christian Greeks who lived in the same region\".\r\n\r\n\r\n21.   I have not been satisfied that this question may be answered in the affirmative. \r\nThe picture which arises both from some of the statements of the witnesses for the prosecution and from the comments in the Government's memorial - which, incidentally, go much further than those statements - is one of a long-standing tension between majority and minority, a tension for which presumably both sides, but certainly also the Greek authorities bear responsibility. It has not even been made plausible, let alone convincingly established that this tension exclusively or mainly resulted from the mere use of the impugned designation. There is little or no evidence for the Government's thesis on the long-range policy of secession which they see behind the impugned use of the designation \"Turkish\". Nor is there a scrap of evidence for the assertion that there is a direct or even an indirect causal link between the impugned terminology in the pamphlet of October 1989 and the violence and disorder of 29 January 1990. If the latter incidents are at all attributable to a reaction by the minority to earlier events  it would be more plausible to link them to the petty and unwise endeavours of the authorities to suppress the self-designation \"Turkish\". \r\n22.   In sum, I have not been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were a justifiable response to truly reprehensible use of seditious language. It follows that neither have I been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were necessary in a democratic society. \r\n23.   For these reasons I find that there has been a violation.    \r\n \r\n   In its report referred to in paragraph 4 of the Court's judgment Helsinki Watch suggests that the incidents were rather the work of the majority!\r\n \r\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE MORENILLA    \r\n(Translation)\r\nWith regret, I part company with the majority as regards its conclusion that the Court cannot deal with the merits of the applicant's complaints on account of his failure to exhaust domestic remedies. I refer once more to my dissenting opinion annexed to the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991 (Series A no. 200, p. 23), which the majority cite in paragraph 30 in fine, where I set out my reasons for opposing a fresh examination by the Court of a plea of inadmissibility that had already been submitted to the Commission and dismissed in the Commission's decision on the admissibility of the application in accordance with Article 27 para. 3 of the Convention (art. 27-3) (paragraph 29 of the judgment).\r\nI consider too that in the present case Mr Ahmet Sadik invoked his right to freedom of expression in substance in the Greek criminal courts on account of the very nature of the offence of disturbing the public peace that he was accused of and for which he was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment, in particular for contravening Article 192 of the Criminal Code through the communiqués he had published during the elections as a candidate of the Güven political party representing part of the Muslim population of Western Thrace.\r\nIn these accusations and in his conviction the question of the freedom of expression of the candidates for election to the Greek Parliament, even if it was not expressly raised, constituted the substance of the impugned criminal offences and the proceedings brought in the Greek criminal courts which were capable of remedying the applicant's complaints. Article 27 of the Convention (art. 27) requires a flexible interpretation without excessive regard for matters of form (see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72), a \"pro victima\" approach in favour of admissibility in order to allow the Convention institutions to consider the alleged complaints. \r\n\r\n",
