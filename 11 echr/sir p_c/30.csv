" In this regard, the applicant mainly focuses on internal
structural and organisational matters.",premise
"He refers, inter alia, to the
status, roles and duties of the Convening Officer, the Judge Advocate
and the Judge Advocate General's office.",premise
"The applicant also refers to
the relationship of the members of the court-martial, the Convening
Officer and the Reviewing Authorities to the prosecuting authority.",premise
"He
points to the lack of civilian judicial members of the court-martial,
the absence of guarantees against outside pressures and the ad hoc
nature of the appointment of the members of the court-martial.",premise
"The
applicant submits that, inter alia, the above factors demonstrate a
lack, or at least a perceived lack, of independence and impartiality
particularly when, as in his case, an important policy issue in respect
of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder arose for consideration.",conclusion
,
"The Government
point out, inter alia, that the members of the court-martial take an
oath of independence and impartiality,",premise
"that none of those members is
subject to instruction by a higher authority,",premise
"that the Convening
Officer is not the prosecuting authority,",premise
"that the Judge Advocate and
the advisers in the Judge Advocate General's office are civilians,
experienced members of the legal profession and totally independent of
the armed forces, and that an individual member of a court-martial
cannot be removed by a superior officer once appointed.
",premise
" The Government also argue that the Judge Advocate must satisfy
himself that none of the members of the court-martial knows the accused
or has heard anything about the charges.",premise
"In the present case the
applicant did not object to the constitution of the court-martial and
in any event, according to the Government, it does not follow from the
fact that the members of the court-martial were all subordinate in rank
to the Convening Officer (having no direct prior relationship with that
Officer) that they lacked independence or impartiality.
",premise
"The Government argue that the independence and impartiality of
these bodies is demonstrated by a number of factors.",conclusion
,
"He argues that, inter alia, these factors meant that he was neither
able to establish upon what basis the relevant bodies made their
decisions nor, therefore, effectively able to participate in any of the
post-hearing reviews and the judicial review proceedings.
",premise
"The applicant also points, in this respect, to an inequality of
arms between the prosecution and the defence due to the Convening
Officer's effective control of the court-martial hearing through the
prosecuting officer, and to the conduct of the prosecuting officer, the
Judge Advocate and the Convening Officer (the latter of whom allegedly
failed to ensure the attendance of a vital witness) in respect of that
hearing.",premise
"These factors, the applicant submits, also contributed to the
overall unfairness of the proceedings against him.",premise
"He also takes issue
with the limited sentencing regime available and the reasonableness of
the decisions reached in his case.",premise
" In this respect the applicant points mainly to the lack of
reasons for the decisions of the court-martial, the Confirming Officer
and the Reviewing Authorities, the privacy surrounding the advice given
by the Judge Advocate and the Judge Advocate General's office, together
with the administrative and private nature of the post-hearing reviews.",premise
"Secondly, the applicant complains that the court-martial hearing
and the post-hearing reviews were neither fair nor public.",conclusion
,
"The second Reviewing Authority did not
seek any such advice, and therefore a person without any legal
qualifications or advice made the final decision on the applicant's
petition against sentence.",premise
"The Government also submit that, in light of the importance of
discipline in the armed forces and in view of the seriousness of the
charges, the reasons for the sentence were obvious.",premise
" In addition, the Government dispute that the Convening Officer
controlled the proceedings through the prosecuting officer, and point
out that the applicant was represented by an experienced lawyer.",premise
"The
Government also refer to the fact that the conduct of the Judge
Advocate was considered and found acceptable by the Divisional Court,
and submit that the prosecuting officer did all that was possible to
ensure the attendance of the relevant witness, including issuing a
witness summons.",premise
"The applicant has, according to the Government, no
right to an appeal under the Convention and, in any event, the post-
hearing reviews are not, according to the Government, designed to be
full appeals, but rather further pleas in mitigation.",premise
" In respect of the sentencing regime, the Government submit that
the question of whether the accused is tried by the civilian or
military authorities is a decision for the civilian authorities, though
by agreement the military authorities do not have to report certain
matters to the civilian authorities.",premise
"A wider sentencing regime is not
possible due to the lack of facilities in the armed forces and to the
fact that some sentences would be inappropriate to pass upon a serving
member of the armed forces and inconsistent with his duties.",premise
"The
Government further submit that the decision of the court-martial was
reasonable in view of, inter alia, the importance of discipline in army
life, the context in which the offences were committed and the
seriousness of the charges.",premise
"  The Government therefore conclude that all of the applicant's
complaints under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention should
be deemed manifestly ill-founded, or that the case does not disclose
a violation of the Convention.
