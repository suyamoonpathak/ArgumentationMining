"They refer to the safeguards
provided in the Order: no inference may be drawn unless the
suspect/accused has been warned in advance of the possible effect;
before any inference is drawn, the prosecution must have established
a prima facie case against the accused; the judge has a discretion
whether to draw an inference and is limited to drawing only such
inferences as may be proper.",premise
"The Order merely allows the trier of fact
to draw such inferences as common sense dictates.",premise
"In the present case,
there was a formidable case against the applicant which called for
evidence from the applicant if there was an innocent explanation for
his conduct.",premise
"The burden of proof remained throughout on the
prosecution.",premise
" The Government submit that the provisions of the 1988 Order did
not operate to deprive the applicant either of a fair hearing contrary
to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) or of the presumption of innocence
contrary Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2).",conclusion
,
"As regards the denial of access by the applicant to his solicitor
for 48 hours, the Government contend that this delay did not
disadvantage the applicant in the conduct of his defence and",premise
"therefore
discloses no violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.",conclusion
,
"Since
the police have similar powers to delay access in England and Wales,",premise
"they submit that there is no discrimination in this respect within the
meaning of Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.
",conclusion
,
"The difference in this respect between the position in
England and Wales and that in Northern Ireland, based as it was solely
on the geographical location at which a person was arrested and
detained,",premise
"did not amount to discriminatory treatment within the meaning
of Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.
",conclusion
,
"Further, the denial
of access by the applicant to his solicitor for 48 hours and the
discriminatory practice of not permitting solicitors to be present at
any stage while a person arrested under prevention of terrorism
provisions is being interviewed,",premise
"The discriminatory element derives, inter alia, from the
fact that in England and Wales, contrary to the practice in Northern
Ireland, all detained persons, including those detained under
prevention of terrorism legislation, are permitted to have their legal
representative present during the police interviews.",premise
"violates Article 6 (Art. 6) either
alone or read in conjunction with Article 14 (Art. 6+14) of the
Convention.",conclusion
,
"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious
issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which
should depend on an examination of the merits.",premise
"It follows that the
application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded.",conclusion
,
"As regards the refusal of permission to the applicant's solicitor
to be present during his interviews with the police",premise
"the Government
state that this too did not affect the conduct of the applicant's
defence and disclosed no violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the
Convention.",conclusion
,
"The applicant submits that the 1988 Order, which permits
inferences to be drawn from the failure of an accused to answer police
questions or to give evidence, and the reliance placed upon it by the
trial judge in the instant case,",premise
"The very strong inferences drawn by the trial judge
in the applicant's case played a crucial role in his conviction.",premise
"It is
submitted that it is a generally recognised principle of international
law that an accused person cannot be required to incriminate himself,
that Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention enshrines this principle, and
that the drawing of an incriminating inference from an accused's
failure to give evidence infringes his right to a fair trial.
",premise
"The applicant also submits that the drawing of an incriminating
inference from the failure of an accused person to give evidence has
the effect of placing the burden of proof on an accused and is
manifestly inconsistent with the presumption of innocence guaranteed
in Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention.",premise
"violate Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1)
of the Convention.",conclusion
