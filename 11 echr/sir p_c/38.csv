Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate

provide effective and sufficient redress.",premise

to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to
constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing
the alleged breach.",premise

there is a choice of remedies open to an applicant, Article 26
(Art. 26) of the Convention must be applied to reflect the practical
realities of the applicant's position in order to ensure the effective
protection of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention (cf.

pursuing proceedings in the courts of Northern Ireland was not
unreasonable or without basis in domestic law.",premise

proceedings (in respect of which they were granted legal aid by the
relevant domestic authorities) intended, inter alia, to argue that
liability arose out of the actions of Crown agents based in the United
Kingdom and Northern Ireland.",premise

of State were however conclusive of the fact that the alleged liability
did not arise in respect of the Government in the United Kingdom or in
Northern Ireland and effectively put an end to the proceedings.",premise

cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic
remedies.",conclusion

lawful.",premise

jury considered that there had been no plot to kill the deceased
terrorists, that the soldiers had honestly and reasonably believed that
there was a car bomb which could be detonated by remote control and
that the degree of force used by the soldiers was proportionate to the
aim of protecting the lives of the people of Gibraltar.",premise

it provided an exhaustive fact-finding investigation by an independent
body.",premise

(including the S.A.S soldiers and Security Service personnel involved
in the incident) were extensively examined and cross-examined by the
legal representatives of the applicants, that the Inquest was held
within six months of the incident, that the applicants' representatives
made no challenge to the public immunity certificates, and that the
Coroner exercised his discretion to allow certain questions, despite
objection by the Crown on the basis of the certificates.",premise
