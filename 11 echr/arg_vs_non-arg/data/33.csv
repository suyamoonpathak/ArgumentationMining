"They add, in this respect, that although the offence under Section 5 of the Road Traffic Act was not, as such, in force at the date of the reservation, the law then in force did impose an obligation on road users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users.",argumentative
"To the extent that the absence of an oral hearing is raised, the respondent Government also rely on the Austrian reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.",argumentative
They also point out that the applicant did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the Administrative Court.,argumentative
"They accept, however, that if the reservation does not prevent an examination, then the review of administrative decisions by the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court was not sufficiently wide to comply with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.",argumentative
because it cannot cover offences which were not in force at the date of the reservation.,argumentative
The applicant considers that the Austrian reservation to Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention is in any event not applicable in the present case,argumentative
"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution, the Government consider that, although the provision provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made",argumentative
The Government point out that any appeal lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to comprehensive review.,argumentative
"the ability of the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural, not a substantive limitation.",argumentative
"The applicant in this respect considers that the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction has been limited subsequ entry into force of Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution,",argumentative
"that therefore, even if the reservation applies, it has not been complied with in this respect.",argumentative
as it is not intended to have legally binding effects on the interpretation.,argumentative
"With regard to the declaration made by Austria when ratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the declaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention",argumentative
"They point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed on 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case on 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988, whereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988.",argumentative
"With regard to the declaration made by Austria when ratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the declaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention",argumentative
"Finally, they consider that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) has in any event been complied with as it applies only where the facts and legal provisions are to be regarded as a unit.",argumentative
"Thus, they conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may nevertheless be convicted under these.",argumentative
"Thus, they conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may nevertheless be convicted under these.",argumentative
The Government underline that the offence of causing death under the influence of drink contained in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code is different in character from the provision of Section 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act,argumentative
which makes it an offence to drive a motor vehicle whilst unfit to drive through drink.,argumentative
"The applicant underlines that for the individual concerned the principle ""ne bis in idem"" must apply to every punishable act, and not merely to the provision of law.",argumentative
He points out that both criminal and administrative authorities apply a level of 0.8 per mille as constituting a state of inebriation.,argumentative
"as it is not clear whether it covers double or multiple convictions only by the Austrian criminal courts, or double or multiple convictions by Austrian criminal courts on the one hand and Austrian administrative criminal authorities on the other.",argumentative
"He also considers that the declaration made to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4) does not comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention",argumentative
The Commission finds that the complaint relating to the presumption of innocence was not made in the applicant's application form or in correspondence with the Commission's Secretariat.,argumentative
"The mere fact that, by virtue of general words a complaint is not excluded from an application, is not sufficient to regard that complaint as having been made.",argumentative
This part of the application must accordingly be rejected under Article 26 in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 26+27-3) of the Convention as having been introduced out of time.,argumentative
"They point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed on 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case on 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988, whereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988.",argumentative
"The Government submit that because the Administrative Court is required to review a decision under administrative criminal law on the basis of the substantive law at the date of commission of the offence (or at the date of the first instance decision if more advantageous to a defendant), the fact that the Administrative Court took its decision five months after the Protocol had entered into force does not affect the position",argumentative
"the respondent Government submit first, that the Commission is prevented ratione temporis from considering this complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4).",argumentative
"The Commission finds that these complaints raise complex issues of law under the Convention, including questions concerning the Austrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the Convention, the Austrian declaration to Protocol No. 7 (P7) to the Convention and questions concerning the competence of the Commission ratione temporis to deal with the complaints under Protocol No. 7 (P7), the determination of which must be reserved to an examination of the merits.",argumentative
This part of the application cannot therefore be declared manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,argumentative
This part of the application must accordingly be rejected under Article 26 in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 26+27-3) of the Convention as having been introduced out of time.,argumentative
"For these reasons, the Commission unanimously DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the applicant's complaint relating to the presumption of innocence and by a majority DECLARES ADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application, without prejudging the merits of the case.",argumentative
Having regard to Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; Having regard to the application introduced on 22 May 1989 by Josef Gradinger against Austria and registered on 10 January 1990 under file No. 15963/90; Having regard to: - the report provided for in Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission; - the observations submitted by the respondent Government on 10 March 1992 and the observations in reply submitted by the applicant on 13 July 1992 ; - the submissions of the parties at the oral hearings held on 10 May 1993; Having deliberated; Decides as follows:,non-argumentative

"The ""note of the minutes and sentence"" (Protokolls- und Urteilsvermerk) states that, in calculating the sentence, the court considered that the applicant had been drinking alcohol before the offence, but that the condition of Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code (the aggravating circumstance of alcohol consumption) was not present.",non-argumentative
"The ""Facts"" part of the ""note"" referred to the indictment, and added the words ""but without the element of alcohol"" (""wobei die Alkoholisierung entfällt"").",non-argumentative

"The authority relied on a report from its own doctor that, as the level in the applicant's blood had been 0.8 per mille one and a half hours after the accident, he must have had at least O.95 per mille alcohol in his blood at the time of the accident.",non-argumentative
"The applicant appealed to the Lower Austrian Provincial Government (Niederösterreichische Landesregierung) which, on 27 July 1988, rejected his appeal.",non-argumentative

There was accordingly nothing unlawful in convicting and sentencing the applicant for the administrative offence.,non-argumentative
"The applicant considers that, as he was acquitted in the criminal proceedings of having had an unlawful amount of blood alcohol, the principle of ""ne bis in idem"" accordingly prohibits a subsequent conviction under Article 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act.",non-argumentative
"At the hearing on 10 May 1993 the applicant for the first time raised issues under Article 6 para. 2 in that, given that he had been acquitted before the criminal court of driving with an excess amount of alcohol in his blood, his susequent conviction in administrative criminal proceedings for susbstantially the same offence offended against the presumption of innocence.",non-argumentative
