"The Court notes that this particular complaint was not dealt with by the Commission in its report or admissibility decision and that, as pointed out by the Delegate of the Commission, it is uncertain whether it can be regarded as falling within the compass of the case before the Court as delimited by the Commission’s decision on admissibility",argumentative
"(see, inter alia, the Powell and Rayner v. the United Kingdom judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 172, p. 13, para. 29).",argumentative
"In any event, given the fact that the applicant’s punitive period has now expired, the Court does not consider it necessary to examine this complaint.",argumentative
"The scope of the case before the Court is therefore confined to the issues under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) raised in connection with the applicant’s current situation, that is post-tariff detention.",argumentative
"(see paragraph 26 above), which the Court examined in its Wynne v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 July 1994 (Series A no. 294-A),",argumentative
in that the former is not solely based on the gravity of the offence but takes into account the age of the offender.,argumentative
"In the applicant’s submission, a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure differed from the mandatory life sentence imposed on adults",argumentative
"The principle that crimes committed by young persons should not be punished as severely as the crimes of adults is, in the applicant’s submission, contained in all civilised penal codes.",argumentative
"In this respect, the purpose of a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is not wholly punitive in character but partly punitive and partly preventive.",argumentative
"In support of his argument the applicant referred to the historical origins of the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" (the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 and the Children’s Act 1908 - see paragraphs 27 and 29 above) in which context it had a clear preventive purpose.",argumentative
"He further referred to the wording of section 53 of the 1933 Act (""a person [under 18] ... shall not, if ... convicted of murder, be sentenced to imprisonment for life"" - see paragraph 29 above) and to the indeterminacy of the very formula used in the sentence (""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"").",argumentative
"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence.",argumentative
"In view of the above, the applicant concluded that a sentence of detention under section 53 was closer in its indeterminacy and preventive objectives to a discretionary life sentence, as examined by the Court in the case of Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell cited above than to a mandatory life sentence.",argumentative
"As in that case, after the tariff has expired, the only legitimate basis for the applicant’s continued detention would be a finding of his continued dangerousness, a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time (ibid., p. 30, para. 76).",argumentative
This was particularly so in the case of offenders who could be as young as ten at the time of the commission of the offence.,argumentative
"It follows that at that phase in the execution of his sentence, the applicant was entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to have the lawfulness of his continued detention and of any re-detention determined by a court at reasonable intervals.",argumentative
"The Government, for their part, contended that the sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has an essentially punitive character and is imposed automatically on all juvenile murderers on the strength of the gravity of their offence, regardless of their mental state or dangerousness.",argumentative
This explains why under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 the same release procedures govern both mandatory life sentences passed on adults and sentences of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure and why the same administrative policies are applied to both (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,argumentative
"Furthermore, after the tariff period has elapsed, not only the prisoner’s dangerousness but also the acceptability to the public of his early release must be considered with a view to maintaining public confidence in the system of criminal justice (see paragraph 38 above).",argumentative
"It was further contended that, apart from the fact that persons sentenced to detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure would not be detained in a prison during the early stages of their detention but in a special institution for young offenders, the sentence was nothing more than the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for adults.",argumentative
"In these circumstances, the issues in the present case were practically identical to those in the Wynne case (cited above at paragraph 55) where the Court found that the original trial and appeal proceedings satisfied the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",argumentative
"It is true, as submitted by the Government, that a sentence of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure is mandatory: it is fixed by law and is imposed automatically in all cases where persons under the age of 18 are convicted of murder, the trial judge having no discretion.",argumentative
It is also the case that the 1991 Act as well as recent policy statements treat the sentence at issue in the present case in an identical manner to mandatory life sentences as regards proceedings for release on licence and recall (see paragraphs 31 and 35 above).,argumentative
"On the other hand, it is undisputed that, in its statutory origins, the expression ""during Her Majesty’s pleasure"" had a clearly preventive purpose and that - unlike sentences of life custody or life imprisonment - the word ""life"" is not mentioned in the description of the sentence.",argumentative
"Nevertheless, important as these arguments may be for the understanding of the sentence of detention under section 53 in English law, the decisive issue in the present context is whether the nature and, above all, the purpose of that sentence are such as to require the lawfulness of the continued detention to be examined by a court satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",argumentative
It is recalled that the applicant was sentenced to be detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure because of his young age at the time of the commission of the offence.,argumentative
"In the case of young persons convicted of serious crimes, the corresponding sentence undoubtedly contains a punitive element and accordingly a tariff is set to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence.",argumentative
"However, an indeterminate term of detention for a convicted young person, which may be as long as that person’s life, can only be justified by considerations based on the need to protect the public.",argumentative
"These considerations, centred on an assessment of the young offender’s character and mental state and of his or her resulting dangerousness to society, must of necessity take into account any developments in the young offender’s personality and attitude as he or she grows older.",argumentative
"A failure to have regard to the changes that inevitably occur with maturation would mean that young persons detained under section 53 would be treated as having forfeited their liberty for the rest of their lives, a situation which, as the applicant and the Delegate of the Commission pointed out, might give rise to questions under Article 3 (art. 3) of the Convention.",argumentative
"Against this background the Court concludes that the applicant’s sentence, after the expiration of his tariff, is more comparable to a discretionary life sentence.",argumentative
The Commission found that the Parole Board’s lack of decision-making power,argumentative
meant that it could not be regarded as a body satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).,argumentative
"As in Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (p. 30, para. 80) and despite the new policy allowing persons detained under section 53 of the 1933 Act the opportunity to see the material before the Parole Board (see paragraphs 15 and 30 above), the Court sees no reason to depart from its findings in the case of Weeks (cited above, pp. 29-33, paras. 60-69) that the Parole Board does not satisfy the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",argumentative
"Indeed, to the extent to which the Parole Board cannot order the release of a prisoner this is not contested by the Government.",argumentative
"However, the lack of adversarial proceedings before the Parole Board also prevents it from being regarded as a court or court-like body for the purposes of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4).",argumentative
"As to the need for an oral hearing, the Delegate of the Commission added that judicial review ""is a very uncertain remedy given the fact that express provision is made for an oral hearing in the case of discretionary life prisoners, but not in the case of persons detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure"".",argumentative
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Kremzow v. Austria judgment of 21 September 1993, Series A no. 268-B, p. 45, para. 67).",argumentative
"The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing",argumentative
"The Court recalls in this context that, in matters of such crucial importance as the deprivation of liberty and where questions arise which involve, for example, an assessment of the applicant’s character or mental state, it has held that it may be essential to the fairness of the proceedings that the applicant be present at an oral hearing",argumentative
"The Court is of the view that, in a situation such as that of the applicant, where a substantial term of imprisonment may be at stake and where characteristics pertaining to his personality and level of maturity are of importance in deciding on his dangerousness, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) requires an oral hearing in the context of an adversarial procedure involving legal representation and the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses.",argumentative
It is not an answer to this requirement that the applicant might have been able to obtain an oral hearing by instituting proceedings for judicial review.,argumentative
"In the first place, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) presupposes the existence of a procedure in conformity with its requirements without the necessity of instituting separate legal proceedings in order to bring it about.",argumentative
"In the second place, like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court is not convinced that the applicant’s possibility of obtaining an oral hearing by way of proceedings for judicial review is sufficiently certain to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",argumentative
"In conclusion, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention in that the applicant, after the expiry of his tariff, was unable to bring before a court with the powers and procedural guarantees satisfying that provision (art. 5-4) the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure or of his re-detention following the revocation of his licence.",argumentative
"The Court notes that, had the Parole Board’s recommendations been binding on the Secretary of State, the applicant would have joined a pre-release employment scheme in July 1994.",argumentative
"He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000.",argumentative
"On the basis of the evidence before it, however, it cannot speculate as to what the applicant’s conduct would have been and whether he would have been eventually released.",argumentative
"He quantified his claim at £100,000 or, if the Court were only to find a causal link between the violation found and his continued detention as of July 1994, at £25,000.",argumentative
"As to the moral damage allegedly suffered, the Court shares the Government’s view that, in the circumstances, the finding of a violation constitutes sufficient just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 50 (art. 50).",argumentative
"For the legal costs and expenses in bringing his case before the Convention institutions, the applicant claimed the sum of £22,058.73 inclusive of value added tax.",argumentative
The Government found the sum claimed excessive.,argumentative
"In the light of the criteria emerging from its case-law, the Court holds that the applicant should be awarded the amount of £13,000 less 15,421 French francs already paid by way of legal aid in respect of fees and travel and subsistence expenses.",argumentative
"in that theapplicant, after the expiry of his punitive period, wasunable to bring before a court the case of his continueddetention or of his re-detention following the revocationof his licence;",argumentative
"FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY 1. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention",argumentative

"At the hearing, the Agent of the Government invited the Court to conclude that, in the present case, there had been no breach of the Convention.",non-argumentative
"The applicant, for his part, asked the Court to uphold his complaints and declare that his rights under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) had been violated, both by the denial of a review by a court-like body and by the denial at any time of an oral hearing at which he could have put his case for release in person.",non-argumentative

"tothe public."" 11. On 27 August 1991, having complained to the Avon Probation Service about its recommendation, Mr Singh received a more detailed explanation of his recall in a letter from the chief probation officer.",non-argumentative
"The reason given for his recall was not the alleged offences (which were a matter for the court), but rather his failure to provide accurate information about his circumstances to his supervising probation officer.",non-argumentative
The letter cited specifically his failure to inform her about the purchase of a motor vehicle; getting a job and giving false information to his employers about his age and character; having a relationship and not telling his girlfriend all about his background; and falling into arrears with his rent.,non-argumentative
"Mr Singh denied the accuracy of most of these allegations, and asked the Parole Board to review the merits of the revocation of his licence.",non-argumentative

He was not told the reasons for this decision.,non-argumentative

By a communication of 8 September 1994 the applicant was given the reasons for the Secretary of State’s decision.,non-argumentative
"These were that Mr Singh had misled the probation service after his release in October 1990 and had appeared before the magistrates on several criminal charges, although these had subsequently been dismissed on technical grounds.",non-argumentative
"Thus, he had been recalled to prison ""following serious breaches of the trust placed in [him] as a life licensee"".",non-argumentative
"The Secretary of State was unable to assess accurately whether he was still a threat to the public, because he had spent the three and a quarter years since his recall in a closed prison.",non-argumentative

"The court found, inter alia, that the correct test to be applied was whether Mr Singh constituted a danger to the ""life or limb"" of the public, and that the reasoning process of the Secretary of State had been flawed because he had not properly explained how the findings he had made related to the test of dangerousness (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (no. 2), unreported).",non-argumentative

"Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law in contrast to discretionary life sentences, which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences (for example manslaughter, rape, robbery).",non-argumentative
"The principles underlying the passing of a discretionary life sentence are: (i) that the offence is grave and (ii) that there are exceptional circumstances whichdemonstrate that the offender is a danger to the publicand that it is not possible to say when that danger willsubside. Discretionary life sentences are indeterminate so that ""the prisoner’s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody only so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large"" (R. v. Wilkinson [1983] 5 Criminal Appeal Reports 105, 108).",non-argumentative
"The notion of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure has its origins in statutory form in an Act of 1800 for ""the safe custody of insane persons charged with offences"" (Criminal Lunatics Act), which provided that defendants acquitted of a charge of murder, treason or felony on the grounds of insanity at the time of the offence were to be detained in ""strict custody until His Majesty’s pleasure shall be known"" and described their custody as being ""during His [Majesty’s] pleasure"".",non-argumentative
"In 1908, detention during His Majesty’s pleasure was introduced in respect of offenders aged between 10 and 16.",non-argumentative

"""At the time of sentencing, the detention orders under section 53 were mandatory.",non-argumentative
It is indeed the statutory equivalent for young persons of the mandatory life sentence for murder.,non-argumentative
But the sentence itself is closer in substance to the discretionary sentence of which part is punitive (retribution and deterrence) and the balance justified only by the interests of public safety when the test of dangerousness is satisfied.,non-argumentative
"The fact that the mandatory life prisoner may be given similar rights as regards release on licence does not alter the fact that the mandatory life sentence is justifiable as punishment for the whole of its period: see R. v. Secretary of State Ex. p. Doody & Others [1993] Q.B. 157 and Wynne v. UK (E.C.H.R. 1st December 1992). The order for detention under section 53 is by its terms both discretionary and indeterminate: it provides for detention ‘during Her Majesty’s pleasure’ I would decide the present case on the narrow ground that, notwithstanding Home Office and Parole Board practice, the applicant should be regarded as equivalent to a discretionary life prisoner for the purpose of deciding whether Wilson rather than Payne governs his case.""",non-argumentative
The court accordingly held that the applicant should be afforded the same opportunity as would be given to a discretionary life prisoner to see the material before the Parole Board when it decided whether he should be released after his recall to prison on revocation of his licence.,non-argumentative
The Parole Board has changed its policy accordingly.,non-argumentative
"However, in a statement in Parliament made on 27 July 1993 (see paragraph 38 below), the Secretary of State, Mr Michael Howard, explained that he included in the category of ""mandatory life sentence prisoners"" those ""persons who are, or will be, detained during HerMajesty’s pleasure under section 53 (1) of the Childrenand Young Persons Act 1933 ...""",non-argumentative

Mr Singh applied to the Commission on 25 January 1994.,non-argumentative

Mr Singh complained that he had not been able either on his recall to prison in 1991 or at reasonable intervals thereafter to have the case of his continued detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure (see paragraph 26 above) heard by a court.,non-argumentative

"""Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest ordetention shall be entitled to take proceedings by whichthe lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedilyby a court and his release ordered if the detention isnot lawful.""",non-argumentative
"The Court will first examine whether, having regard to the particular features of detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, the requirements of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) are satisfied by the original trial and appeal proceedings or, on the contrary, whether that provision confers an additional right to challenge the lawfulness of the continued detention before a court.",non-argumentative
"The Commission agreed in substance with the applicant’s submissions and added that the absence of the word ""life"" in the sentence reinforced its indeterminate character.",non-argumentative
"The Court notes at the outset that, as has been commonly accepted, the central issue in the present case is whether detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure, given its nature and purpose, should be assimilated, under the case-law on the Convention, to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment or rather to a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment.",non-argumentative
"In dealing with this issue the Court must therefore decide whether the substance of a sentence of detention under section 53 is more closely related to that at the heart of the cases of Weeks v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 2 March 1987, Series A no. 114) and Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell (cited above at paragraph 40) or to that in the more recent Wynne case (cited at paragraph 55).",non-argumentative

"The decisive ground for the applicant’s continued detention was and continues to be his dangerousness to society, as the Divisional Court restated on 16 March 1995 (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Prem Singh (no. 2) - see paragraph 24 above), a characteristic susceptible to change with the passage of time.",non-argumentative
"Accordingly, new issues of lawfulness may arise in the course of detention and the applicant is entitled under Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) to take proceedings to have these issues decided by a court at reasonable intervals as well as to have the lawfulness of any re-detention determined by a court (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 76).",non-argumentative
"The Government accepted that if, contrary to their submissions, Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) did confer additional rights to challenge the lawfulness of the applicant’s continued detention, there would have been a breach of that provision but only to the extent that the Parole Board had no general power to order the release of the applicant after the expiry of his tariff.",non-argumentative
"In reply to the applicant’s submission that the importance and the nature of the issue, that is the detainee’s mental state, called for an oral hearing, including the possibility of calling and questioning witnesses, the Government recalled that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not confer an absolute right to an adversarial procedure and that to the extent that fairness did require an oral hearing, this could be secured by bringing judicial review proceedings.",non-argumentative
"The Court recalls that Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) does not guarantee a right to judicial control of such scope as to empower the ""court"" on all aspects of the case, including questions of expediency, to substitute its own discretion for that of the decision-making authority; the review should, nevertheless, be wide enough to bear on those conditions which, according to the Convention, are essential for the lawful detention of a person subject to the special type of deprivation of liberty ordered against the applicant (see, inter alia, the above-mentioned Weeks judgment, p. 29, para. 59, the E. v. Norway judgment of 29 August 1990, Series A no. 181-A, p. 21, para. 50, and the above-mentioned Thynne, Wilson and Gunnell judgment, p. 30, para. 79).",non-argumentative

"The applicant adopted the terms of the claim for compensation in the case of Hussain v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 21 February 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-I, p. 272, para. 65) and, additionally, sought compensation for the ""material and moral damages"" caused by the Parole Board’s failure to recommend his release in the 1991 and 1993 proceedings and by the Secretary of State’s denial of the Parole Board’s recommendation for release in July 1994.",non-argumentative

"It originated in an application (no. 23389/94) against the United Kingdom lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) on 25 January 1994 by a British citizen, Mr Prem Singh.",non-argumentative

"The Parole Board considered the applicant’s case on 27 August and 19 December 1991. It had before it a number of reports from the probation service and the police, none of which was disclosed to the applicant.",non-argumentative
On 19 December 1991 the Board decided against recommending Mr Singh’s immediate release.,non-argumentative
The applicant then sought judicial review (see paragraph 47 below) of the two decisions of the Parole Board of 19 December 1991 and 30 July 1992.,non-argumentative
On 20 April 1993 the Divisional Court quashed the Parole Board’s decision of 19 December 1991 on the ground that there had been a breach of natural justice because of the Board’s failure to disclose to Mr Singh all the reports before it.,non-argumentative
"The court held that the applicant was entitled to a fresh consideration by the Parole Board under the terms of section 39 (4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, at which the Board would be empowered to order (not merely to recommend) his release (see paragraph 43 below).",non-argumentative
"Lord Justice Evans found, inter alia, that: ""[Mr Singh’s] status is that of a person whose continueddetention can only be justified if the test ofdangerousness, meaning an unacceptable risk of physicaldanger to the life or limb of the public, is satisfied""(R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, exparte Prem Singh, unreported, transcript pp. 26F-27B) He further commented that the disclosed facts ""scarcely seem able to support a positive answer to [this question]"".",non-argumentative
All the reports which made a specific recommendation were in favour of the applicant’s release as soon as possible via a pre-release hostel.,non-argumentative
As the applicant was informed on 21 July 1994 the Parole Board unanimously recommended his release subject to six months in a pre-release employment scheme.,non-argumentative
The reasons given were as follows:,non-argumentative
"The Parole Board always counts among its members three High Court judges, three circuit judges and a recorder.",non-argumentative
Cases referred to the Board may be dealt with by three or more members of the Board (Parole Board Rules 1967).,non-argumentative
"The Commission declared the application (no. 23389/94) admissible on 30 June 1994. In its report of 11 October 1994 (Article 31) (art. 31), it expressed the unanimous opinion that there had been a violation of Article 5 para. 4 (art. 5-4) of the Convention.",non-argumentative
