"They refer to the safeguards provided in the Order: no inference may be drawn unless the suspect/accused has been warned in advance of the possible effect; before any inference is drawn, the prosecution must have established a prima facie case against the accused; the judge has a discretion whether to draw an inference and is limited to drawing only such inferences as may be proper.",premise
The Order merely allows the trier of fact to draw such inferences as common sense dictates.,premise
"In the present case, there was a formidable case against the applicant which called for evidence from the applicant if there was an innocent explanation for his conduct.",premise
The burden of proof remained throughout on the prosecution.,premise
The Government submit that the provisions of the 1988 Order did not operate to deprive the applicant either of a fair hearing contrary to Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) or of the presumption of innocence contrary Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2).,conclusion
"As regards the denial of access by the applicant to his solicitor for 48 hours, the Government contend that this delay did not disadvantage the applicant in the conduct of his defence and",premise
therefore discloses no violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.,conclusion
"Since the police have similar powers to delay access in England and Wales,",premise
they submit that there is no discrimination in this respect within the meaning of Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The difference in this respect between the position in England and Wales and that in Northern Ireland, based as it was solely on the geographical location at which a person was arrested and detained,",premise
did not amount to discriminatory treatment within the meaning of Article 14 (Art. 14) of the Convention.,conclusion
"Further, the denial of access by the applicant to his solicitor for 48 hours and the discriminatory practice of not permitting solicitors to be present at any stage while a person arrested under prevention of terrorism provisions is being interviewed,",premise
"The discriminatory element derives, inter alia, from the fact that in England and Wales, contrary to the practice in Northern Ireland, all detained persons, including those detained under prevention of terrorism legislation, are permitted to have their legal representative present during the police interviews.",premise
violates Article 6 (Art. 6) either alone or read in conjunction with Article 14 (Art. 6+14) of the Convention.,conclusion
"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits.",premise
It follows that the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded.,conclusion
As regards the refusal of permission to the applicant's solicitor to be present during his interviews with the police,premise
the Government state that this too did not affect the conduct of the applicant's defence and disclosed no violation of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The applicant submits that the 1988 Order, which permits inferences to be drawn from the failure of an accused to answer police questions or to give evidence, and the reliance placed upon it by the trial judge in the instant case,",premise
The very strong inferences drawn by the trial judge in the applicant's case played a crucial role in his conviction.,premise
"It is submitted that it is a generally recognised principle of international law that an accused person cannot be required to incriminate himself, that Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention enshrines this principle, and that the drawing of an incriminating inference from an accused's failure to give evidence infringes his right to a fair trial.",premise
The applicant also submits that the drawing of an incriminating inference from the failure of an accused person to give evidence has the effect of placing the burden of proof on an accused and is manifestly inconsistent with the presumption of innocence guaranteed in Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention.,premise
violate Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.,conclusion

"the constable informs the person that he so believes, and requests him to account for that presence",non-argumentative
"the person fails or refuses to do so, then if, in any proceedings against the person for the offence, evidence of those matters is given, paragraph (2) applies.",non-argumentative

"the accused's guilt is not in issue, or",non-argumentative
it appears to the court that the physical or mental condition of the accused makes it undesirable for him to be called upon to give evidence;,non-argumentative
"but paragraph (2) does not apply if, before any evidence is called for the defence, the accused or counsel or a solicitor representing him informs the court that the accused will give evidence.",non-argumentative
"Before any evidence is called for the defence, the court",non-argumentative
shall tell the accused that he will be called upon by the court to give evidence in his own defence,non-argumentative

"Acting on the advice of his solicitor and counsel, the applicant chose not to give any evidence.",non-argumentative
"No witnesses were called on the applicant's behalf. Counsel on his behalf, with some support from the evidence of a co-accused, submitted, inter alia, that the applicant's presence in the house just before the police arrived was recent and innocent.",non-argumentative

"""I now turn to consider the fifth count charging the false imprisonment of L. against the accused <the applicant>. For the reasons which I have already stated, I am satisfied that, as L. described in his evidence, <the applicant> was at the top of the stairs pulling the tape out of the cassette after the police arrived outside the house.",non-argumentative
I am further satisfied that it is an irresistible inference that while he was in the house <the applicant> was in contact with the men holding L. captive and that he knew that L. was being held a captive.,non-argumentative
"I also draw very strong inferences against <the applicant> under Article 6 of the 1988 Order by reason of his failure to give an account of his presence in 124 when cautioned by the police on the evening of 7 January 1990 under Article 6, and I also draw very strong inferences against <the applicant> under Article 4 of the 1988 Order by reason of his refusal to give evidence in his own defence when called upon by the Court to do so.",non-argumentative
"Therefore I find <the applicant> guilty of aiding and abetting the false imprisonment of L. because, knowing he was being held captive in the house, he was present in the house concurring in L. being falsely imprisoned.",non-argumentative
"As Vaughan J. stated in R. v. Young 8C and P 644 at 653, 173 ER 655 at 659 cited with approval by Cave J. in R. v. Coney (1882) 8 QBD 534 at 541, <the applicant> was 'near enough to give <his> aid and to give <his> countenance and assistance.'""",non-argumentative
"The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland on the ground, inter alia, that the judge had erred in holding that the words of the Article 6 caution conformed with the requirement that an accused be told in ordinary language what the effect would be if he failed or refused to account for his presence at the scene of a crime.",non-argumentative
The applicant complains that he is the victim of a violation of Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 and Article 14 of the Convention.,non-argumentative

He further complains that he was deprived of access to his solicitor in the first 48 hours of his detention and that his solicitor was not permitted to be present during interviews which took place after that initial period.,non-argumentative
"The latter was in conformity with the practice in Northern Ireland, which differs from that in England and Wales.",non-argumentative
". The applicant invokes Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 and Article 14 (Art. 6-1, 6-2, 14) of the Convention, which provide as relevant:",non-argumentative

No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.,non-argumentative
"I am also satisfied, for the reasons which I have already stated, that <the applicant> was in the house for longer than the short period described by D.M..",non-argumentative
"In its judgment of 7 July 1992, the Court dismissed the applicant's appeal.",non-argumentative
"It held, inter alia:",non-argumentative
"""We consider that there was a formidable case against <the applicant>.",non-argumentative
He was the only one of the accused whom <L.> observed and identified as playing a positive part in the activities touching his captivity. <L.>'s evidence therefore called for an answer.,non-argumentative
