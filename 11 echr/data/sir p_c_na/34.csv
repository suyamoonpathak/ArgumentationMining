"Moreover, up to his placement in public care the third and the fourth applicant were significantly involved in the everyday upbringing of the second applicant.",premise
In these circumstances the decision to place him in public care constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for their family life as ensured by Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.,conclusion

"However, before the County Administrative Court the other applicants gave reason to believe that they would discontinue this therapy if the second applicant's public care were to be revoked.",premise
The Court took this into account when maintaining public care.,premise
"It further considered that implementation of the public care in the third and the fourth applicant's home could lead to a conflict of interests jeopardising the care, given the other applicants' objections to the therapy provided as well as the third and the fourth applicant's belief that the first applicant was innocent.",premise
In the light of the above and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation the Commission finds that the public care of the second applicant has been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that the Swedish courts could reasonably find it necessary to maintain his care.,conclusion

The applicant's request was examined by the Social Council in December 1992.,premise
The applicant's appeal to the County Administrative Court was decided upon in May 1993 following an oral hearing.,premise
"His further appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal was decided upon in September 1993, also after an oral hearing.",premise
Leave to appeal was refused by decision of the Supreme Administrative Court on 26 May 1994.,premise

"In examining whether this interference is justified under para. 2 of Article 8 (Art. 8-2)) the Commission first recalls that the requirement that the interference be ""in accordance with the law"" relates to the quality of the law in question and implies, inter alia, that the law should be accessible to the person concerned, who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him.",premise
"In a sphere covered by written law, the ""law"" is the enactment in force as the competent courts have interpreted it",premise
The Commission notes that under Section 11 of the 1990 Act the Social Council may decide how the public care is to be implemented.,premise

Special arrangements have apparently been made for public holidays.,premise
"Recalling its considerations in para. 7 above as regards the necessity of the public care as implemented in a ""family home"" and having regard to the State's margin of appreciation, the Commission considers that also the access restrictions now complained of have been based on relevant and sufficient reasons and that the Social Council could reasonably find it necessary to order and maintain them.",premise

The Commission's task is to ascertain whether the proceedings in their entirety were fair,premise
"As a general rule, however, it is for the domestic courts to assess the evidence before them, in particular since they have the benefit of hearing witnesses and assessing their credibility",premise
"The Commission is normally not competent to deal with a complaint alleging that errors of law and fact have been committed by domestic courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of any of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or one of its Protocols, for instance in that a judgment has no legal justification and thereby violates a party's right to receive a fair trial (cf. No. 7987/77, Dec. 13.12.79, D.R. 18 pp. 31, 45).",premise
It follows that it cannot examine whether or not the first applicant was guilty or innocent.,conclusion
"The Commission also recalls that under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention it may only deal with a complaint after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules under international law.",premise
A complaint to the Commission must therefore have been made at least in substance in the proceedings before the competent domestic organs,conclusion

"In so far as the complaint has been lodged by the third and the fourth applicant, the Commission recalls that in order for Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) to apply to the proceedings in question it must first be ascertained whether there was a dispute over a ""right"" which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law",premise
Under Swedish law the third and the fourth applicant have no right of access to the second applicant.,premise
"Thus, they cannot, on arguable grounds, claim to have a ""right"" under domestic law.",conclusion
Such an obligation confers upon the applicant a right of a procedural nature distinguishable from the substantive rights set out under Section I of the Convention or under its Protocols.,premise
It flows from the very essence of this right that it must be open to individuals to complain of alleged infringements of it in the proceedings before the Commission.,premise
In this respect the Convention must be interpreted as guaranteeing rights which are practical and effective as opposed to theoretical and illusory,premise
"Recalling its reasoning with regard to complaint no. 13 above, the Commission considers that domestic remedies have not been exhausted. It follows that this complaint must also be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3) of the Convention.",premise
