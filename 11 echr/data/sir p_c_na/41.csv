"They add, in this respect, that although the offence for which the applicant was convicted under Section 99 (1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (refusing to take a breath test) was not, as such, in force on the date of the reservation, the law then in force did impose an obligation on road users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users and to pay such attention as is required for the maintenance of order, safety and traffic efficiency.",premise
The Government consider that the absence of an oral public and direct hearing is covered by the Austrian reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.,premise
They also point out that the applicant did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the Administrative Court.,premise
"They accept, however, that if the reservation does not prevent an examination of the case, then the review of administrative decisions by the Administrative Court and Constitutional Court was not sufficiently wide to comply with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.",conclusion
He agrees that the scope of review by the Constitutional Court and Administrative Court does not comply with Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.,premise
The applicant considers that the Austrian reservation to Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention is neither valid nor applicable in the present case.,conclusion
"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution, the Government consider that, although that provision provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made, the possibility for the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural limitation and not a substantive one.",premise
They point out that any appeal lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to comprehensive review.,premise
"The applicant in this respect considers that the limitation of the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction by Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution does not meet the requirements of the reservation, even if it applies.",premise
"He considers that the reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6), if valid, is not applicable to the present proceedings.",conclusion
"The Commission finds that the application raises complex issues of law under the Convention, including questions concerning the Austrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the Convention, the determination of which must be reserved for an examination on the merits.",premise
The application cannot therefore be declared manifestly ill- founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion

"He also makes specific complaints about the nature of the administrative authorities' examination of the case, including his inability to put questions to prosecution witnesses, and about the inevitably partial status of experts.",non-argumentative
