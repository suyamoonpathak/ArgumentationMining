"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints.",premise

The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.,premise
"An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach.",premise

It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the State invoking the rule,premise

"The Government also submit that alleged arson, destruction of property and threatening conduct are prohibited by the Criminal Code, in respect of which complaints could be lodged with the competent authorities, civil or military.",premise
since the applicants have failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,premise
The Government argue that the application is inadmissible,conclusion
"Any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective since, inter alia, the operation in question in this case was officially organised, planned and executed by agents of the State and having regard, inter alia, to the situation in South-East Turkey which is such that potential applicants have a well-founded fear of the consequences if they should pursue remedies.",premise
"In this context the applicants also allege a lack of genuine investigations by public prosecutors and other competent authorities; the absence of any cases showing the payment of adequate compensation to villagers for the destruction of their homes and villages, or for their expulsion; an official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces and the lack of any prosecutions against members of the security forces for the alleged offences connected with the destruction of villages and forcible expulsions.",premise
"There is, in the applicants' view, an administrative practice of ineffective remedies.",conclusion
"The Commission concludes that this application cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and 27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention.",premise
"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application as a whole.

The applicants give the following account.,non-argumentative
"On 22 October 1993, at around 9h.15, the applicant Biçer was working in his vineyard about 2 kilometres from Lice when a military vehicle passed from the petrol station of Fevzi Çelik, 100 metres from the vineyard.",non-argumentative
There were many soldiers in uniform and two large guns on the vehicle. The applicant Biçer could not see what was happening in Lice but he assumed that something was about to happen.,non-argumentative
At exactly 9h.30 he heard gunshots coming from Lice.,non-argumentative
"Three of the other applicants, Ayder, Lalealp and Doman, had gone to the neighbourhood Saglik café, near their homes.",non-argumentative
"Ayder went there at about 9h.00 and the other two at 7h.00. Just after 9h.00, gendarmes and police entered the café with truncheons and firearms and ordered people to go to their homes because ""the terrorists had organised an attack on the Regiment Command"".",non-argumentative
Lalealp had left the café by that time and was in the Kortik neighbourhood when that was surrounded by soldiers and police and they were told to go to their houses.,non-argumentative
The firing started at around 9h.30.,non-argumentative

The barn began to burn furiously.,non-argumentative
The Lalealp family ran to the barn of the neighbourhood Mayor.,non-argumentative
"The applicant Doman also went into the small barn adjoining his house, accompanied by his family.",non-argumentative
"The applicants did not believe the explanation they had been given because soldiers, gendarmes and police would not have been all over the town if an armed clash had taken place.",non-argumentative
They would have gone into shelters or joined in the fighting because the Regiment Command was only a few hundred metres from the city centre.,non-argumentative
"Furthermore, the PKK has never been known to launch attacks during the day.",non-argumentative
They attack at night and withdraw.,non-argumentative
"In the meantime, when the firing started, Biçer took refuge in a ""göm"" (a hole big enough for 10 people to shelter in and covered with sheet iron).",non-argumentative

All those who emerged from shelters in Lice were told to go to the open space in front of the Security Directorate.,non-argumentative
About 2.000 people were gradually gathered together there.,non-argumentative
They were made to wait for about four hours for the arrival of the Diyarbakir provincial governor at around 12h.00-12h.30.,non-argumentative
The provincial governor said that they were sheltering terrorists in their homes and that the attack was the work of those terrorists.,non-argumentative
If they saw any terrorists they were to telephone the authorities.,non-argumentative
A man of about 40-45 years old stood up and said that soldiers and police had caused the destruction.,non-argumentative

"They then settled in the house of his sister-in-law, who had left Lice.",non-argumentative
"A month after the incident, he applied to the prosecutor for a determination of damage.",non-argumentative
He was told by Council workers to open a court case with the help of the Municipal Council.,non-argumentative
"He did not do so because he thought that it would be without effect, since no one has been known to have achieved any results through any such application.",non-argumentative
He was not given a copy of the damage determination form.,non-argumentative
"The applicant is too old to work and there is no work to be found in Lice, whose population has gone down by half since this incident.",non-argumentative

Relevant domestic law and practice,non-argumentative
Civil and administrative procedures,non-argumentative
Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:,non-argumentative
(translation),non-argumentative
"""All acts or decisions of the Administration are subject to judicial review ...",non-argumentative
"The Administration shall be liable for damage caused by its own acts and measures.""",non-argumentative
The Government assert that this provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war.,non-argumentative
"The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the Administration, whose liability is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a theory of ""social risk"".",non-argumentative
"Thus the Administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.",non-argumentative
"The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional Article 1 of Law 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides:",non-argumentative
(translation),non-argumentative
"""... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this law are to be brought against the Administration before the administrative courts.""",non-argumentative

"to oblige someone through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act (Article 188),",non-argumentative
"to issue threats (Article 191),",non-argumentative
"to make an unlawful search of someone's home (Articles 193 and 194),",non-argumentative
"to commit arson (Articles 369, 370, 371, 372) or aggravated arson if human life is endangered (Article 382),",non-argumentative
"to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or inexperience (Article 383), or",non-argumentative
to damage another's property intentionally (Article 526 et seq.).,non-argumentative
"For all these offences, complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities.",non-argumentative
"The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.",non-argumentative
"If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code.",non-argumentative
"Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons' hierarchical superior (Articles 93 and 95 of Law 353 on the Constitution and the Procedure of Military Courts).",non-argumentative
"If the alleged author of a crime is a State official or civil servant, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils.",non-argumentative
The local council decisions may be appealed to the State Council; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind.,non-argumentative
Articles 13 to 15 of the Constitution provide for fundamental limitations on constitutional safeguards.,non-argumentative
Provisional Article 15 of the Constitution provides that there can be no allegation of unconstitutionality in respect of measures taken under laws or decrees having the force of law and enacted between 12 September 1980 and 25 October 1983.,non-argumentative
"That includes Law 2935 on the State of Emergency of 25 October 1983, under which decrees have been issued which are immune from judicial challenge.",non-argumentative
"Extensive powers have been granted to the Regional Governor of the State of Emergency by such decrees, especially Decree 285, as amended by Decrees 424 and 425, and Decree 430.",non-argumentative
"Decree 285 modifies the application of Law 3713, the Anti-Terror Law (1981), in those areas subject to the state of emergency, with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils.",non-argumentative
Article 8 of Decree 430 of 16 December 1990 provides as follows:,non-argumentative
"No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the State of Emergency Regional Governor or a Provincial Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end.",non-argumentative
This is without prejudice to the rights of an individual to claim indemnity from the State for damages suffered by them without justification.,non-argumentative
The applicants allege that they have been the victims of the following violations of the Convention:,non-argumentative
A violation of Article 2 on account of the life-threatening attack to which they were subjected by agents of the State.,non-argumentative
"Alternatively, a violation of Article 2 on account of the threat to life occasioned by gross recklessness on the parts of agents of the State, in violation of the State's obligation to protect their right to life.",non-argumentative
A violation of Article 2 on account of the lack of any effective system for ensuring protection of the right to life.,non-argumentative
A violation of Article 2 on account of the inadequate protection of the right to life in domestic law.,non-argumentative
A violation of Article 14 in conjunction with each head of claim under Article 2.,non-argumentative
"A violation of Article 3 on account of an inhuman and degrading treatment whilst firing was going on, in front of the Security Directorate and whilst they were subject to the curfew.",non-argumentative
"This represents a form of collective punishment which is, in itself, in violation of Article 3.",non-argumentative
"A violation of Article 14, in conjunction with Article 3.",non-argumentative
A violation of Article 3 on account of discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin.,non-argumentative
A violation of Article 5 on account of complete lack of security of the person.,non-argumentative
"A violation of Article 6 on account of the impossibility of challenging the deprivation of property before it took place, which represents a denial of access to court for a determination of civil rights.",non-argumentative
"A violation of Article 6 on account of the failure to initiate proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal against those responsible for the life-threatening attacks and destruction of property, as a result of which they cannot bring civil proceedings out of the attack and destruction.",non-argumentative
A violation of Article 8 on account of the destruction of the homes of the applicants.,non-argumentative
A violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 on account of the destruction of the applicants' homes and possessions.,non-argumentative
"A violation of Article 14, in conjunction with Articles 5, 6 and 8 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol 1 on account of an administrative practice of discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin.",non-argumentative
A violation of Article 13 on account of the lack of any independent national authority before which these complaints can be brought with any prospect of success.,non-argumentative
A violation of Article 18 because the interferences in the exercise of the Convention rights are not designed to secure the ends permitted under the Convention.,non-argumentative
The applicants maintain that there is no requirement that they pursue alleged domestic remedies.,non-argumentative
"According to them, any alleged remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective because",non-argumentative
"the operation which led to the threat of life and destruction in question in this case was officially organised, planned and executed by agents of the State;",non-argumentative
there is an administrative practice of not respecting the rule under Article 13 of the Convention which requires the provision of effective domestic remedies;,non-argumentative
"whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic remedies are ineffective in this case owing to the failure of the legal system to provide redress;",non-argumentative
"alternatively, the applicants have done everything they can to exhaust domestic remedies by obtaining a determination of damage; the fact that none of them has received any compensation or assistance confirms the ineffectiveness of any alleged remedy.",non-argumentative
The application was introduced on 20 April 1994 and registered on 9 May 1994.,non-argumentative
"On 27 June 1994, the Commission decided to communicate the application to the Government and to ask for written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case.",non-argumentative
The Government's observations were submitted on 5 December 1994 after one extension in the time-limit set for that purpose.,non-argumentative
The Government submitted supplementary observations on 25 January 1995.,non-argumentative
The applicant's observations in reply were submitted on 21 February 1995.,non-argumentative
The applicants complain that the security forces carried out a life-threatening attack on their town during which their homes and property were burnt and destroyed.,non-argumentative
"They invoke Article 2 (Art. 2) (the right to life), Article 3 (Art. 3) (the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment), Article 5 (Art. 5) (the right to liberty and security of person), Article 6 (Art. 6) (the right of access to court), Article 8 (Art. 8) (the right to respect for family life and the home), Article 13 (Art. 13) (the right to effective national remedies for Convention breaches), Article 14 (Art. 14) (prohibition on discrimination) and Article 18 (Art. 18) (the prohibition on using authorised Convention restrictions for ulterior purposes) of the Convention, as well as Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention (the right to property).",non-argumentative
"As regards the allegations with regard to the destruction of the applicants' homes and property, the Commission refers to its findings in Application No. 21893/93, Akdivar and others v. Turkey (Dec. 19.10.94) which concerned similar complaints of the destruction of homes and forcible expulsion.",non-argumentative
"In that case, the Commission noted that it was a known fact that there had been destruction of villages in South-East Turkey with many people displaced as a result.",non-argumentative
"While the Government had outlined a general scheme of remedies that would normally be available for complaints against the security forces, the Commission found it significant that, although the destruction of houses and property has been a frequent occurrence in South-East Turkey, the Government had not provided a single example of compensation being awarded to villagers for damage like that suffered by the applicants.",non-argumentative
