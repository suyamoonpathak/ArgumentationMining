"The Commission observes that the Inter-Parliamentary Union is an association of parliamentarians from all over the world, set up inter alia to unite parliamentarians in common action and to advance international peace and cooperation.",premise
The Union is a non-governmental organisation.,premise
The organs of the Union may adopt resolutions which are communicated by the parliamentarians concerned to the national parliaments and to international organisations.,premise
The Commission has examined the meaning and scope of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.,premise
"It considers that the term ""another procedure"" refers to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention.",premise
"Moreover, the term ""international investigation or settlement"" refers to institutions and procedures set up by States, thus excluding non-governmental bodies.",premise
"The Commission considers that the Inter-Parliamentary Union constitutes a non-governmental organisation, whereas Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) refers to inter-governmental institutions and procedures.",premise
"It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union do not constitute ""another procedure of international investigation or settlement"" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.",conclusion
Reference is made for instance to the seizure of the applicant's passport; the decision of the Public Prosecutor of 12 August 1992 prohibiting the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers; the Public Prosecutor's order of 1 September 1992 prohibiting the applicant from seeing other persons; and the period of the applicant's detention up to 7 September 1992.,premise
The Government submit that a number of complaints raised by the applicant are outside the Commission's competence ratione temporis.,conclusion
"The Commission recalls, on the one hand, that with effect from 7 September 1992 Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the Commission's competence under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention to receive individual petitions.",premise
It follows that any complaints about facts occurring prior to 7 September 1992 are incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
"On the other hand, insofar as the facts complained of relate to the period after 7 September 1992, the application cannot be declared inadmissible as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.",premise
"However, the applicant's various complaints raise different issues in respect of the Commission's competence ratione temporis.",premise
"The Commission will therefore duly examine its competence when dealing with the individual complaints. c) In respect of the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, the applicant points out that the Supreme Court on 13 July 1992 dealt in the last resort with his appeal against detention.",conclusion
"It is submitted that the applicant filed his application with the Commission on 1 September 1992, i.e. two months before 16 November 1992, the date on which the final decision on the matter had been notified to the applicant and on which consequently all domestic remedies had been exhausted.",premise
"Under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention ""the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken"".",premise
The Government maintain that the applicant has not complied with the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,conclusion
The Commission notes that the Supreme Court in the final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992.,premise
The applicant then filed his submissions with the Commission on 1 and 8 September 1992.,premise
"On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further appeal, though the Court stated that it was possible to file a complaint with the Prosecutor General.",premise
The applicant filed an appeal with the Prosecutor General which the latter dismissed on 11 November 1992.,premise
"Within six months of this date, i.e. on 7 May 1993, the applicant submitted his application form to the Commission.",premise
The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also complied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,conclusion
The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also complied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,premise
It follows that the application can also not be declared inadmissible on these grounds.,conclusion
"The Commission recalls that any complaints about facts relating to a period prior to 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, are incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",premise
"In the present case, it is true that the Supreme Court in the final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, i.e. before 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
"After the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant on 10 November 1992 filed a request for release from detention on remand which the Prosecutor General dismissed on 11 November 1992 on the ground that there were no new circumstances justifying modification of detention.",premise
"Rather, the acts of which he was accused concerned collective decisions of the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria over the period 1986-1989. Those decisions were taken within the constitutional powers of the Council of Ministers, and in accordance with the policies of the Bulgarian Government and the recommendations of the United Nations and their agencies.",conclusion
"In his view, confirmation herefor can be seen in the decision of 12 August 1992 which banned meetings between the applicant and his lawyers, thereby indicating that the true purpose of his detention was to restrict his right actively and freely to express his political views as a member of the National Assembly.",premise
The applicant also invokes Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention in that the purpose of his detention was political and did not correspond to the grounds listed under Bulgarian law.,conclusion
The Government submit that extending aid to Third World countries is not an offence under Bulgarian law.,premise
"However, this is not the correct formulation of the grounds in respect of which charges were brought against the applicant and other persons.",premise
"Rather, the charges were that, under the cover of development assistance, monies had been transferred in different ""deals"" which infringed Bulgaria's economic interests.",conclusion
"The Government also refer in this context to the Convention organs' case-law, in particular the Bozano case, according to which, where the Convention refers back to domestic law as in Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c), the Convention organs' supervisory powers are limited since it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Eur. Court H.R., judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 25, para. 58).",premise
"The Government submit that the applicant's detention served no other purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention.",premise
"The domestic authorities strictly apply Bulgarian law equally to all persons, including the applicant.",conclusion
"He complains in particular that the authorities refused to take into account the recommendations of various medical experts; as a result, his health seriously deteriorated.",premise
"For instance, he suffered stenocardiac arrests and had worse basic indicators of his blood count.",premise
Twice he had to undergo treatment in the intensive care unit at the Sofia Military Hospital.,premise
He was sent to the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital despite the danger of infections posing a risk to his health and life.,premise
The applicant complains under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention of inhuman and degrading treatment which he allegedly suffered while remanded in custody.,conclusion
The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,premise
"Thus, it was impossible for him to meet relatives or members of his parliamentary group and of human rights organisations, and contacts with his lawyers were restricted.",conclusion
"The Commission notes that before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, medical reports were issued on the applicant's health between 18 and 28 August 1992.",premise
"Thereafter, further reports were issued on 16 September 1992 and on 2 October 1992.",premise
"These reports were prepared by numerous medical experts, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist.",premise
"It transpires from these reports that the applicant suffered from malignant chronic lympholeucosis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart.",premise
"While the applicant had apparently suffered from angina pectoris, there was no sign of a myocardial infarct.",premise
"While the applicant's state of ill-health was serious, the Commission considers that his ailments were due to disorders which were mainly of a long-lasting nature.",conclusion
"In particular, a problem could arise under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention if no, or only insufficient, treatment was available to him.",premise
"On 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant was transferred from the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital to the National Investigation Service.",premise
"However, following a deterioration of his cardiovascular condition on 10 and 11 September 1992, he was taken to the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.",premise
In the medical report of 16 September 1992 it was found that the applicant should take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital environment.,premise
The report of 2 October 1992 recommended certain medication and a convalescence period of three weeks under medical supervision at a hospital.,premise
"As a result, the applicant remained at the Higher Military Medical Institute until 30 November 1992 when he returned to the National Investigation Service.",premise
"A week later, when his health deteriorated, he was again taken to the Higher Military Medical Institute.",premise
On 30 December 1992 he was released from detention.,premise
"The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was monitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their recommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required medical treatment.",conclusion
"The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was monitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their recommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required medical treatment.",premise
"Indeed, after 7 September 1992 most of his detention was spent in hospital.",premise
At one stage he was even brought to the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.,premise
"Insofar as the applicant submits that he risked infection, inter alia at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, he has not alleged that he was brought into close contact with persons suffering from contagious diseases, and indeed, it does not transpire that he was infected with any particular illness while in hospital.",premise
They continuously reviewed the detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's health as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,premise
"On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the applicant's state of ill-health.",conclusion
"On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the applicant's state of ill-health.",premise
As a result the Commission considers that the manner in which the applicant underwent detention does not constitute treatment attaining the minimum level of severity falling within the scope of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention that the Supreme Court, when considering his appeal on 13 July 1992, decided in camera without the applicant or other persons being present.",premise
"However, the fact complained of relates to a period prior to 7 September 1992 on which date the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
This part of the application is therefore incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2).,conclusion
The Commission notes that the proceedings instituted against the applicant have not yet been terminated.,premise
"He has not, therefore, been ""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1 (Art. 7-1) of the Convention.",conclusion
"He has not, therefore, been ""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1 (Art. 7-1) of the Convention.",premise
"The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.",conclusion
"The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.",premise
This part of the application is therefore manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The applicant refers here in particular to the Public Prosecutor's order of 12 August 1992 which, as a result of the applicant's article published on 11 August 1992, prohibited him from transmitting written materials to his lawyers.",premise
The prohibition was renewed in November 1992.,premise
The applicant submits that the order of 12 August 1992 was fully carried into effect until the end of August and in early September 1992.,premise
Under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention the applicant complains that during detention he was prohibited from writing articles on issues irrelevant to the subject of the investigations.,conclusion
"In fact, there was no prohibition, only a limitation of the applicant's contacts with his lawyers.",premise
"While in detention the applicant wrote altogether 26 substantial newspaper articles, seven of which appeared after 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
He also wrote a book which was published after his release.,premise
The Government submit that the restrictions of the applicant's freedom of expression corresponded to the requirements of detention.,conclusion
The Commission notes the applicant's submissions that this prohibition had its effects in August and in early September 1992.,premise
"In the Commission's opinion, the applicant has not sufficiently established any interferences with his right to freedom of expression after 7 September 1992, which is the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
This aspect of the application is therefore incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
"(see No. 9044/80, Chartier v. Italy, Comm. Report 8.12.92, D.R. 33, p. 41 et seq., at p. 58).",premise
"Indeed, when preparing their reports, the experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health of the years 1988-1990.",premise
It has therefore not sufficiently been made out that the applicant's ailments arose as the direct consequence of his detention,conclusion
"It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union do not constitute ""another procedure of international investigation or settlement"" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.",premise
"Accordingly, the present application cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention. b) In respect of the Commission's competence ratione temporis to examine his application, the applicant submits that, while the facts complained of originated before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date when Bulgaria ratified the Convention, the situation complained of continued after the Convention had entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.",conclusion
"The applicant, a Bulgarian citizen born in 1938, was first a Minister of the Bulgarian Government, then Deputy Prime Minister, and as from 1989 until 1990 Prime Minister of Bulgaria.",non-argumentative
He is currently a member of the Bulgarian National Assembly.,non-argumentative
"On 9 March 1992 the authorities seised the applicant's passport with reference to Section 7 para. (d) of the Bulgarian Passport Act (for all references to Bulgarian law see below, Relevant domestic law).",non-argumentative
The applicant filed an appeal on which the authorities have so far not decided.,non-argumentative
On 1 July 1992 the Prosecutor General requested the Bulgarian National Assembly to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of having contravened Section 203 of the Bulgarian Penal Code.,non-argumentative
"He was in particular accused of having participated between 1986 and 1990 as a Deputy Prime Minister in 27 decisions which granted assistance and credits of altogether 34.594.500 USD and 27.072.000 convertible Bulgarian Leva to less developed countries such as Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos and others.",non-argumentative
"The decisions ... have led to extremely severe results for the country's economy in respect of its potential, resources and export capacity, and have objectively led to an incapacity to repay its foreign debt.",non-argumentative
"It should be emphasised that due to such decisions harmful to the country, and other illegal acts of party and government leaders, during this period our foreign debt which in 1986 amounted to 4.119.700 USD, increased to 10.656.900.000 USD in 1989 ...",non-argumentative
"The described situation corresponds to the qualification of the crime of the 'benefit of using one's position' in respect of particularly big amounts, which qualifies as a specifically severe case, falling under Section 203 and Section 219 para. 3 of the Penal Code.",non-argumentative
"The crimes mentioned are 'serious' in the context of Section 93 para. 7 of the same Code.""",non-argumentative
"On 7 July 1992 the National Assembly decided to suspend the applicant's parliamentary immunity and to permit the institution of criminal proceedings against him, as well as his arrest and detention on remand.",non-argumentative
"On 9 July 1992 Public Prosecutor D., of the Investigation Department of the General Prosecution, ordered the applicant's prosecution and his detention on remand.",non-argumentative
The order reiterated the grounds for the initiation of criminal proceedings as stated in the Prosecutor General's request to the National Assembly of 1 July 1992.,non-argumentative
"As to the reasons for imposing detention on remand, it relied on the extent of public exposure of the committed crime, the personality of the performer and the need to secure the applicant's appearance before court, as well as on Sections 50, 177, 180, 196 para. 2 and 207, and Sections 146 to 148 and 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",non-argumentative
"The applicant's prosecution was further ordered in connection with Sections 201, 202 para. 1 (1) and 282 para. 3 of the Penal Code.",non-argumentative
Still on 9 July 1992 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on the premises of the National Investigation Service in Sofia.,non-argumentative
"The applicant was represented by various lawyers who, at least until 12 August 1992, had the right to speak with him alone (see below, IV.).",non-argumentative
"On 9 July 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed an appeal with the Bulgarian Supreme Court, requesting the applicant's release from detention.",non-argumentative
"The appeal stated that, contrary to Section 148 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the warrant of arrest mentioned no grounds for the applicant's arrest.",non-argumentative
The grounds given could in fact serve for any arrest.,non-argumentative
"Furthermore, according to Section 152 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it did not suffice if the detention was justified on the ground that the applicant risked a sentence of more than ten years' imprisonment, since para. 2 of Section 152 required as grounds for detention a danger of absconding or of committing a further crime.",non-argumentative
The appeal also invoked Section 31 para. 4 of the Bulgarian Constitution.,non-argumentative
On 13 July 1992 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.,non-argumentative
"The Court decided in the presence of the Public Prosecutor, but in the absence of the applicant and his lawyers.",non-argumentative
"The decision stated: ""Under Section 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure detention is ordered if a sentence of ten or more years of imprisonment or the death penalty is envisaged for the crime",non-argumentative
The offences in Section 203 para. 1 of the Penal Code envisage such a penalty.,non-argumentative
(This provision) contains two cumulative prerequisites - misappropriation must have occurred on a large scale and must have been particularly serious.,non-argumentative
The particularly large scale derives from the nominal value of the public property involved.,non-argumentative
The seriousness of the case results from the fact that the misappropriation was done in complicity with other persons and from the extremely high degree of public danger of the act and the subject (Section 93 para. 8 of the Penal Code).,non-argumentative
The argument that the hypothesis of Section 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applies in this case is groundless.,non-argumentative
At the time of the accusation the applicant was a member of the National Assembly.,non-argumentative
He preserves this quality by virtue of Section 72 of the Constitution of Bulgaria up to the moment when judicial facts occurred by virtue of which the powers of a member of the National Assembly may be suspended.,non-argumentative
In his capacity as member of the National Assembly the applicant represents the people as a whole.,non-argumentative
It is precisely in this capacity that the possibility of Section 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applying to his case becomes more likely than in the case of an applicant who does not have the status of a member of the National Assembly.,non-argumentative
"Furthermore, the applicant undertook a judicial appeal against the administrative act by which his diplomatic passport ... was withdrawn ...",non-argumentative
These actions of his cast well-founded doubts as to whether future actions will not be undertaken by him in the context of Section 152 para. 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.,non-argumentative
According to Section 70 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria '... the members of the National Assembly cannot be detained and no legal prosecution can be initiated against them except for serious crimes and with the permission of the National Assembly ...'.,non-argumentative
"The logical and systematic interpretation of the aforesaid provision imposes the conclusion that the measure of restriction, 'detention', in the context of the Penal Code is determined by the high level of public danger of the act and by the special status of the person who has committed it and is the subject of the crime, a member of the National Assembly.",non-argumentative
"For this reason the legislator envisaged a qualified measure of restriction, detention, in similar cases.",non-argumentative
"The Prosecutor's Office is competent to impose this measure.""",non-argumentative
On 4 September 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed a request with the Prosecutor General to be released from detention.,non-argumentative
"Alleging a change in circumstances concerning the applicant's state of health and with reference to Article 3 of the Convention, the lawyer complained of the insufficient conditions of the premises where the applicant was detained, in particular as other people at the hospital suffered from contagious diseases and he was obliged to share cutlery and use common toilets.",non-argumentative
"Reference was made in particular to the reports of the medical experts (see below, C. Applicant's state of health) according to which such conditions constituted a considerable risk for the applicant's health.",non-argumentative
The applicant apparently did not receive a reply.,non-argumentative
On 5 September 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed a complaint with the Supreme Court against the tacit refusal of the Prosecutor General to grant the request of 4 September 1992.,non-argumentative
Under Article 6 of the Convention a public hearing on the applicant's appeal was requested.,non-argumentative
On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal as the law did not provide for judicial control over the acts of the prosecution during the preliminary investigation of a criminal case.,non-argumentative
The sole exception to this rule was the possibility to appeal against an order for the imposition of detention.,non-argumentative
"Besides, the Supreme Court had already dealt with the applicant's appeal against his detention, and under the law the imposition of detention could only be contested once.",non-argumentative
A new appeal was only possible where a detained person had been released and then again detained.,non-argumentative
"However, this was within the competence of the investigating authorities, whose decisions could be contested before the prosecution, albeit not before the court.",non-argumentative
"Based on the conclusions of the medical experts (see below, C. Applicant's state of health) the applicant's lawyer, on 20 October 1992, requested Public Prosecutor D. to release the applicant.",non-argumentative
On 28 October 1992 Public Prosecutor D. met the applicant and a lawyer at Sofia hospital.,non-argumentative
"According to the minutes established, the lawyer requested D., who was conducting the investigation, to decide on the applicant's request for release.",non-argumentative
The applicant himself pointed out that it was absurd to rely for his detention on the fact that he had complained about the withdrawal of his passport.,non-argumentative
He also did not have another passport.,non-argumentative
"There was no danger of repeating the offence, as he was no longer in a position to do so.",non-argumentative
"As a result, his release was imperative.",non-argumentative
The applicant also drew attention to the necessity of convalescence which was impossible in detention.,non-argumentative
"It was stated that the applicant's lawyers had been informed of the Prosecutor General's decision of 22 October 1992, and that no further appeal was possible.",non-argumentative
The order explained that the Prosecutor General was aware of the medical reports and had refused the request as there were no new circumstances permitting the applicant's release.,non-argumentative
"By letter of 9 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer requested the General Prosecution to terminate the investigations, explaining that the investigations had commenced on 8 July 1992, and that the two months of investigations envisaged by the law had expired on 8 September 1992.",non-argumentative
"After prolongation, on 8 November 1992 a period of four months had expired.",non-argumentative
"According to Section 222 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a further prolongation of two months was only possible in ""exceptional"" cases.",non-argumentative
The lawyer contested the exceptional nature of the applicant's case as in the past four months the General Prosecution had not obtained new means of proof.,non-argumentative
The lawyer also contested that the accusations disclosed an offence.,non-argumentative
"Thus, the decisions of the Council of Ministers had been taken collectively within the framework of the constitutional powers and the budget voted by the National Assembly; the decisions executed State policies during the period concerned; the authority as such, and not the applicant as Deputy Prime Minister, had dealt with the means concerned and it had not been established that the applicant had committed the offence in his own or another person's interest.",non-argumentative
On 10 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer requested the Prosecutor General to release the applicant as the further prolongation breached Article 5 para. 3 of the Convention; contrary to Article 5 para. 1 (c) of the Convention no grounds had been given for detention.,non-argumentative
"The lawyer refused to comment on the allegation that, as a member of the National Assembly, the applicant was particularly dangerous. On the other hand, insofar as it was maintained that the applicant had appealed against the refusal to apply for a passport, he had only employed his rights under Bulgarian law.",non-argumentative
The lawyer further invoked Articles 2 and 5 para. 4 of the Convention; under Article 6 para. 3 (b) the lawyer complained that the applicant had not been informed of the content of the accusations against him.,non-argumentative
On 11 November 1992 the Prosecutor General orally informed the applicant's lawyers that the applicant's request of 10 November 1992 had been dismissed as there were no new circumstances justifying modification of detention.,non-argumentative
"According to the Public Prosecutor's subsequent letter of 25 November 1992, a copy of this decision was transmitted on 16 November 1992 to the applicant's lawyer.",non-argumentative
On 18 November 1992 the applicant personally wrote a letter to the Prosecutor General complaining about the proceedings.,non-argumentative
He invoked Section 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure according to which the Prosecution had to reply to requests in writing.,non-argumentative
The applicant concluded that the criminal proceedings instituted against him had no legal basis and constituted an overt political reprisal.,non-argumentative
By letter of 20 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer asked Public Prosecutor D. about the outcome of the request of 10 November 1992.,non-argumentative
She explained that the information was important for the application filed with the European Commission of Human Rights.,non-argumentative
"On 25 November 1992 Public Prosecutor D. replied that on 16 November 1992 the decision of 11 November 1992 had been transmitted to the applicant's lawyer, and that minutes concerning these occurrences had been prepared under Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.",non-argumentative
"On 29 December 1992 the Bulgarian National Assembly reversed its decision of 7 July 1992 (see above, I.) authorising the applicant's detention on remand. On 30 December 1992 Prosecutor D. issued an order for the applicant's release whereupon the applicant was released.",non-argumentative
On 6 August 1992 the Public Prosecutor ordered the applicant's examination by a panel of medical experts.,non-argumentative
As from 10 August 1992 the applicant underwent medical examinations at the Sofia Higher Medical Academy.,non-argumentative
The medical experts submitted their conclusions in four reports between 18 and 28 August 1992.,non-argumentative
The experts relied inter alia on previous reports on the applicant's health of the years 1988-1990.,non-argumentative
"According to these reports, the applicant suffered from malignant chronic lymphocytic leucaemia, hypertensive disease and chronic ischemic heart disease with stable stenocardia.",non-argumentative
The applicant was detained in a cell without fresh air or natural lighting.,non-argumentative
"It was stated that the applicant required inter alia accommodation in premises with sufficient fresh air and natural light, and that stress situations were counter-indicated.",non-argumentative
The premises of the National Investigation Service were inadequate.,non-argumentative
"If the applicant was taken to Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, the latter could offer a general capacity for treating a wide range of diseases; however, it could not be stated with certainty whether full prevention of contacts with persons having different kinds of infections could be prevented.",non-argumentative
"On the other hand, since his chronic diseases were not in an aggravated stage, it was unnecessary for the applicant to stay in hospital.",non-argumentative
On 20 August 1992 Public Prosecutor D. issued an order in which he confirmed the applicant's detention at the National Investigation Service.,non-argumentative
"The order, which stated that an appeal could be filed against it, explained inter alia:",non-argumentative
"""The chronic lympholeukosis is in its initial clinical phase (zero) and there are no indications of its progress or deterioration.",non-argumentative
Experts are firm in their conclusion that this disease does not call for medical treatment.,non-argumentative
The arterial hypertension fluctuates and is easily susceptible to control through small doses of beta-blockers.,non-argumentative
"There are no indications or signs of coronary insufficiency, disturbances of the heart rhythm or cardiac problems.",non-argumentative
The results of the medical tests show that medicaments have stabilised the (applicant's) health condition.,non-argumentative
The hygienic requirements and the dietetic regime prescribed by the experts should be observed.,non-argumentative
"Regular check-ups by a cardiologist and haematologist are called for, and, if necessary, a control by a gastroenterologist.",non-argumentative
"As is seen from the above, (the applicant's) health condition does not call for modification of the detention ordered on 7 July 1992.",non-argumentative
The medical facilities at the National Investigation Service of the Ministry for the Interior are in a position to provide the treatment and medicaments in the outpatients' ward.,non-argumentative
Arrangements have also been made with the Higher Military Medical Institute and the experts for regular medical examination.,non-argumentative
"The living conditions in the arrest premises of the National Investigation Service correspond to the hygienic requirements.""",non-argumentative
On 25 August 1992 the applicant's lawyer filed an appeal claiming that the order directly endangered the applicant's health and life.,non-argumentative
"Thus, the National Investigation Service did not provide premises free from stress, complying with the hygienic requirements, offering fresh air, food rich in vitamins and the possibility of walks in the open.",non-argumentative
The applicant apparently did not receive a reply to this appeal.,non-argumentative
On 25 August 1992 the applicant was taken to the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital.,non-argumentative

"As a result, he should remain under medical supervision, his state of health being stable.",non-argumentative
On 16 September 1992 a medical expert commission issued a report on the applicant's health.,non-argumentative
"The commission was composed of eight doctors, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist.",non-argumentative
"It found that the applicant suffered from high blood pressure, calling for beta- blockers and small doses of calcium.",non-argumentative
"Moreover, the applicant had apparently suffered from crises of angina pectoris, particularly at night.",non-argumentative
"On the other hand, there was no sign of a myocardial infarct.",non-argumentative
The Report proposed that the applicant take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital environment.,non-argumentative
On 17 September 1992 the Head of the Higher Military Medical Institute reiterated these conclusions in a letter to the Public Prosecutor.,non-argumentative
The applicant remained at the Higher Military Medical Institute.,non-argumentative

Reference was made in particular to Section 75 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.,non-argumentative
The order which stated that it could be contested by means of appeal explained:,non-argumentative
"""The daily papers and in particular the 'Douma' newspaper after the date of detention of the accused ... published articles by him. Such an article was also published in No. 191/ August 8 1992 of the said newspaper.",non-argumentative
Analysis has shown that these publications are of a political nature.,non-argumentative
"One of the aims of these publications is to demonstrate that, irrespective of his detention, the <applicant> continues to take an active part in the public and political life of the country.",non-argumentative
This is inadmissible in view of the measure of coercion applied to him.,non-argumentative
"Thus, public order is being infringed, mistrust of the judiciary is being introduced, and the constitutional principle that rights should not be abused has been violated.",non-argumentative
"According to Section 10 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all citizens participating in criminal proceedings are equal before the law and in this connection no privileges based on public status are admitted.",non-argumentative

"There are reasons to suspect that irrespective of the oral warnings addressed to the <applicant> according to the conditions of arrest, he is preparing written material which he transmits to his defence lawyers at his meetings with them, when no one else is present, under Section 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and which are then conveyed to the editorial boards of newspapers and other organisations.",non-argumentative
This aims at introducing public unrest and mistrust of the Bulgarian Judiciary.,non-argumentative
"Thus, it is necessary, provisionally, during the stay of the <applicant> at the ... Higher Medical Academy, to restrict his right to meet with his defence lawyers without anyone else being present, as provided for under Section 75 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.""",non-argumentative
"On 1 September 1992 Public Prosecutor D. issued a further order according to which the applicant, who was now in the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, was not permitted to ""see other persons, including members of the family, members of the National Assembly, or his lawyers, without permission in writing given under my signature.",non-argumentative

Under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention the applicant complains that he was prohibited from writing articles while in detention.,non-argumentative
The Government have raised various objections to the admissibility of the application.,non-argumentative
"They contend that the applicant has submitted his complaints to another procedure of international investigation or settlement within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 17-1-b) of the Convention, namely the Inter-Parliamentary Union; that part of the application is incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention; and that the applicant has not complied with the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.",non-argumentative
"In respect of the conditions set out in Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention the applicant submits that he did not initiate the proceedings before the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and that the complaints dealt with by that institution were different from those raised before the Commission.",non-argumentative
"The Government contend that the Inter-Parliamentary Union has been seised of the same issues as are now before the Commission, and that it is irrelevant under Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention whether or not the decisions of such institutions have any binding effect; in any event, the resolutions of the Inter- Parliamentary Union have great political weight.",non-argumentative
The Government refer here as an example to the outcome of the proceedings before the Human Rights Committee established under the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.,non-argumentative
"In the Government's view, it is also irrelevant whether or not the institution concerned is inter-governmental.",non-argumentative
"According to Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention ""the Commission shall not deal with any petition ... which ... has already been submitted to another procedure of international investigation or settlement ..."".",non-argumentative
"The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows:",non-argumentative
"In the present case, the Human Rights Committee of the Inter- Parliamentary Union examined in particular the conditions of the applicant's detention.",non-argumentative
"On 12 September 1992, at the 88th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Council, the Committee issued a Report on the applicant's case.",non-argumentative
The matter is still under consideration by the Union.,non-argumentative
On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further appeal.,non-argumentative
"The applicant's request of 10 November 1992 for release from detention was dismissed by the Prosecutor General on 11 November 1992, the applicant's lawyer being served with the decision on 16 November 1992.",non-argumentative
By submitting his claims on 8 September 1992 and an application form on 7 May 1993 the applicant complied in particular with the six months' rule under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
The applicant complains that when he was arrested and detained on remand there was no reasonable suspicion of him having committed a crime within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
He further complains that no grounds were given as to the necessity of his arrest and detention in order to prevent him from committing an offence or fleeing after having done so within the meaning of Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
The applicant also invokes Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c) of the Convention states:,non-argumentative
Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.,non-argumentative
No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:,non-argumentative
"the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so; ..."".",non-argumentative
Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention states:,non-argumentative
The restrictions permitted under this Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.,non-argumentative
"The Commission is therefore competent to examine the grounds given by the Supreme Court on 13 July 1992 for the applicant's arrest and detention, insofar as these grounds remained unchanged and continued to exist after the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, until the applicant's release from detention on 30 December 1992.",non-argumentative
"The applicant submits that, insofar as the authorities refer, in respect of the offence which he had allegedly committed, to Section 203 of the Bulgarian Penal Code, there was no claim, and no evidence, that he misappropriated funds personally, and to his own benefit.",non-argumentative
The applicant further states that Bulgarian law does not list the grounds stated in the order of 9 July 1992 which referred to the nature of the crime and his personality.,non-argumentative
"Bulgarian law also does not list the grounds stated in the decision of the Supreme Court of 13 July 1992, namely that the applicant was detained because he was a member of the National Assembly, and had appealed against the withdrawal of his passport.",non-argumentative
The Government submit that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded.,non-argumentative
"Thus, the applicant's detention on remand was lawful in that it was imposed by the competent organs on grounds provided for by law.",non-argumentative
Reference is made here in particular to Sections 147 and 152 para. 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure invoked by the domestic authorities.,non-argumentative
The Commission finds that these complaints raise serious questions of fact and law which are of such complexity that their determination should depend on an examination of the merits.,non-argumentative
"This aspect of the case cannot, therefore, be regarded as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention, and no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.",non-argumentative
The Government submit that this complaint is manifestly ill- founded as the authorities constantly reviewed the applicant's health and adequately reacted to the applicant's complaints and the various medical reports.,non-argumentative
"Reference is made to the fact that after 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant spent altogether only 11 days in prison, and the remaining time, altogether 137 days, in various hospitals, among them the best in Bulgaria.",non-argumentative
Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention states:,non-argumentative
"""No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""",non-argumentative
"According to the Convention organs' case-law, ill-treatment within the meaning of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention must attain a certain minimum level of severity, if it is to fall within the scope of this provision.",non-argumentative
"The assessment of this minimum is in the nature of things relative and will depend on all the circumstances of the case (see Eur. Court H.R., Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series A no. 25, p. 65, para. 162).",non-argumentative
"With regard to the nature of the present complaints, the Commission further recalls its case-law according to which inhuman treatment may be found to exist when a person's detention as such causes him ill-health.",non-argumentative
Against this background the Commission will examine whether the treatment afforded to the applicant by the authorities was adequate.,non-argumentative
"Insofar as the applicant complains that the prohibition to meet relatives and other persons amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, the Commission finds no separate issue under this provision.",non-argumentative
It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill- founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
Under Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention the applicant complains that criminal proceedings were instituted against him on the basis of acts which did not constitute a criminal offence at the time when they were committed.,non-argumentative
"For these reasons, the Commission, by a majority,",non-argumentative
"DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits, the applicant's complaints under Articles 5 para. 1 and 18 (Art. 5-1, 18) of the Convention regarding his detention on remand;",non-argumentative
DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application.,non-argumentative
In all other cases a detained person could always request the investigating authorities to replace detention on remand by another measure where there had been a change of circumstances.,non-argumentative
It transpires from the subsequent order of Public Prosecutor D. of 2 November 1992 that the Prosecutor General dismissed this request on 22 October 1992.,non-argumentative
By order of 2 November 1992 Public Prosecutor D. dismissed the applicant's request for release as the Prosecutor General had already dealt with it.,non-argumentative
"The Committee examined in particular the conditions of his detention. On 12 September 1992, at the 88th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Council in Stockholm, the Committee issued a Report on the applicant's case in which it expressed doubts whether the applicant's detention was justified under Bulgarian law.",non-argumentative
By letter of 9 November 1992 Public Prosecutor D. replied:,non-argumentative
"Section 152 states, insofar as relevant:",non-argumentative
"The applicant complains under Articles 5 para. 1 (c) and 18 (Art. 5-1-c, 18) of the Convention of his detention on remand.",non-argumentative
He further complains that while remanded in custody he suffered inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
"In such cases, however, the Commission will examine in particular the medical treatment at that person's disposal.",non-argumentative
"There remains furthermore the State's obligation to maintain a continuous review of the detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the health and well-being of all prisoners, having due regard to the ordinary and reasonable requirements of imprisonment (see No. 8224/78, Bonnechaux v. Switzerland, Comm. Report 5.12.79, D.R. 18 p. 126 et seq. at p. 148; No. 8317/78, McFeeley and others v. the United Kingdom, Dec. 15.5.80, D.R. 20 p. 44 et seq. at p. 81).",non-argumentative
Hospitalisation is unnecessary.,non-argumentative
Outpatients' treatment is recommended.,non-argumentative
On 9 November 1992 the applicant's lawyer informed Public Prosecutor D. that the applicant had meanwhile filed an application with the Commission.,non-argumentative
Section VII of the Application Form obliged him to provide copies of domestic decisions.,non-argumentative
In the present case the Commission will first examine the applicant's state of health while in detention.,non-argumentative
The request continued:,non-argumentative
