They submit in particular that the applicant did not bring private prosecution proceedings against the police officers concerned for insult within the meaning of S. 115 of the Penal Code.,premise
They further consider that she failed properly to reason her constitutional complaint as regards the alleged insults so as to enable the Constitutional Court to assume its competence to entertain this complaint.,premise
"The Government maintain that the applicant failed, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, to exhaust the domestic remedies at her disposal under Austrian law.",conclusion
The applicant considers that her ill-treatment amounted to bodily assault which had to be prosecuted ex officio and,premise
therefore could not be the subject of private prosecution proceedings.,conclusion
"The Commission observes that the basis of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention is that, before proceedings are brought in an international court, the state made answerable must have had an opportunity to redress the alleged damage by domestic means within the framework of its own legal system (cf. No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57).",premise
"In respect of alleged ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention, the Commission has held that raising criminal charges against the officials concerned or filing a civil action for compensation are effective remedies to be exhausted pursuant to Article 26 (Art. 26) (No. 11208/84, Dec. 4.3.86, D.R. 46 p. 182; No. 10078/82, Dec. 13.12.84, D.R. 41 p. 103; No. 5964/72, Dec. 29.9.75, D.R. 3 p. 57).",premise
"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's complaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not constitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.",conclusion
"In the present case, the applicant did not bring private prosecution proceedings against the police officers concerned for insult, or, assuming that the alleged acts had to be prosecuted ex officio, lay any criminal charges against the police officers requesting their prosecution.",premise
"In this context, the Commission had regard to the criminal proceedings instituted against three police officers upon accusations of ill-treatment raised by the applicant's husband, which the applicant's husband joined as a private party claiming compensation.",premise
"In the course of these proceedings, the allegations of the applicant's husband were carefully examined at two court levels.",premise
"The applicant did not institute civil proceedings either, with a view to claiming compensation in particular as regards the alleged detrimental consequences of the events in question.",premise
"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's complaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not constitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.",conclusion
The competence of the Constitutional Court to receive complaints about the violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights is limited under S. 144 para. 1 of the Federal Constitution to formal decisions of administrative authorities or the exercise of direct administrative authority and coercion against a particular individual.,premise
"The Constitutional Court, in its decision of 28 November 1989, declared the applicant's complaint about the alleged insults committed by police officers in the course of her detention inadmissible in accordance with its constant case-law, according to which mere insults as such did not amount to an administrative act relating to the exercise of direct administrative authority and coercion, even if such insulting remarks were allegedly made in the course of an official act.",premise
"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's complaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not constitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.",conclusion
"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the applicant's complaint to the Constitutional Court about ill-treatment does not constitute an effective and sufficient remedy for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.",premise
The applicant's submissions do not disclose any special circumstance which might have absolved her according to the generally recognised rules of international law from exhausting the effective domestic remedies at her disposal.,premise
It follows that this part of the application must be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 in conjunction with Article 26 (Art. 27-3+26) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The Commission refers to its above findings that under Austrian law, the applicant could have brought criminal charges against the police officers concerned, or filed a civil action for compensation as regards the alleged detrimental consequences of the events for her health.",premise
It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion

"She was first questioned about the suspicion against her and her husband on 1 June 1988, at 12 h.",non-argumentative
"In the course of the questioning, the police officers addressed the applicant in an overfamiliar way (""duzen""), and also insulted her (""Kärntner Schwein"", ""du grande Dame, du"", ""du Trampel"", ""depate Alte"").",non-argumentative

The Constitutional Court rejected the remainder of the applicant's complaint about having been insulted by police officers in the course of her detention.,non-argumentative
"The Constitutional Court found that the applicant's arrest and detention, which had not been ordered by a court, had been unlawful, as the Federal Police Department had failed to show any immediate danger of collusion which could have justified a police action without a warrant of arrest.",non-argumentative
"Likewise, the three searches of the applicant's home had been carried out without a search warrant, no immediate danger exceptionally justifying such action.",non-argumentative
"As regards the alleged insults committed by police officers in the course of the applicant's detention, the Constitutional Court referred to its constant case-law according to which mere insults as such did not amount to an administrative act relating to the exercise of direct administrative authority and coercion, even if such insulting remarks were allegedly made in the course of an official act.",non-argumentative

"S. 115 of the Austrian Penal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) provides in particular that anyone who in public or in the presence of several persons insults, ridicules, or assaults another person or threatens him with assault, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three months or a fine ..., if he is not liable to stricter punishment under another provision.",non-argumentative
