"the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259).",premise
"This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the present case from those applications which have previously been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was present (see the Dudgeon judgment cited above,",conclusion
,
The Court observes that not every sexual activity carried out behind closed doors necessarily falls within the scope of Article 8 (art. 8).,premise
"In the present case, the applicants were involved in consensual sado-masochistic activities for purposes of sexual gratification.",premise
"There can be no doubt that sexual orientation and activity concern an intimate aspect of private life (see, mutatis mutandis, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, para. 52).",premise
"However, a considerable number of people were involved in the activities in question which included, inter alia, the recruitment of new ""members"", the provision of several specially equipped ""chambers"", and the shooting of many videotapes which were distributed among the ""members"" (see paragraphs 8 and 9 above).",premise
"It may thus be open to question whether the sexual activities of the applicants fell entirely within the notion of ""private life"" in the particular circumstances of the case.",premise
"However, since this point has not been disputed by those appearing before it, the Court sees no reason to examine it of its own motion in the present case.",premise
"Assuming, therefore, that the prosecution and conviction of the applicants amounted to an interference with their private life, the question arises whether such an interference was ""necessary in a democratic society"" within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 8 (art. 8-2).",conclusion
,
"(see, mutatis mutandis, the Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, p. 21, para. 52).",premise
There can be no doubt that sexual orientation and activity concern an intimate aspect of private life,conclusion
,
"This submission was contested by the Government and by a majority of the Commission.",premise
" In support of their submission, the applicants alleged that all those involved in the sado-masochistic encounters were willing adult participants; that participation in the acts complained of was carefully restricted and controlled and was limited to persons with like-minded sado-masochistic proclivities; that the acts were not witnessed by the public at large and that there was no danger or likelihood that they would ever be so witnessed; that no serious or permanent injury had been sustained, no infection had been caused to the wounds, and that no medical treatment had been required.",premise
"Furthermore, no complaint was ever made to the police - who learnt about the applicants’ activities by chance (see paragraph 8 above).",premise
"The applicants maintained that the interference in issue could not be regarded as ""necessary in a democratic society"".",conclusion
,
" In fact, in the present case, some of these acts could well be compared to ""genital torture"" and a Contracting State could not be said to have an obligation to tolerate acts of torture because they are committed in the context of a consenting sexual relationship.",premise
"The State was moreover entitled to prohibit activities because of their potential danger.",premise
"For the Government, the State was entitled to punish acts of violence, such as those for which the applicants were convicted, that could not be considered of a trifling or transient nature, irrespective of the consent of the victim",conclusion
,
"In this respect, acts of torture - such as those in issue in the present case - may be banned also on the ground that they undermine the respect which human beings should confer upon each other.",premise
"In any event, the whole issue of the role of consent in the criminal law is of great complexity and the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options.",premise
The Government further contended that the criminal law should seek to deter certain forms of behaviour on public-health grounds but also for broader moral reasons.,conclusion
,
"Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation to consider all the public-policy options.
41.   The Commission noted that the injuries that were or could be caused by the applicants’ activities were of a significant nature and degree, and that the conduct in question was, on any view, of an extreme character.",premise
"The State authorities therefore acted within their margin of appreciation in order to protect its citizens from real risk of serious physical harm or injury.",conclusion
,
The scope of this margin of appreciation is not identical in each case but will vary according to the context.,premise
"Relevant factors include the nature of the Convention right in issue, its importance for the individual and the nature of the activities concerned ",premise
"(see the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment of 25 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, pp. 1291-92, para. 74).",premise
"The State authorities therefore acted within their margin of appreciation in order to protect its citizens from real risk of serious physical harm or injury.",conclusion
,
"This is so whether the activities in question occur in the course of sexual conduct or otherwise.",premise
" The determination of the level of harm that should be tolerated by the law in situations where the victim consents is in the first instance a matter for the State concerned since what is at stake is related, on the one hand, to public health considerations and to the general deterrent effect of the criminal law, and, on the other, to the personal autonomy of the individual.",premise
"The Court considers that one of the roles which the State is unquestionably entitled to undertake is to seek to regulate, through the operation of the criminal law, activities which involve the infliction of physical harm.",conclusion
,
"(see the Dudgeon judgment cited above, the Norris v. Ireland judgment of 26 October 1988, Series A no. 142, and the Modinos v. Cyprus judgment of 22 April 1993, Series A no. 259).",premise
that the applicants’ sado-masochistic activities involved a significant degree of injury or wounding which could not be characterised as trifling or transient.,premise
"This, in itself, suffices to distinguish the present case from those applications which have previously been examined by the Court concerning consensual homosexual behaviour in private between adults where no such feature was present",conclusion
,
"In deciding whether or not to prosecute, the State authorities were entitled to have regard not only to the actual seriousness of the harm caused - which as noted above was considered to be significant - but also, as stated by Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle (see paragraph 21 above), to the potential for harm inherent in the acts in question.",premise
"In this respect it is recalled that the activities were considered by Lord Templeman to be ""unpredictably dangerous"" (see paragraph 20 above).",premise
"Nor does the Court accept the applicants’ submission that no prosecution should have been brought against them since their injuries were not severe and since no medical treatment had been required.",conclusion
,
The Court finds no evidence in support of the applicants’ allegations in either the conduct of the proceedings against them or the judgment of the House of Lords.,premise
"In this respect it recalls the remark of the trial judge when passing sentence that ""the unlawful conduct now before the court would be dealt with equally in the prosecution of heterosexuals or bisexuals if carried out by them"" (see paragraph 11 above).",premise
"Moreover, it is clear from the judgment of the House of Lords that the opinions of the majority were based on the extreme nature of the practices involved and not the sexual proclivities of the applicants (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).",premise
" Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).",conclusion
,
"In any event, like the Court of Appeal, the Court does not consider that the facts in the Wilson case were at all comparable in seriousness to those in the present case (see paragraph 30 above).",premise
" Accordingly, the Court considers that the reasons given by the national authorities for the measures taken in respect of the applicants were relevant and sufficient for the purposes of Article 8 para. 2 (art. 8-2).",conclusion
,
The Court notes that the charges of assault were numerous and referred to illegal activities which had taken place over more than ten years.,premise
"However, only a few charges were selected for inclusion in the prosecution case.",premise
" In these circumstances, bearing in mind the degree of organisation involved in the offences, the measures taken against the applicants cannot be regarded as disproportionate.",conclusion
,
" The concept of private life cannot be stretched indefinitely.",premise
Not every aspect of private life automatically qualifies for protection under the Convention.,premise
The fact that the behaviour concerned takes place on private premises does not suffice to ensure complete immunity and impunity.,premise
Not everything that happens behind closed doors is necessarily acceptable.,premise
"In my view, that Article (art. 8) was not even applicable in the instant case.",conclusion
,
"It is already the case in criminal law that the ""rape"" of a spouse where there is doubt whether consent was given may lead to prosecution.",premise
Other types of behaviour may give rise to civil proceedings (internal telephone tapping for example).,premise
"Sexual acts and abuse, even when not criminal, give rise to liability.",premise
"In my view, that Article (art. 8) was not even applicable in the instant case.",conclusion
,
"The case could have been looked at differently, both in domestic law and subsequently under the Convention.",premise
"Can one consider that adolescents taking part in sado-masochistic activities have given their free and informed consent where their elders have used various means of enticement, including financial reward?",premise
"In domestic law, sado-masochistic activities could be made the subject of a specific criminal offence without that being contrary to Article 8 (art. 8) of the European Convention on Human Rights.",premise
It seems to me that the wording used by the Court in paragraph 42 is too vague.,premise
"It seemed to me necessary to expand paragraph 43 by noting ""to regulate and punish practices of sexual abuse that are demeaning even if they do not involve the infliction of physical harm"".",premise
"The dangers of unrestrained permissiveness, which can lead to debauchery, paedophilia (see paragraph 11 of the judgment) or the torture of others, were highlighted at the Stockholm World Conference.",premise
"The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment",premise
"The protection of private life means the protection of a person’s intimacy and dignity, not the protection of his baseness or the promotion of criminal immoralism.",conclusion
,
"(see Olivier de Schutter’s commentary on that judgment in Revue trimestrielle des droits de l’homme, Brussels, 1997, pp. 64-93).",premise
"The margin of appreciation has been used by the Court mainly in dealing with issues of morals or problems of civil society, but above all so as to afford better protection to others; consequently, a reference to the Müller and Others v. Switzerland judgment would have been preferable to the reference to the Buckley v. the United Kingdom judgment",conclusion

"Nor does the Court accept the applicants’ submission that no prosecution should have been brought against them since their injuries were not severe and since no medical treatment had been required.",premise
The applicants have further submitted that they were singled out partly because of the authorities’ bias against homosexuals,premise
"In sum, the Court finds that the national authorities were entitled to consider that the prosecution and conviction of the applicants were necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 8-2).",conclusion
,
It is evident from the facts established by the national courts,premise
that the applicants’ sado-masochistic activities involved a significant degree of injury or wounding which could not be characterised as trifling or transient.,conclusion
