"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.",premise
This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.,premise
Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).,premise
"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 14 above).",premise
"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention.",conclusion
"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention.",premise
It follows that Article 6 (art. 6) applies.,conclusion
"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures.",premise
"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.",premise
"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison.",premise
"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.",premise
"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.",premise
"It mattered little in this respect that section 5 of the Road Traffic Act, which was applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because that provision merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in section 7 of the Traffic Police Act 1947 (see paragraph 15 above).",premise
"According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.",conclusion
"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:",premise
"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision.",premise
Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).,premise
"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""",premise
The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.,conclusion
"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.",premise
"The Court points out that in the Chorherr v. Austria judgment of 25 August 1993 it held that Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention was compatible with Article 64 (art. 64) (Series A no. 266-B, p. 35, para. 21).",premise
"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.",premise
They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.,premise
The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.,conclusion
"The Court notes that Mr Pfarrmeier based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.",premise
"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.",premise
"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied.",premise
These considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.,conclusion
"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).",premise
"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:",conclusion
The Constitutional Court is not such a body.,premise
"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts.",premise
It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).,conclusion
The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.,premise
"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"".",premise
"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.",premise
"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention.",conclusion
"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:",premise
It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).,premise
"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention.",premise
"Moreover, in a judgment of 14 October 1987 the Constitutional Court held that in respect of criminal penalties not covered by the reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5), the limited review conducted by the Administrative Court or the Constitutional Court was insufficient (see paragraph 23 above).",premise
"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"".",conclusion
"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"".",premise
There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point.,conclusion
"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.",premise
"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 21 above).",premise
"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.",conclusion
"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.",premise
"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.",premise
"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.",premise
"Mr Pfarrmeier contended that none of the bodies that had dealt with his case in the proceedings in issue could be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",conclusion
"It cannot speculate as to what the outcome of the proceedings in issue might have been if the violation of the Convention had not occurred (see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989,",premise
"Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47).",premise
"It considers that, in the circumstances of the case, the present judgment affords the applicant sufficient reparation.",conclusion
My main objection to this paragraph is the following.,premise
"In the three civil cases discussed in my aforementioned separate opinion, the Court found that the Austrian Administrative Court met the requirements of a tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",premise
"In the paragraph under discussion, however, it reaches the opposite conclusion, stressing that in this case the Administrative Court was sitting in proceedings of a criminal nature.",premise
"One cannot but infer that the Court is of the opinion that in a case which under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""criminal"" one, the safeguards afforded by the tribunal that is to review the final decision of the administrative bodies differ from those required in a case that under national law is an ""administrative"" one but under the Convention is a ""civil"" one.",premise
"Nor does the Court offer one, its decision on this crucial point being unsupported by any argument.",premise
This is the more to be regretted as this differentiation is contrary to the Court's case-law .,premise
I refer in this context to footnote 62 of my aforementioned separate opinion in the case of Fischer v. Austria.,premise
"See, inter alia, the Le Compte, Van Leuven and De Meyere v. Belgium judgment of 23 June 1981, Series A no. 43, pp. 23-24, para. 53; the Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium judgment of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 17, para. 30; see also the Diennet v. France judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 325-A, pp. 13-14, para. 28.",premise
"I cannot see any justification for such differentiation, which does not find support in the wording or the purpose of Article 6 (art. 6) .",premise
"My objections concern paragraph 40 of the judgment, which starts with the statement:",conclusion
