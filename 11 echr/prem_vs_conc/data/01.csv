that it would not be justified to strike it off the list of cases.,premise
"The Commission concludes that the applicant may be said to have complied with the domestic remedies' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention and, consequently, the application cannot be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3).",premise
"The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts. However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings, and it is therefore impossible to reject the application on this ground.",premise
"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application as a whole.",premise
"For these reasons, the Commission unanimously DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.",conclusion
The Commission notes the declaration by the applicant's representatives that the applicant's father wishes to pursue proceedings before the Commission.,premise
"Moreover, it finds that, in view of the serious nature of the complaints and their connection with the general situation in South-East Turkey,",premise
the application is of such general interest,premise
that it would not be justified to strike it off the list of cases.,conclusion
it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.,premise
"The Commission concludes that the applicant may be said to have complied with the domestic remedies' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention and, consequently, the application cannot be rejected under Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 27-3).",conclusion
"Moreover, when asked to sign a statement, he had answered that he could not sign because he could not move his hands.",premise
The Commission notes the applicant's declaration that he had told the public prosecutor that he had been tortured.,premise
it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.,conclusion
"It is not possible to establish in detail what happened during the applicant's meeting with the public prosecutor, but the Commission finds no reason to doubt that during their conversation there were elements which should have made the public prosecutor initiate an investigation or, at the very least, try to obtain further information from the applicant about his state of health or about the treatment to which he had been subjected.",premise
it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.,conclusion
"Moreover, his family had also been affected by the actions of the authorities insofar as his father and one of his brothers had been detained for short periods at about the same time, and the applicant himself was hospitalised for two weeks after his release.",premise
"The threats to which the applicant claimed to have been exposed after he had complained to the Commission, as well as his tragic death in circumstances which have so far not been fully clarified, are further elements which may at least support the view that the pursuance of remedies may not be devoid of serious risks.",premise
it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.,conclusion
"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicant, because",premise
it anyway finds that the applicant has done all that could be expected in the circumstances.,conclusion
"The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective.",premise
"He did not deny that the procedures identified by the Government are formally part of the Turkish legal structure, but he contended that the Government have not shown how such procedures could conceivably be effective for the specific circumstances of the present case.",premise
The applicant maintained that there was no requirement that he pursue domestic remedies further than he did by telling the public prosecutor that he had been tortured by his custodians.,conclusion
The applicant considered that none of the remedies suggested by the Government could be regarded as effective because the scale of torture committed with impunity by agents of the State in detention centres is such that this must be considered high-level Government policy - an administrative practice - in regard to which all remedies are theoretical and irrelevant.,premise
"The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective.",conclusion
"This has been confirmed by such bodies as the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which, in its public statement of 15 December 1992, concluded that the practice of torture and other forms of severe ill-treatment of persons in police custody remains widespread in Turkey, and that such methods are applied to both ordinary criminal suspects and persons held under anti-terrorist provisions (p. 6 para. 21).",premise
"The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective.",conclusion
The purported remedies were thus ineffective for the following reasons:,premise
the limitations on rights and remedies created by the state of emergency;,premise
an administrative practice of torture in Turkish detention centres;,premise
"the lack of genuine investigations by public prosecutors and other competent authorities, who ignore the evidence of their own eyes, as in this case, and either do nothing or simply take evidence from the members of the police or security forces;",premise
"even if an investigation is made, the lack of effective action being taken afterwards;",premise
an official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces;,premise
"the positive discouragement of those who do wish to seek remedies, as has been demonstrated so tragically in the present case;",premise
"an administrative practice of not respecting the rule under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention which requires the provision of effective domestic remedies; and - whether or not there is an administrative practice, domestic remedies were ineffective in this case, owing to the failure of the legal system to provide redress.",premise
"The applicant submitted that any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective.",conclusion
"At present 16 lawyers are facing criminal charges, which include drawing up documents belittling the Turkish State and faxing them to human rights organisations in Europe.",premise
This is demonstrated in other cases pending before the Commission.,premise
"The applicant added that, in order to be able to use a remedy,",conclusion
Another key group in guaranteeing effective investigation and protection is the medical profession.,premise
Doctors must be free to give honest accounts of what they have found in their investigations.,premise
"However, the applicant alleged that doctors have been intimidated, as was the case of the doctor whom he consulted at the Dicle Medical Faculty.",premise
"The applicant added that, in order to be able to use a remedy,",conclusion
the Government have referred to a number of judgments by the administrative and criminal courts.,premise
"Some of these decisions concern cases in which the State Council has ordered the prosecution of public officials for ill-treating people in custody, despite the initial view of the local administrative council that the cases were unsuitable for criminal proceedings.",premise
"In order to demonstrate that the available remedies were not ineffective,",conclusion
"the second requirement of Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, namely that of lodging the application within six months of the final effective decision or, if none, within six months of the events of which complaints are made.",premise
"The present application was lodged on 3 May 1993, i.e. within the six month period.",premise
He did indeed comply with the six months' rule laid down in Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The Government submit that it is generally accepted in the comparative and international law on terrorism, authorising ""certain adaptations of the liberal model"", that restrictions on Convention rights will be deemed necessary in a democratic society threatened by terrorist violence, as being proportionate to the aim of protecting public order.",premise
"The threat posed to Turkey by the PKK and its affiliations is internationally recognised, as is the need to react firmly to it.",premise
In this respect the Government assert that the powers exercised by the police while the applicant was in their custody did not exceed the margin of appreciation conferred on States by the Convention.,premise
They add that his death was not the work of any State agent but that of terrorist in-fighting.,premise
"Accordingly, the Government consider that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"As to Articles 6 and 13 (Art. 6, 13) of the Convention, the Government submit that Turkish law guarantees several remedies (as described above at pp. 5-6) without discrimination.",premise
"Accordingly, the Government consider that the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
The application principally concerns torture and inhuman conditions of detention.,premise
"It involves rights under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention which is absolute, unqualified and non-derogable.",premise
"There is, therefore, no scope to take into account the political situation in the region concerned.",conclusion
"As regards the complaint under Article 5 para. 3 (Art. 5-3) of the Convention and the derogation under Article 15 (Art. 15), the applicant contested the necessity of a measure permitting detention for as long as 30 days without any of the basic safeguards against abuse, which were deemed to be essential by the Convention organs",premise
"(Eur. Court H.R., Brannigan and McBride judgment of 26 May 1993, Series A no. 258- B, pp. 55-56, paras. 62-66).",premise
The applicant submitted that the length of his detention was excessive even by derogation standards.,conclusion
The Commission considers that the Government's argument could only be accepted if it were clear that the application was based on untrue facts.,premise
"However, this is far from clear at the present stage of the proceedings,",premise
it is therefore impossible to reject the application on this ground.,conclusion
