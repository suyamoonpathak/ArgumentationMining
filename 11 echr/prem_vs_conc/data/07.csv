"Furthermore, it notes that the applicant was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment, commutable to a fine of GRD 1,000 per day of detention, which sum he paid.",premise
"Like the Delegate of the Commission, the Court considers that the applicant's heirs also have a definite pecuniary interest under Article 50 of the Convention (art. 50).",conclusion
"Relying on the Commission's case-law on the question, they submitted that the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10) was so closely and directly bound up with the deceased applicant's person that his heirs could not assert any specific legal interest which would enable them to continue the proceedings in his stead.",premise
The Government contested the right of the applicant's widow and children to continue before the Court the proceedings he had instituted.,conclusion
"Moreover, the applicant's case was an isolated one which raised no question of general interest.",premise

since they concerned the name and cultural identity of an entire minority.,premise
"In addition, he maintained that the interest of the present proceedings went well beyond the individual case of Mr Ahmet Sadik",conclusion

It reiterates that the supervision machinery set up by the Convention is subsidiary to the national human rights protection systems.,premise
"Even if the Greek courts were able, or even obliged, to examine the case of their own motion under the Convention, this cannot have dispensed the applicant from relying on the Convention in those courts or from advancing arguments to the same or like effect before them, thus drawing their attention to the problem he intended to submit subsequently, if need be, to the institutions responsible for European supervision",premise
"Accordingly, domestic remedies were not exhausted in the instant case.",conclusion
"That principle is reflected in the rule set forth in Article 26 (art. 26), which ""dispenses States from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an opportunity to put matters right through their own legal system""",premise
"(see the De Wilde, Ooms and Versyp v. Belgium judgment of 18 June 1971, Series A no. 12, p. 29, para. 50).",premise
"Accordingly, it recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given.",premise
"It normally requires also that the complaints intended to be made subsequently at Strasbourg should have been made to those same courts, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law",premise

"In its judgment of 16 September 1996 in the case of Akdivar and Others v. Turkey (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV),",premise
the Court emphasised that the application of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting Parties have agreed to set up.,premise
"Accordingly, it recognised that Article 26 (art. 26) must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism and that it does not require merely that applications should be made to the appropriate domestic courts and that use should be made of remedies designed to challenge decisions already given.",conclusion

"The Court notes that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law (Article 28 para. 1 of the Constitution - see paragraph 19 above).",premise
It further notes that Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10) is directly applicable;,premise

Mr Ahmet Sadik could therefore have relied on that provision (art. 10) in the Greek courts and complained of a violation thereof in his case.,premise
"At no time, however, did the applicant rely on Article 10 of the Convention (art. 10), or on arguments to the same or like effect based on domestic law, in the courts dealing with his case.",premise
"In both the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal the applicant, who, in his appeal on points of law, put forward arguments which were based solely on domestic law and did not raise the matter of freedom of expression (see paragraph 17 above), merely defended himself against the charge of disturbing the peace, contrary to Article 192 of the Criminal Code.",premise
In that respect there is a clear distinction between the present case and the cases of Castells v. Spain and Guzzardi v. Italy.,conclusion
"(see the Van Oosterwijck v. Belgium judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 40, p. 19, para. 39).",premise
"Even if the Greek courts were able, or even obliged, to examine the case of their own motion under the Convention, this cannot have dispensed the applicant from relying on the Convention in those courts or from advancing arguments to the same or like effect before them, thus drawing their attention to the problem he intended to submit subsequently, if need be, to the institutions responsible for European supervision",conclusion
They asserted that neither the applicant nor his lawyers had alleged at any stage of the proceedings in the Rodopi Criminal Court and the Patras Court of Appeal - even indirectly or in abstract terms - any infringement whatsoever of the right to freedom of expression.,premise
"The only reason why, in the Court of Cassation, the applicant had asserted his right to use the term ""Turkish"" to designate the Muslims of Western Thrace had been to prove that the act he had committed was not sufficient to make out the objective element of the offence defined in Article 192 of the Criminal Code.",premise
"The Government submitted that Mr Ahmet Sadik had not exhausted domestic remedies, not having raised before the national courts, even in substance, the complaint relating to a violation of Article 10 (art. 10).",conclusion

"While it fell to that court to review the constitutionality of a legislative provision proprio motu, it could not - in the absence of an express application to this effect by the parties - consider whether the provision concerned had been applied to the facts of the case before it in a manner compatible with the Constitution.",premise
"In addition, the Court of Cassation could not consider of its own motion the possibility of an infringement of the right to freedom of expression.",conclusion
"However, no judicial authority in Greece was disposed to affirm that a member of the ""Turkish minority"" enjoyed such a right.",premise
"Be that as it may, the judge in a criminal case had a duty to take into consideration of his own motion, especially when contemplating imposing a heavy sentence on the defendant, the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and the Convention, which in Greece took precedence over legislation.",premise
"Even supposing that he had not invoked his right to freedom of expression in substance in the Greek courts, judges were under a duty to determine of their own motion where the dividing line between the right to declare one's ethnic origin and the offence of inciting disorder should be drawn.",conclusion
"Obviously, it has often been pointed out that the Court's case-law has evolved considerably since the Convention came into force.",premise
"But there is one important distinction to be made. While this evolution is normal - subject to the necessary precautions being taken - with regard to the Convention's substantive provisions, it can only be exceptional and limited with regard to the procedural provisions such as the fundamental rule of international law that domestic remedies must be exhausted.",premise
"I consider it needful to sound a warning concerning the scope of the exhaustion-of-domestic-remedies principle, which, under the terms of Article 26 of the Convention (art. 26), must be construed ""according to the generally recognised rules of international law"". That means that the condition concerned cannot be minimised as is sometimes envisaged.",conclusion
"One of the essential arguments against the Court's doctrine that it has jurisdiction to examine afresh preliminary objections already rejected by the Commission is that this doctrine has rather unpalatable effects: it makes it possible, after long years of Strasbourg proceedings, for very important issues to remain undecided .",premise
"My primary argument for so voting was that I maintain, as a matter of principle, that the Court should leave it to the Commission to determine whether such pleas are founded or not.",conclusion
"See paragraph 4.2 of my dissenting opinion in the case of Brozicek v. Italy of 19 December 1989 (Series A no. 167, pp. 23 et seq.). My opposition to this doctrine - which has gradually won some support within the Court - was spurned in the Court's judgment of 25 March 1992 in the case of B. v. France (Series A no. 232-C).",premise
"My primary argument for so voting was that I maintain, as a matter of principle, that the Court should leave it to the Commission to determine whether such pleas are founded or not.",conclusion
"Applying the above general considerations to the case of Ahmet Sadik I note in the first place that the Convention forms an integral part of the Greek legal system, where it takes precedence over every contrary provision of the law and that, moreover, Article 10 (art. 10) is directly applicable under Greek law.",premise
"Consequently, my starting-point is that the Greek Supreme Court, when dealing with the applicant's appeal against his conviction by the Patras Court of Appeal, in principle could and should have applied Article 10 (art. 10) - as interpreted in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights - ex officio (see paragraph 11 above).",conclusion
"In this context I recall that the grievances raised by the applicant were very broad: he maintained, inter alia, that the prosecution case should have been dismissed and that the Patras Court of Appeal had not given sufficient reasons for its decision",premise
"Thus supplementing the arguments would have meant, in the light of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, that the Greek Supreme Court should also have assessed ex officio whether the applicant's conviction and sentence were proportionate.",premise
"I note in the second place that, even supposing that the Greek Supreme Court in criminal cases lacks the power to quash of its own motion, this does not necessarily imply that it cannot ex officio supplement legal arguments for grievances put forward by the appellant.",conclusion
"It should have scrutinised the lower courts' judgments in the light of Article 10 (art. 10), that is: should have critically examined whether their findings of fact and their reasoning were sufficiently solid to justify convincingly the interference with the applicant's freedom of expression.",premise
"I note in the second place that, even supposing that the Greek Supreme Court in criminal cases lacks the power to quash of its own motion, this does not necessarily imply that it cannot ex officio supplement legal arguments for grievances put forward by the appellant.",conclusion

"Thus, the Government have failed to prove that the Greek Supreme Court could not do what it should have done (see paragraph 14 above in fine).",conclusion
"There is little or no evidence for the Government's thesis on the long-range policy of secession which they see behind the impugned use of the designation ""Turkish"".",premise
Nor is there a scrap of evidence for the assertion that there is a direct or even an indirect causal link between the impugned terminology in the pamphlet of October 1989 and the violence and disorder of 29 January 1990.,premise
"In sum, I have not been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were a justifiable response to truly reprehensible use of seditious language.",conclusion
In its report referred to in paragraph 4 of the Court's judgment Helsinki Watch suggests that the incidents were rather the work of the majority!,premise
"In sum, I have not been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were a justifiable response to truly reprehensible use of seditious language.",conclusion
"In sum, I have not been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were a justifiable response to truly reprehensible use of seditious language.",premise
It follows that neither have I been convinced that the applicant's conviction and sentence were necessary in a democratic society.,conclusion

For these reasons I find that there has been a violation.,conclusion
"(see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72)",premise
that the Court cannot deal with the merits of the applicant's complaints on account of his failure to exhaust domestic remedies.,conclusion
"Article 27 of the Convention (art. 27) requires a flexible interpretation without excessive regard for matters of form (see the Guzzardi v. Italy judgment of 6 November 1980, Series A no. 39, p. 26, para. 72), a ""pro victima"" approach in favour of admissibility in order to allow the Convention institutions to consider the alleged complaints.",premise
