"They add, in this respect, that although the offence under Section 5 of the Road Traffic Act was not, as such, in force at the date of the reservation, the law then in force did impose an obligation on road users to drive with reasonable consideration for other road users.",premise
"To the extent that the absence of an oral hearing is raised, the respondent Government also rely on the Austrian reservation to Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention.",premise
They also point out that the applicant did not make a complaint about the absence of a hearing before the Administrative Court.,premise
"They accept, however, that if the reservation does not prevent an examination, then the review of administrative decisions by the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court was not sufficiently wide to comply with Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.",conclusion
because it cannot cover offences which were not in force at the date of the reservation.,premise
The applicant considers that the Austrian reservation to Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention is in any event not applicable in the present case,conclusion
"In connection with Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution, the Government consider that, although the provision provides for non-acceptance of a constitutional complaint on grounds which were not in force in 1958 when the reservation was made",premise
The Government point out that any appeal lodged with the Constitutional Court against a decision is subject to comprehensive review.,premise
"the ability of the Constitutional Court to refuse to deal with appeals against decisions without giving detailed reasons is only a procedural, not a substantive limitation.",conclusion
"The applicant in this respect considers that the Constitutional Court's jurisdiction has been limited subsequ entry into force of Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution,",premise
"that therefore, even if the reservation applies, it has not been complied with in this respect.",conclusion
as it is not intended to have legally binding effects on the interpretation.,premise
"With regard to the declaration made by Austria when ratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the declaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention",conclusion
"They point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed on 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case on 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988, whereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988.",premise
"With regard to the declaration made by Austria when ratifying Protocol No. 7, the Government submit first that the declaration is not required to comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention",premise
"Finally, they consider that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) has in any event been complied with as it applies only where the facts and legal provisions are to be regarded as a unit.",premise
"Thus, they conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may nevertheless be convicted under these.",conclusion
"Thus, they conclude that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4) proscribes proceedings being brought against a person twice under the same provision, but that if by a single act an offender contravenes several provisions, he may nevertheless be convicted under these.",premise
The Government underline that the offence of causing death under the influence of drink contained in Article 81 para. 2 of the Criminal Code is different in character from the provision of Section 5 para. 1 of the Road Traffic Act,premise
which makes it an offence to drive a motor vehicle whilst unfit to drive through drink.,conclusion
"The applicant underlines that for the individual concerned the principle ""ne bis in idem"" must apply to every punishable act, and not merely to the provision of law.",premise
He points out that both criminal and administrative authorities apply a level of 0.8 per mille as constituting a state of inebriation.,premise
"as it is not clear whether it covers double or multiple convictions only by the Austrian criminal courts, or double or multiple convictions by Austrian criminal courts on the one hand and Austrian administrative criminal authorities on the other.",premise
"He also considers that the declaration made to Articles 3 and 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-3, P7-4) does not comply with Article 64 (Art. 64) of the Convention",conclusion
The Commission finds that the complaint relating to the presumption of innocence was not made in the applicant's application form or in correspondence with the Commission's Secretariat.,premise
"The mere fact that, by virtue of general words a complaint is not excluded from an application, is not sufficient to regard that complaint as having been made.",premise
This part of the application must accordingly be rejected under Article 26 in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 26+27-3) of the Convention as having been introduced out of time.,conclusion
"They point out that the facts relating to the offence were committed on 1 January 1987, that the first instance authority decided the case on 16 July 1987 and the second instance authority on 27 July 1988, whereas Protocol No. 7 entered into force on 1 November 1988.",premise
"The Government submit that because the Administrative Court is required to review a decision under administrative criminal law on the basis of the substantive law at the date of commission of the offence (or at the date of the first instance decision if more advantageous to a defendant), the fact that the Administrative Court took its decision five months after the Protocol had entered into force does not affect the position",premise
"the respondent Government submit first, that the Commission is prevented ratione temporis from considering this complaint under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 (P7-4).",conclusion
"The Commission finds that these complaints raise complex issues of law under the Convention, including questions concerning the Austrian reservations to Articles 5 and 6 (Art. 5, 6) of the Convention, the Austrian declaration to Protocol No. 7 (P7) to the Convention and questions concerning the competence of the Commission ratione temporis to deal with the complaints under Protocol No. 7 (P7), the determination of which must be reserved to an examination of the merits.",premise
This part of the application cannot therefore be declared manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
This part of the application must accordingly be rejected under Article 26 in conjunction with Article 27 para. 3 (Art. 26+27-3) of the Convention as having been introduced out of time.,premise
"For these reasons, the Commission unanimously DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the applicant's complaint relating to the presumption of innocence and by a majority DECLARES ADMISSIBLE the remainder of the application, without prejudging the merits of the case.",conclusion
