The essence of the case concerns the criticisms made in the Inspectors' report about the first three applicants and the effects of the report upon their honour and reputation.,premise
Even though they own the fourth applicant company no evidence of any criticism of the company or any prejudice to its reputation has been put forward.,premise
In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.,conclusion
In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the fourth applicant company cannot claim to be a victim of a violation of the Convention.,premise
"It follows that, in respect of the fourth applicant company, the application is incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention and this aspect of the case must, therefore, be rejected under Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
The extensive publicity after the report's publication was ephemeral.,premise
"Whilst it is true that an action in defamation against these public officials would probably have been successfully defended on the ground of privilege, this merely reflects the limited content of the right to reputation under domestic law, rather than the right of access to court for determining the applicants' civil rights under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention.",premise
"The Government have contended that the applicants could have brought defamation proceedings against others, particularly proceedings against Lonrho and The Observer, and those who worked for them, in respect of the allegedly serious improprieties committed by them during Lonrho's acrimonious campaign and, more particularly, in respect of the very matters central to the Inspectors' report.",premise
The Government have disputed a claim made by the applicants that any jury trial of these issues would have been biased and that they therefore had to withdrew the defamation proceedings against The Observer.,premise
They have contended that the report could not be used as evidence in those proceedings.,premise
"The Government emphasised that the decision of the Secretary of State to publish the report was not a decision directed against the applicants; it was a decision taken in the general public interest, including that of freedom of expression and information, having regard to the overall content of the report.",premise
"The Government have submitted, inter alia, that the applicants' complaints about the consequences for them of the publication of the report were exaggerated and unsubstantiated.",conclusion
The Commission considers that this part of the application raises a serious question of fact and law which is of such complexity that its determination should depend on an examination of the merits.,premise
"This aspect of the application cannot, therefore, be regarded as being manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention, and no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.",conclusion
"Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) of the Convention, cited above, guarantees a fair hearing in the determination of criminal charges.",premise
"Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) provides that anyone ""charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law"".",premise
The applicants have next complained that the publication of the Inspectors' report violated the presumption of innocence.,conclusion
The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation.,premise
"The Government have submitted, inter alia, that the applicants were not persons who had been charged with a criminal offence within the meaning of Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"They had been appointed to investigate and report on the fourth applicant's affairs, and, in particular the acquisition of shares in House of Fraser plc (HOF) in 1984 and 1985.",premise
Before the Inspectors' report was published it was clearly and publicly stated by the competent authorities that no criminal proceedings would be brought against the applicants.,premise
The Inspectors had not made any findings of criminal conduct by the applicants.,premise
"They considered that the applicants had been dishonest over certain matters, but although dishonesty is reprehensible, it is not a criminal offence.",premise
The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation.,conclusion
"The Commission considers that while the Inspectors' report was being studied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the applicants could have considered themselves affected by a possible criminal prosecution",premise
"(cf. the Court's aforementioned Deweer judgment of 27 February 1990, p. 24, para. 46, and the Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982, p. 15, para. 30).",premise
"therefore, ""charged"", within the meaning of Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention",conclusion
"However, once these officials had issued their public statements on 1 March 1990 that the applicants would not be prosecuted, there can, in the Commission's view, be no question of the applicants being deemed to have been ""charged"" any longer.",premise
The Inspectors' report was published a week after the DPP and SFO statements.,premise
"The report made no findings that the applicants had committed any criminal offence, although it was critical of certain aspects of their business affairs.",premise
The Inspectors had not conducted a criminal investigation.,premise
"In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the applicants' rights under Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed.",conclusion
"In these circumstances the Commission concludes that the applicants' rights under Article 6 paras. 1 and 2 (Art. 6-1, 6-2) of the Convention in respect of the earlier risk of criminal prosecution were not infringed.",premise
"It follows that this aspect of the case is manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life ... 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""",premise
"The applicants have submitted, inter alia, that English law provides no enforceable right to privacy and no safeguards or limitations on the scope of investigations and reports of the kind seen in this case. The report referred to unwarranted aspects of the applicants' private lives and labelled them as dishonest, which had adverse effects on their reputation.",premise
"Even if some of the investigations into the applicants' personal background was legitimate, it was unacceptable and wholly disproportionate to inquire into details of the Fayeds' family and business history, followed by the wholesale publication of private information.",premise
"Any public interest in the conclusions of the Inspectors or the general lessons to be learnt for future commercial practice could have been satisfied by partial publication of the report, but English law did not allow this.",premise
The report could only be published in its entirety or not at all.,premise
"Nor was there any need to protect others' right such as those of Lonrho, by publishing the report in its entirety, as their rights were adequately secured by the ordinary courts.",premise
"The applicants have also complained that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report constituted an unjustified interference with their private lives, contrary to Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides as follows:",conclusion
"The Government have contended, inter alia, that the report did not interfere with the private lives of the applicants.",premise
They stated that the applicants had themselves put their reputation into the public domain before the Inspectors were appointed by the hiring of public relations professionals for this purpose and ensuring media coverage.,premise
The inquiries made by the Inspectors were necessary to establish whether the applicants were who they claimed to be - longstanding successful and wealthy businessmen.,premise
"The Inspectors were aware of the need for privacy and proceeded in whatever manner was least obtrusive to the applicants' privacy (cf. the Inspectors' report paras. 16.2.5 and 16.6.2, pp. 5-6 above).",premise
"Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest (pp. 9 and 13 above)",premise
"In all the circumstances, the Government are of the opinion that the report itself and its publication did not amount to a disproportionate interference with the applicants' right to respect for privacy, and that the publication was well within the Government's margin of appreciation.",conclusion
"States enjoy a margin of appreciation in their decision whether to publish reports of the present kind, provided that the decision is not taken arbitrarily or with malice towards the particular individuals involved.",premise
The question is one of proportionality or balance between the public and the individual interests.,premise
The Commission finds that no elements of arbitrariness are disclosed in the present case.,premise
"Although it might be fair to say that no investigation into the applicants' affairs would have been started if Lonrho had not launched its campaign against them, the actual investigation by the Inspectors and their report indicate no malice or unreasonableness.",premise
As a whole the report may be said to be balanced and thorough; it is not a one-sided condemnation of the applicants and gives them credit where credit is due for their business activities.,premise
"The investigation of certain aspects of their private lives was necessary in view of their claims about their personal backgrounds, which they themselves had vaunted through the media, and as a result of which they had enjoyed a good business reputation for quite some time; hence their success in the HOF takeover bid.",premise
"In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to the legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Commission finds that the making and publication of the Inspectors' report was proportionate to the legitimate aims enunciated above and could be regarded as necessary within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.",premise
"It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.",premise
"The Commission concludes that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
The applicants have alleged that the publication of the report constituted a measure of control of the use of their property.,premise
"It seriously damaged their reputation and financial standing and, thereby, harmed their economic interests in the business of HOF.",premise
Restrictions were put on their management of Harrods Bank.,premise
"Although the publication of the report pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public about the acquisition of HOF, it imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicants, which outweighed the general interest.",conclusion
The restrictions placed on Harrods Bank were made by the Bank of England and were not caused by the publication of the report.,premise
"If banking restrictions were in any way to fall within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1), the Government have submitted that the measure fully complied with the requirements of that provision, given the Government's margin of appreciation in ensuring the general public interest and the proportionate nature of the restrictions.",premise
The Government have contended that the applicants' claim was wholly unspecific as to the nature of the harm done to any of their economic interests.,conclusion
No evidence of any significant economic prejudice has been submitted to it.,premise
"Insofar as certain management restrictions were placed on Harrods Bank by the Bank of England one month after publication of the report, the Commission notes that the applicants had a right of appeal to an independent tribunal which does not appear to have been tried (pp. 14-15 above).",premise
In the circumstances the Commission finds that no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) has been disclosed in the present case.,conclusion
In the circumstances the Commission finds that no appearance of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) has been disclosed in the present case.,premise
"It follows that this aspect of the application is also manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"Article 13 (Art. 13) provides as follows: ""Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.""",premise
Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims.,premise
"To this extent it follows that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is partially manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"However, as regards the second aspect, the Commission recalls that Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention does not require a remedy under domestic law in respect of every alleged violation of the Convention.",premise
"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention",premise
"The Commission has found above that the applicants' claims under Article 6 paras. 1 (criminal) and 2, Article 8 (Art. 6-1, 6-2, 8) of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the Convention are manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",premise
"In the light of the reasons upon which those findings are based, the Commission also considers that the facts of the present case fail to disclose an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of these provisions.",premise
Consequently the applicants cannot derive from Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention a right to a remedy for these Convention claims.,conclusion
"To this extent it follows that the applicants' complaint under Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention is partially manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",premise
"For these reasons, the Commission by a majority DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE in respect of the complaint of the first three applicants under Article 6 para. 1 (Art. 6-1) (civil) of the Convention, both on its own and in relation to Article 13 (Art. 13) of the Convention, without prejudging the merits;",conclusion
"It only applies if the applicant can be said to have an ""arguable claim"" of a violation of the Convention",premise
"(Eur. Court H.R., Boyle and Rice judgment of 27 April 1988, Series A No. 131, p. 23, para. 52).",conclusion
because of the great breadth of the Secretary of State's and the Inspectors' discretionary powers,premise
the restrictive scope of judicial review,premise
impossibility of suing the Inspectors or the Secretary of State in the civil courts for defamation because they would have had a defence of absolute or qualified privilege.,premise
"They have claimed, inter alia, that they had no effective safeguards or domestic remedies against this",conclusion
The applicants have contended that the Inspectors' report made statements about them which amounted to findings of criminal conduct.,premise
"However, Article 6 para. 2 (Art. 6-2) of the Convention requires public officials to refrain from declaring or pronouncing that an individual is guilty of a criminal offence, where guilt has not been proved by a fair judicial process satisfying the requirements of Article 6 (Art. 6)",premise
"(cf. eg. Eur. Court H.R., Adolf judgment of 26 March 1982, Series A No. 49; Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A No. 35; and No. 7986/77, Krause v. Switzerland, Dec. 3.10.78, D.R. 13 p. 73).",premise
The applicants have next complained that the publication of the Inspectors' report violated the presumption of innocence.,conclusion
"Publication was delayed until questions of criminal prosecution had been decided, and sufficient notice was given to the applicants at all stages of the contents of the report to enable them to seek judicial review to prevent publication if they saw fit.",premise
Publication was also necessary to protect the economic well-being of the country as the report revealed weakness in the system of takeover bids.,premise
Publication thereby protected those operating that system in the future.,premise
"It was also necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of others, such as those of Lonrho, its shareholders and associates, by confirming that their allegations about the applicants had been well-founded.",premise
Moreover the report was well-balanced and did not go further than was necessary for the Inspectors' legitimate purpose.,premise
It was not wholly negative about the applicants but gave them credit for their management of HOF (p. 7 above).,premise
"Even if there had been an interference with the applicants' private lives, it was in accordance with the law and necessary for overwhelming reasons of public interest (pp. 9 and 13 above)",conclusion
The Commission finds that the publication of the Inspectors' report with certain of its findings constituted an interference with the applicants' right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1) of the Convention.,premise
"However, that interference was in accordance with the law, the publication being authorised by section 437 (3) (c) of the Companies Act 1985.",premise
Investigations into large scale commercial activities of the present kind and the need to ensure honest dealings fall within the notion of protecting the economic well-being of the country.,premise
The interest of the general public in being informed about matters of major public concern can best be served by the publication of the results of Government inquiries.,premise
Further elements of general interest are cited above at pp. 9 and 13.,premise
The needs of democracy justify transparency in such matters.,premise
"It pursued the legitimate aims, relied on by the Government, of protecting the economic well-being of the country and the rights and freedoms of others, within the meaning of Article 8 para. 2 (Art. 8-2) of the Convention.",conclusion
"""Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.""",premise
"Although the publication of the report pursued the legitimate aim of informing the public about the acquisition of HOF, it imposed an individual and excessive burden on the applicants, which outweighed the general interest.",premise
"The applicants have further complained that there has been an arbitrary and unnecessary interference with the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions, contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (P1-1) to the onvention, which reads as follows:",conclusion
