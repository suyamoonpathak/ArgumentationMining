"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints.",premise
"In the present case, the Government have not provided any additional information which might lead the Commission to depart from the above conclusions in respect of remedies available for the destruction of homes and property in villages and towns.",premise
"The Commission concludes that this application cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and 27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention.",conclusion
The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.,premise
"An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach.",premise
"The Commission does not deem it necessary to determine whether there exists an administrative practice on the part of Turkish authorities tolerating abuses of human rights of the kind alleged by the applicants, because it agrees with the applicants that it has not been established that they had at their disposal adequate remedies under the state of emergency to deal effectively with their complaints.",conclusion

It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the State invoking the rule,premise

"In respect of damage alleged to have been caused by the State or its agents, the Government submit that the applicants had the possibility of introducing an action for compensation before the civil or administrative courts relying, inter alia, on Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution or Article 8 of Decree 430 of 16 December 1990.",premise
"The Government also submit that alleged arson, destruction of property and threatening conduct are prohibited by the Criminal Code, in respect of which complaints could be lodged with the competent authorities, civil or military.",premise
since the applicants have failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,premise
The Government argue that the application is inadmissible,conclusion
"Any purported remedy is illusory, inadequate and ineffective since, inter alia, the operation in question in this case was officially organised, planned and executed by agents of the State and having regard, inter alia, to the situation in South-East Turkey which is such that potential applicants have a well-founded fear of the consequences if they should pursue remedies.",premise
"In this context the applicants also allege a lack of genuine investigations by public prosecutors and other competent authorities; the absence of any cases showing the payment of adequate compensation to villagers for the destruction of their homes and villages, or for their expulsion; an official attitude of legal unaccountability towards the security forces and the lack of any prosecutions against members of the security forces for the alleged offences connected with the destruction of villages and forcible expulsions.",premise
"There is, in the applicants' view, an administrative practice of ineffective remedies.",conclusion
"The Commission concludes that this application cannot be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies under Articles 26 and 27 para. 3 (Art. 26, 27-3) of the Convention.",premise
"The Commission considers, in the light of the parties' submissions, that the case raises complex issues of law and fact under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits of the application as a whole. The Commission concludes, therefore, that the application is not manifestly ill- founded, within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",premise
"For these reasons, the Commission, unanimously, DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.",conclusion
