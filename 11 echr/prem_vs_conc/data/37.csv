"The Commission observes that the Inter-Parliamentary Union is an association of parliamentarians from all over the world, set up inter alia to unite parliamentarians in common action and to advance international peace and cooperation.",premise
The Union is a non-governmental organisation.,premise
The organs of the Union may adopt resolutions which are communicated by the parliamentarians concerned to the national parliaments and to international organisations.,premise
The Commission has examined the meaning and scope of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.,premise
"It considers that the term ""another procedure"" refers to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings similar to those set up by the Convention.",premise
"Moreover, the term ""international investigation or settlement"" refers to institutions and procedures set up by States, thus excluding non-governmental bodies.",premise
"The Commission considers that the Inter-Parliamentary Union constitutes a non-governmental organisation, whereas Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) refers to inter-governmental institutions and procedures.",premise
"It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union do not constitute ""another procedure of international investigation or settlement"" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.",conclusion
Reference is made for instance to the seizure of the applicant's passport; the decision of the Public Prosecutor of 12 August 1992 prohibiting the applicant from speaking alone with his lawyers; the Public Prosecutor's order of 1 September 1992 prohibiting the applicant from seeing other persons; and the period of the applicant's detention up to 7 September 1992.,premise
The Government submit that a number of complaints raised by the applicant are outside the Commission's competence ratione temporis.,conclusion
"The Commission recalls, on the one hand, that with effect from 7 September 1992 Bulgaria ratified the Convention and recognised the Commission's competence under Article 25 (Art. 25) of the Convention to receive individual petitions.",premise
It follows that any complaints about facts occurring prior to 7 September 1992 are incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
"On the other hand, insofar as the facts complained of relate to the period after 7 September 1992, the application cannot be declared inadmissible as being incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention.",premise
"However, the applicant's various complaints raise different issues in respect of the Commission's competence ratione temporis.",premise
"The Commission will therefore duly examine its competence when dealing with the individual complaints. c) In respect of the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention, the applicant points out that the Supreme Court on 13 July 1992 dealt in the last resort with his appeal against detention.",conclusion
"It is submitted that the applicant filed his application with the Commission on 1 September 1992, i.e. two months before 16 November 1992, the date on which the final decision on the matter had been notified to the applicant and on which consequently all domestic remedies had been exhausted.",premise
"Under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention ""the Commission may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken"".",premise
The Government maintain that the applicant has not complied with the requirements under Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,conclusion
The Commission notes that the Supreme Court in the final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992.,premise
The applicant then filed his submissions with the Commission on 1 and 8 September 1992.,premise
"On 17 September 1992 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's further appeal, though the Court stated that it was possible to file a complaint with the Prosecutor General.",premise
The applicant filed an appeal with the Prosecutor General which the latter dismissed on 11 November 1992.,premise
"Within six months of this date, i.e. on 7 May 1993, the applicant submitted his application form to the Commission.",premise
The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also complied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,conclusion
The applicant has therefore exhausted domestic remedies and also complied with the six months' time-limit as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention.,premise
It follows that the application can also not be declared inadmissible on these grounds.,conclusion
"The Commission recalls that any complaints about facts relating to a period prior to 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria, are incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.",premise
"In the present case, it is true that the Supreme Court in the final resort dismissed the applicant's appeal on 13 July 1992, i.e. before 7 September 1992, the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
"After the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant on 10 November 1992 filed a request for release from detention on remand which the Prosecutor General dismissed on 11 November 1992 on the ground that there were no new circumstances justifying modification of detention.",premise
"Rather, the acts of which he was accused concerned collective decisions of the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria over the period 1986-1989. Those decisions were taken within the constitutional powers of the Council of Ministers, and in accordance with the policies of the Bulgarian Government and the recommendations of the United Nations and their agencies.",conclusion
"In his view, confirmation herefor can be seen in the decision of 12 August 1992 which banned meetings between the applicant and his lawyers, thereby indicating that the true purpose of his detention was to restrict his right actively and freely to express his political views as a member of the National Assembly.",premise
The applicant also invokes Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention in that the purpose of his detention was political and did not correspond to the grounds listed under Bulgarian law.,conclusion
The Government submit that extending aid to Third World countries is not an offence under Bulgarian law.,premise
"However, this is not the correct formulation of the grounds in respect of which charges were brought against the applicant and other persons.",premise
"Rather, the charges were that, under the cover of development assistance, monies had been transferred in different ""deals"" which infringed Bulgaria's economic interests.",conclusion
"The Government also refer in this context to the Convention organs' case-law, in particular the Bozano case, according to which, where the Convention refers back to domestic law as in Article 5 para. 1 (c) (Art. 5-1-c), the Convention organs' supervisory powers are limited since it is in the first place for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Eur. Court H.R., judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, p. 25, para. 58).",premise
"The Government submit that the applicant's detention served no other purpose than that for which it was prescribed, as set out in Article 18 (Art. 18) of the Convention.",premise
"The domestic authorities strictly apply Bulgarian law equally to all persons, including the applicant.",conclusion
"He complains in particular that the authorities refused to take into account the recommendations of various medical experts; as a result, his health seriously deteriorated.",premise
"For instance, he suffered stenocardiac arrests and had worse basic indicators of his blood count.",premise
Twice he had to undergo treatment in the intensive care unit at the Sofia Military Hospital.,premise
He was sent to the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital despite the danger of infections posing a risk to his health and life.,premise
The applicant complains under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention of inhuman and degrading treatment which he allegedly suffered while remanded in custody.,conclusion
The applicant also complains of degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,premise
"Thus, it was impossible for him to meet relatives or members of his parliamentary group and of human rights organisations, and contacts with his lawyers were restricted.",conclusion
"The Commission notes that before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, medical reports were issued on the applicant's health between 18 and 28 August 1992.",premise
"Thereafter, further reports were issued on 16 September 1992 and on 2 October 1992.",premise
"These reports were prepared by numerous medical experts, among them the leading Bulgarian cardiologist.",premise
"It transpires from these reports that the applicant suffered from malignant chronic lympholeucosis, arterial hypertension and ischemia of the heart.",premise
"While the applicant had apparently suffered from angina pectoris, there was no sign of a myocardial infarct.",premise
"While the applicant's state of ill-health was serious, the Commission considers that his ailments were due to disorders which were mainly of a long-lasting nature.",conclusion
"In particular, a problem could arise under Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention if no, or only insufficient, treatment was available to him.",premise
"On 7 September 1992, i.e. the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria, the applicant was transferred from the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital to the National Investigation Service.",premise
"However, following a deterioration of his cardiovascular condition on 10 and 11 September 1992, he was taken to the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.",premise
In the medical report of 16 September 1992 it was found that the applicant should take certain medicaments and be placed in a hospital environment.,premise
The report of 2 October 1992 recommended certain medication and a convalescence period of three weeks under medical supervision at a hospital.,premise
"As a result, the applicant remained at the Higher Military Medical Institute until 30 November 1992 when he returned to the National Investigation Service.",premise
"A week later, when his health deteriorated, he was again taken to the Higher Military Medical Institute.",premise
On 30 December 1992 he was released from detention.,premise
"The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was monitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their recommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required medical treatment.",conclusion
"The Commission finds that the applicant's state of ill-health was monitored by numerous medical specialists, and that upon their recommendation he was placed in hospital where he received the required medical treatment.",premise
"Indeed, after 7 September 1992 most of his detention was spent in hospital.",premise
At one stage he was even brought to the intensive care unit of the Sofia Higher Military Medical Institute.,premise
"Insofar as the applicant submits that he risked infection, inter alia at the Sofia Penitentiary Hospital, he has not alleged that he was brought into close contact with persons suffering from contagious diseases, and indeed, it does not transpire that he was infected with any particular illness while in hospital.",premise
They continuously reviewed the detention arrangements employed with a view to ensuring the applicant's health as required by Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,premise
"On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the applicant's state of ill-health.",conclusion
"On the whole, the Bulgarian authorities reacted adequately to the applicant's state of ill-health.",premise
As a result the Commission considers that the manner in which the applicant underwent detention does not constitute treatment attaining the minimum level of severity falling within the scope of Article 3 (Art. 3) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The applicant complains under Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention that the Supreme Court, when considering his appeal on 13 July 1992, decided in camera without the applicant or other persons being present.",premise
"However, the fact complained of relates to a period prior to 7 September 1992 on which date the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
This part of the application is therefore incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2).,conclusion
The Commission notes that the proceedings instituted against the applicant have not yet been terminated.,premise
"He has not, therefore, been ""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1 (Art. 7-1) of the Convention.",conclusion
"He has not, therefore, been ""held guilty of any criminal offence"" as set out in Article 7 para. 1 (Art. 7-1) of the Convention.",premise
"The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.",conclusion
"The applicant cannot, therefore, be regarded as a victim of a violation of Article 7 (Art. 7) of the Convention.",premise
This part of the application is therefore manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
"The applicant refers here in particular to the Public Prosecutor's order of 12 August 1992 which, as a result of the applicant's article published on 11 August 1992, prohibited him from transmitting written materials to his lawyers.",premise
The prohibition was renewed in November 1992.,premise
The applicant submits that the order of 12 August 1992 was fully carried into effect until the end of August and in early September 1992.,premise
Under Article 10 (Art. 10) of the Convention the applicant complains that during detention he was prohibited from writing articles on issues irrelevant to the subject of the investigations.,conclusion
"In fact, there was no prohibition, only a limitation of the applicant's contacts with his lawyers.",premise
"While in detention the applicant wrote altogether 26 substantial newspaper articles, seven of which appeared after 7 September 1992, the date on which the Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
He also wrote a book which was published after his release.,premise
The Government submit that the restrictions of the applicant's freedom of expression corresponded to the requirements of detention.,conclusion
The Commission notes the applicant's submissions that this prohibition had its effects in August and in early September 1992.,premise
"In the Commission's opinion, the applicant has not sufficiently established any interferences with his right to freedom of expression after 7 September 1992, which is the date of the entry into force of the Convention in respect of Bulgaria.",premise
This aspect of the application is therefore incompatible ratione temporis with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 27 para. 2 (Art. 27-2) of the Convention.,conclusion
"(see No. 9044/80, Chartier v. Italy, Comm. Report 8.12.92, D.R. 33, p. 41 et seq., at p. 58).",premise
"Indeed, when preparing their reports, the experts also relied on previous reports on the applicant's health of the years 1988-1990.",premise
It has therefore not sufficiently been made out that the applicant's ailments arose as the direct consequence of his detention,conclusion
"It follows that the procedures of the Inter-Parliamentary Union do not constitute ""another procedure of international investigation or settlement"" within the meaning of Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention.",premise
"Accordingly, the present application cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 27 para. 1 (b) (Art. 27-1-b) of the Convention. b) In respect of the Commission's competence ratione temporis to examine his application, the applicant submits that, while the facts complained of originated before 7 September 1992, i.e. the date when Bulgaria ratified the Convention, the situation complained of continued after the Convention had entered into force in respect of Bulgaria.",conclusion
