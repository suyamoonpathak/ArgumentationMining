The Commission recalls that Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention only requires the exhaustion of such remedies which relate to the breaches of the Convention alleged and at the same time can provide effective and sufficient redress.,premise
"An applicant does not need to exercise remedies which, although theoretically of a nature to constitute remedies, do not in reality offer any chance of redressing the alleged breach (cf. No. 9248/81, Dec. 10.10.83, D.R. 34 p. 78).",conclusion
The Commission notes that in the context of the section 9 powers the Secretary of State has a very wide discretion.,premise
It appears that he has only exercised his discretion under section 9 in five cases and that there is no example of any enforcement of those directions being pursued in the courts.,premise
The Commission finds that the suggested application for discretionary relief in the instant case cannot do so either.,conclusion
"The Commission recalls that in the case of Temple v. the United Kingdom (No. 10530/83, Dec. 16.5.85, D.R. 42 p. 171) the Commission held that recourse to a purely discretionary power on the part of the Secretary of State did not constitute an effective domestic remedy.",premise
The Commission finds that the suggested application for discretionary relief in the instant case cannot do so either.,conclusion
"It considers that the applicant's complaints raise serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which should depend on an examination of the merits.",premise
It follows that the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded.,conclusion
as required by Article 26 (Art. 26) of the Convention,premise
"since she has not applied to the Secretary of State to exercise his power under section 9 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to direct a local authority to comply with its statutory duty to provide such sites and if necessary, to enforce such directions in the courts.",premise
"Insofar as the applicant complains of the alleged shortfall of official sites for gypsies in the Willingham area, the Government submit that the applicant has not exhausted domestic remedies",conclusion
"The Secretary of State's power under section 9 is, she contends, discretionary and rarely exercised.",premise
The applicant submits there are no effective remedies which she is obliged to exhaust.,conclusion
"To the extent that there might have been any interference with her rights under Article 8 para. 1 (Art. 8-1), the Government consider that the refusal of planning permission and issue of the enforcement notices are justified by the interests of public safety on the road, the economic well-being of the country and the protection of the environment.",premise
"As for the framework of regulation, including the designation system, this is stated to represent a proportionate response to the need to protect public safety on the roads as well as the rights of others.",premise
The Government contend that the applicant cannot be considered a victim of any violation of her rights under Article 8 paragraph 1 (Art. 8-1),conclusion
under Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention.,premise
"The applicant complains of a violation of her right to respect for her family life, private life and home",conclusion
"As a result, the applicant contends that she has nowhere she can legally or safely go.",premise
"The applicant complains of a violation of her right to respect for her family life, private life and home",conclusion
She submits that there is an acknowledged shortfall of sites for gypsies in South Cambridgeshire and that local authorities are failing to fulfil their statutory duty to provide sites.,premise
"The applicant also contends that it is a practical impossibility for her to station her caravans on her sister's site and that even if there were vacant pitches on the nearby official site, it is overcrowded and has a reputation for violence which renders it an unsafe location for a single woman living alone with her children.",premise
"Further, the designation system which discriminates against gypsies prevents her moving onto unoccupied land or stationing her caravans near the highway.",premise
"As a result, the applicant contends that she has nowhere she can legally or safely go.",conclusion
"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",premise
It follows that the application cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded.,premise
"For these reasons, the Commission by a majority DECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits.",conclusion
"(cf. Eur. Court. H.R., Deweer judgment of 27 February 1980, Series A no. 35, p. 15, para. 26, and No. 9013/80, Dec. 11.12.82, D.R. 30 p. 96, at p. 102).",premise
It is furthermore established that the burden of proving the existence of available and sufficient domestic remedies lies upon the State invoking the rule,conclusion

"In these circumstances, the Commission finds that the application cannot be declared inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.",conclusion
since as a matter of fact she was and is able to live either on the neighbouring land lawfully occupied by her sister or to apply for a place on one of the many other local authority and private gipsy caravan sites throughout Cambridgeshire.,premise
She also has not been subject to any of the criminal sanctions which may applied under the designation system.,premise
"Further, they point out that applicant took up residence on her land without prior planning permission.",premise
They consider that the applicant cannot claim as a member of a minority group to be immune from general planning control.,conclusion
"She invokes Article 8 (Art. 8) of the Convention which provides: ""1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""",premise
The applicant complains that she is prevented from living with her family in caravans on her land and from pursuing her traditional way of life as a gypsy.,conclusion

The particular circumstances of the case,non-argumentative
"The applicant is a British citizen born in 1964 and resident in Willingham. She is represented before the Commission by Mr. Luke Clements, a solicitor practising in Hereford.",non-argumentative
The facts as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows.,non-argumentative
The applicant is a gypsy by birth.,non-argumentative
Her family has for many generations been based in the area of South Cambridgeshire near Willingham.,non-argumentative
"Until 1988, the applicant had no fixed abode but travelled in caravans throughout the Willingham area.",non-argumentative
"In 1988 Mr. and Mrs. Buckley (who is the applicant's sister) acquired a one acre site in the Willingham area from a Mr. and Mrs. S., who had applied for and been refused, retrospective planning permission for a single caravan.",non-argumentative
"In May 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Buckley applied retrospectively for planning permission to have one residential caravan on the frontage of their one acre site.",non-argumentative
Permission was given on a personal temporary basis.,non-argumentative
"In November 1988, a further retrospective application was made for three caravans.",non-argumentative
These were occupied by the applicant and her three children.,non-argumentative
Permission was given in January 1989 on a personal temporary basis.,non-argumentative
"On an unspecified date in 1988, the applicant acquired part of the land belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Buckley.",non-argumentative
"In October 1989 on the part of the land acquired by the applicant, there were three caravans occupied by the applicant, her children and her mother.",non-argumentative
A retrospective planning application in respect of the three caravans was submitted on 4 December 1989.,non-argumentative
While it was under consideration the fourth caravan occupied by the applicant's brother moved on to the site.,non-argumentative
"The application was refused by the District Council on 8 March 1990 on the basis that adequate provision had been made for gypsy caravans elsewhere, that the planned use of the land would detract from the rural and open quality of the landscape and that the access to the site was too narrow to allow two vehicles to pass.",non-argumentative
An enforcement notice was issued by the District Council for the caravans to be removed to take effect on 15 May 1990.,non-argumentative
The applicant appealed against the enforcement notice to the Secretary of State for the Environment.,non-argumentative
"In a decision dated 16 April 1991 based on an inspector's report, the Secretary of State dismissed the appeal, finding that the objections to the continued use of the site for caravans were so strong on planning and highway safety grounds that the grant of permission could not be justified.",non-argumentative
He found also that the concentration of gypsy sites in the area had reached the desirable maximum and the need for additional sites for gypsies should not outweigh the planning and highway objections.,non-argumentative
The inspector also referred to the fact that the applicant had planning permission to station a caravan on an adjoining approved site.,non-argumentative
The applicant did not appeal to the High Court since this appeal lies only on points of law and she was advised that no grounds arose in her case.,non-argumentative
The applicant was served with a summons for failure to comply with the enforcement notice on 9 September 1991.,non-argumentative
"At the hearing in the Magistrates' Court on 7 January 1992, the applicant pleaded guilty on the advice of her solicitor and was fined £50 with £10 costs.",non-argumentative
The applicant has not moved and another enforcement notice is imminent.,non-argumentative
"By letter dated 20 May 1993, the Department of the Environment informed the District Council that the Secretary of State had decided to designate the area of South Cambridgeshire under section 12 of the Caravan Sites Act 1968.",non-argumentative
Designation was granted on the basis of the Council's assurance that they will apply their powers humanely and give sympathetic consideration to applications for gypsy sites.,non-argumentative
"It was noted that a small number of gypsies still remained on unauthorised sites but that, in light of the provision made for sites which is greater than in any other district, it was considered ""not expedient for adequate accommodation to be provided for gypsies residing in or resorting to South Cambridgeshire District",non-argumentative
The Order designating the district of South Cambridgeshire came into force on 13 August 1993.,non-argumentative
The applicant was prosecuted for breach of an enforcement notice on 12 January 1994.,non-argumentative

"The Secretary of State may, if at any time it appears to him to be necessary so to do, give directions to any local authority to which subsection 1 of section 6 of this Act applies requiring them to provide pursuant to that section, such sites or additional sites, for the accommodation of such numbers of caravans, as may be specified in the directions; and any such directions shall be enforceable, on the application of the Secretary of State, by mandamus",non-argumentative
The Secretary of State has made directions to a local authority under section 9 on five occasions.,non-argumentative
No application has ever been made to the courts to enforce any such directions.,non-argumentative

"An order under this section may authorise the local authority to take such steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that the order is complied with and in particular, may authorise the authority, by its officers and servants",non-argumentative
to enter upon the land specified in the order; and,non-argumentative
"to take, in relation to any caravan to be removed pursuant to the order, such steps for securing entry and rendering it suitable for removal as may be so specified ...",non-argumentative
The applicant complains that she and her family are being prevented from living in her caravans on her own land and from following the traditional lifestyle of a gypsy.,non-argumentative
