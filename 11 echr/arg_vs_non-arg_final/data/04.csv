he had left the Government Employment Training Scheme in March 1990 and that he had not had gainful employment since then;,non-argumentative
he had applied for Income Support but had been refused;,non-argumentative
he had no personal assets or income.,non-argumentative
"On the basis of this evidence (which was accepted as true), the Magistrates concluded that the applicant's failure to pay the community charge was due to his culpable neglect ""as he clearly had the potential to earn money to discharge his obligation to pay"". They issued a warrant committing the applicant to prison for 30 days.",non-argumentative
"On 28 March 1991 a solicitor, who was informed about the facts, appeared (without payment) before the same bench of the Magistrates' Court and applied for bail on the applicant's behalf, but this was refused.",non-argumentative
"As the High Court is not seized of an appeal by way of case stated until the Magistrates' Court has actually stated a case and it has been lodged in the High Court, on 4 April 1991 the solicitor lodged a further application in the High Court for judicial review of the Magistrates' Court's decision, as this would allow for an immediate bail application.",non-argumentative
"On 5 April 1991 the application for bail was heard before a High Court judge and the applicant was granted bail, while on 16 April 1991 leave to apply for judicial review was also granted.",non-argumentative
"On 7 and 8 October 1991, the High Court heard the two applications, that is, the appeal by way of case stated and the application for judicial review.",non-argumentative

"Whether, before issuing the said warrant, we conducted an adequate inquiry into the appellant's means.",non-argumentative
"Whether we acted reasonably in exercising our discretion to issue the said warrant"".",non-argumentative
"In connection with these questions, the High Court found:",non-argumentative
In certain circumstances a failure on the part of the debtor to work and put himself in funds to pay the Community Charge might constitute culpable neglect.,non-argumentative
"In my judgment however, before such a finding could be sustained, at the very least there would have to be clear evidence that gainful employment, for which he was fit, was on offer to the debtor and that he had rejected or refused that offer.",non-argumentative
There was no such evidence in this case.,non-argumentative
"In my judgment, the justices' findings of culpable neglect cannot be sustained on the evidence adduced before them. ...",non-argumentative
"In the present case the justices found that the applicant had no income and no assets at the time that he appeared before them, that being the relevant time for them when considering whether they should issue a warrant so as to commit the appellant to prison.",non-argumentative

Regulation 41 of the Community Charges (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1989 provides as follows:,non-argumentative
"Where a charging authority had sought to levy an amount by distress under Regulation 39, the debtor is an individual, and it appears to the authority that no (or insufficient) goods of the debtor can be found on which to levy the amount, the authority may apply to a Magistrates' Court for the issue of a warrant committing the debtor to prison.",non-argumentative
"On such application being made, the court shall (in the debtor's presence) inquire as to his means and inquire whether the failure to pay which led to the liability order concerned being made against him was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.",non-argumentative
"If (and only if) the court is of the opinion that his failure was due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect it may if it thinks fit - (a) issue a warrant of commitment against the debtor, or (b) fix a term of imprisonment and postpone the issue of a warrant until such time and on such conditions (if any) as the court thinks just.",non-argumentative
"In Re McC the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords held that Magistrates acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction and would be liable in damages where an individual could show that the Magistrates had no jurisdiction over the cause at all, that they exercised their powers in a procedural manner that involved a gross and obvious irregularity, or that the order of the court was not based on any proper foundation of law because of failure to observe a statutory condition precedent ([1985] AC 528).",non-argumentative
The Magistrates were therefore liable in damages for the applicant's unlawful imprisonment.,non-argumentative
"In a case concerning rates, the predecessor to the community charge (R. v. Manchester City Magistrates Court, ex parte Davies [1989] All ER 30), the Court of Appeal found that where Magistrates failed to make proper inquiry as to whether failure to pay rates was due to wilful refusal or culpable neglect, they had failed to observe a statutory condition precedent and therefore acted outside or in excess of their jurisdiction.",non-argumentative

"The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 1 of the Convention in that he was unlawfully detained by the Magistrates, who acted beyond their jurisdiction (cf. R. v. Manchester City Magistrates Court, ex parte Davies).",non-argumentative
"As a result of the amendment to the law brought about by Section 108 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, no action lies against Magistrates in respect of such unlawful detention.",non-argumentative
The applicant alleges a violation of Article 5 para. 5 of the Convention in this respect.,non-argumentative
"Under Article 6 of the Convention, the applicant considers that, regardless of whether the proceedings are civil or criminal, he should have been entitled to legal aid before the Magistrates.",non-argumentative

The Commission has taken cognizance of the parties' submissions.,non-argumentative
No other grounds for inadmissibility have been established.,non-argumentative
The Government submit that the question does not arise as there is no violation of any provision of Article 5 (Art. 5) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
The Commission has declared admissible the applicant's complaints under Article 5 para. 1 (Art. 5-1) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
"It finds that the question whether the applicant's right under Article 5 para. 5 (Art. 5-5) of the Convention was violated also raises complex issues of fact and law, which require further examination on the merits.",non-argumentative
No other grounds for inadmissibility have been established.,non-argumentative
The Government submit that the proceedings were not criminal.,non-argumentative
"They further consider that the committal proceedings themselves did not determine the applicant's civil rights and obligations, but were merely execution of the civil judgment brought about by the liability order in the case.",non-argumentative
"They submit that the combined effect of assistance under the Green Form scheme and ABWOR complies with the requirements of Article 6 (Art. 6) of the Convention, even if this Convention provision applies to the proceedings.",non-argumentative
