"In Mr Palaoro's submission, the administrative criminal offence of which he was accused gave rise to a ""criminal charge"".",argumentative
"Like the Commission, the Court notes that, although the offences in issue and the procedures followed in the case fall within the administrative sphere, they are nevertheless criminal in nature.",argumentative
This is moreover reflected in the terminology employed.,argumentative
Thus Austrian law refers to administrative offences (Verwaltungsstraftaten) and administrative criminal procedure (Verwaltungsstrafverfahren).,argumentative
"In addition, the fine imposed on the applicant was accompanied by an order for his committal to prison in the event of his defaulting on payment (see paragraph 18 above).",argumentative
"These considerations are sufficient to establish that the offence of which the applicant was accused may be classified as ""criminal"" for the purposes of the Convention.",argumentative
"There could be no doubt that by the reference in that reservation to ""measures for the deprivation of liberty"" the Austrian Government had meant to include proceedings resulting in such measures.",argumentative
"Any other construction would not only lack coherence; it would also run counter to the authorities' intention, which had been to remove from the scope of the Convention the whole administrative system, including the substantive and procedural provisions of administrative criminal law.",argumentative
"That would be so even in a case where, as in this instance, the accused was merely fined, in so far as default on payment of that fine would entail committal to prison.",argumentative
"Admittedly, the Road Traffic Act 1960 was not one of the four laws designated in the reservation.",argumentative
"However, one of those laws, the Administrative Criminal Justice Act, stated in section 10 that, except as otherwise provided, the general administrative laws were to determine the nature and severity of sanctions.",argumentative
"It mattered little in this respect that sections 20 and 52 of the Road Traffic Act, which were applied in the present case, had been enacted after the reservation had been deposited, because those provisions merely clarified the substance of an existing obligation laid down in the Traffic Police Act 1947.",argumentative
"According to the Government, the procedure in question was covered by Austria's reservation in respect of Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention.",argumentative
"In the first place, it failed to satisfy the requirements of Article 64 (art. 64) of the Convention, which provides:",argumentative
"Any State may, when signing [the] Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision.",argumentative
Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article (art. 64).,argumentative
"Any reservation made under this Article (art. 64) shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned.""",argumentative
The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.,argumentative
"Secondly, on a strict construction, its wording precluded extending its scope to the procedural sphere, which was in issue here.",argumentative
The applicant argued that the reservation could not apply in the present case.,argumentative
"It therefore remains only to ascertain whether the provisions applied (art. 5, art. 64) in the present case are covered by that reservation.",argumentative
They differ in certain essential respects from those in issue in the Chorherr case.,argumentative
"The Court notes that Mr Palaoro based his complaints on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, whereas the wording of the reservation invoked by the Government mentions only Article 5 (art. 5) and makes express reference solely to measures for the deprivation of liberty.",argumentative
"Moreover, the reservation only comes into play where both substantive and procedural provisions of one or more of the four specific laws indicated in it have been applied.",argumentative
"Here, however, the substantive provisions of a different Act, the Road Traffic Act 1960, were applied.",argumentative
These considerations are a sufficient basis for concluding that the reservation in question does not apply in the instant case.,argumentative
"This was true not only of the administrative authorities, but also of the Constitutional Court, whose review was confined to constitutional issues, and above all of the Administrative Court.",argumentative
"The latter was bound by the administrative authorities' findings of fact, except where there was a procedural defect within the meaning of section 42(2), sub-paragraph 3, of the Administrative Court Act (see paragraph 24 above).",argumentative
"It was therefore not empowered to take evidence itself, or to establish the facts, or to take cognisance of new matters.",argumentative
"Moreover, in the event of its quashing an administrative measure, it was not entitled to substitute its own decision for that of the authority concerned, but had always to remit the case to that authority.",argumentative
"In short, its review was confined exclusively to questions of law and therefore could not be regarded as equivalent to that of a body with full jurisdiction.",argumentative
"Mr Palaoro contended that none of the bodies that had dealt with his case in the proceedings in issue could be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).",argumentative
"The Court reiterates that decisions taken by administrative authorities which do not themselves satisfy the requirements of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention - as is the case in this instance with the district authority and the regional government (see paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 above) - must be subject to subsequent control by a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"" (see, inter alia and mutatis mutandis, the following judgments:",argumentative
"Albert and Le Compte v. Belgium of 10 February 1983, Series A no. 58, p. 16, para. 29; Öztürk, previously cited, pp. 21-22, para. 56; and Fischer v. Austria of 26 April 1995, Series A no. 312, p. 17, para. 28).",argumentative
The Constitutional Court is not such a body.,argumentative
"In the present case it could look at the impugned proceedings only from the point of view of their conformity with the Constitution, and this did not enable it to examine all the relevant facts.",argumentative
It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).,argumentative
The powers of the Administrative Court must be assessed in the light of the fact that the court in this case was sitting in proceedings that were of a criminal nature for the purposes of the Convention.,argumentative
"It follows that when the compatibility of those powers with Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) is being gauged, regard must be had to the complaints raised in that court by the applicant as well as to the defining characteristics of a ""judicial body that has full jurisdiction"".",argumentative
"These include the power to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and law, the decision of the body below.",argumentative
"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention.",argumentative
It accordingly lacked the powers required under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1).,argumentative
"As the Administrative Court lacks that power, it cannot be regarded as a ""tribunal"" within the meaning of the Convention.",argumentative
"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"".",argumentative
"It follows that the applicant did not have access to a ""tribunal"".",argumentative
There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) on this point.,argumentative
"(see the Hauschildt v. Denmark judgment of 24 May 1989, Series A no. 154, p. 24, para. 57; the Saïdi v. France judgment of 20 September 1993, Series A no. 261-C, p. 58, para. 49; and the Fischer judgment, previously cited, p. 21, para. 47).",argumentative

Austria , The European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Article 43 (art. 43) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (""the Convention"") and the relevant provisions of Rules of Court A , as a Chamber composed of the following judges:",non-argumentative
"It originated in an application (no. 16718/90) against the Republic of Austria lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by an Austrian national, Mr Peter Palaoro, on 28 May 1990.",non-argumentative
"The Commission's request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby Austria recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46).",non-argumentative
The object of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention.,non-argumentative
"In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 para. 3 (d) of Rules of Court A, the applicant stated that he wished to take part in the proceedings and designated the lawyer who would represent him (Rule 30).",non-argumentative
"On 24 September 1994, the President of the Court decided, under Rule 21 para. 6 and in the interests of the proper administration of justice, that a single Chamber should be constituted to hear the instant case and the cases of Schmautzer, Umlauft, Gradinger, Pramstaller and Pfarrmeier v. Austria .",non-argumentative
"The Chamber to be constituted for this purpose included ex officio Mr F. Matscher, the elected judge of Austrian nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 para. 3 (b)).",non-argumentative

Mr lives at Höchst in Vorarlberg.,non-argumentative
On 7 November 1987 a police car observed the applicant driving on the motorway at speeds considerably in excess of the maximum speed limits.,non-argumentative
At 14.28 hours and 53 seconds he was recorded travelling at 150 kilometres per hour on a stretch of road where a sign indicated the limit to be 100 k.p.h.,non-argumentative
Thirty-one seconds later he was recorded travelling at 67 k.p.h. over the general 130 k.p.h. limit for motorways.,non-argumentative
"The applicant alleged that as the vehicle he was driving was an extremely powerful one, it was difficult for the driver to realise at what speed it was actually travelling.",non-argumentative
On 6 December 1987 the Tyrol regional police authority (Landesgendarmeriekommando) drew up a report and imposed two separate fines on the applicant for speeding.,non-argumentative
"On 16 November 1988, after administrative proceedings which involved an examination of the reporting police officers (Meldungsleger) in the absence of the applicant, the Imst district authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) found the applicant guilty of two speeding offences under the Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsordnung - see paragraph 17 below).",non-argumentative
"The applicant appealed to the Tyrol regional government (Amt der Landesregierung), questioning the precision of the police methods for measuring vehicle speed.",non-argumentative
"He further contended that, having admitted driving at a high speed on a given stretch of road, he should not have been punished under two different provisions, which had resulted in an excessively high fine.",non-argumentative
"On 22 December 1988 the Tyrol regional government reduced the fines to ATS 2,000 and 4,000 respectively, and the penalties in default to four and seven days' imprisonment.",non-argumentative
He therefore requested that the incident be treated as a single offence and the fine reduced accordingly.,non-argumentative
"Pursuant to section 99(3) of that Act (see paragraph 18 below) the applicant was fined 4,000 and 6,000 Austrian schillings (ATS), with imprisonment of eight and ten days respectively in default of payment.",non-argumentative

Mr Palaoro then applied to the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof).,non-argumentative
"Relying on Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention, he complained that the administrative criminal procedure did not guarantee a fair trial.",non-argumentative
He argued that he should have been given an oral hearing and the opportunity to examine the witnesses - that is to say the police officers - in person.,non-argumentative
"He further criticised the ""principle of cumulative imposition of penalties"" (Kumulationsprinzip), by virtue of which the same criminal behaviour could be punished under different provisions.",non-argumentative

"Among other provisions, Article 144 para. 2 of the Federal Constitution was applied (see paragraph 20 below).",non-argumentative
On 19 April 1989 Mr Palaoro requested the Constitutional Court to send his file to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof) and on 15 June 1989 he submitted his grounds of appeal to the latter.,non-argumentative
