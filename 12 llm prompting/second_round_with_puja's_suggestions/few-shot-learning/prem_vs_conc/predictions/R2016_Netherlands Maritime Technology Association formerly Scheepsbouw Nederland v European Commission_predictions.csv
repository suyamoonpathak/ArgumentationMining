"As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it must be pointed out that, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court correctly set out that argument, stating, inter alia, that the appellant was arguing that the Commission had not assessed the effect of the notified measure in its context.",prem,conclusion,premise
The appellant is claiming that it is apparent therefore from that paragraph that the Commission had confined itself to studying the effect of that measure in isolation.,prem,conclusion,premise
"Further, the General Court investigated, in paragraphs 81 to 83 of the judgment under appeal, whether the Commission had taken account of the combined effect of the previous provisions and other provisions, fiscal and non-fiscal.",prem,conclusion,premise
"In that regard, the General Court held that the Commission had examined, in recitals 16 to 23 of the contested decision, the relevance of the previous provisions in relation to the notified measure.",prem,conclusion,premise
"In particular, the General Court held, in paragraph 83 of that judgment, that, given that the previous early depreciation scheme provisions were to be repealed and the application of the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS no longer required prior authorisation from the tax authorities, the question of the combined effects of the previous provisions simply no longer arose.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The General Court cannot therefore be criticised for having misconstrued arguments raised before it by the appellant that concerned specifically, as is apparent from, inter alia, the application initiating the proceedings, the analysis of the combined effects of the tax measures and other provisions, fiscal and non-fiscal.",prem,conclusion,premise
"For the remainder, the General Court did not for all that limit its examination to the previous early depreciation scheme.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Thus, in paragraphs 84 to 88 of the judgment under appeal, it set out the appellant’s arguments on the de facto selectivity of the notified measure, to be analysed in the following paragraphs in order to come to the conclusion, in paragraph 92 of that judgment, that, with regard to the new tax scheme, ‘the Commission examined the question of whether the notified measure contained an element of selectivity’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"While the General Court considered that examination to have been ‘succinct’, it nonetheless held that examination to have been sufficient, on the conclusion of reasoned argument set out in paragraphs 93 to 101 of that judgment, where the new tax provisions are dealt with.",prem,conclusion,premise
"That being the case, the first part of the appellant’s first ground of appeal stems from a misreading of the judgment under appeal and must be rejected.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"As regards the second part of that ground of appeal, it is clear that the appellant claimed before the General Court that the fact that a measure is directly applicable and leaves no discretion to the authorities responsible for its implementation does not preclude that measure being selective.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The appellant argued, in addition, that the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS was not directly applicable, since it contained a number of concepts that were subject to interpretation.",prem,conclusion,premise
"In this instance, first, it is clear that that argument of the appellant is clearly stated in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Second, the General Court replied to that argument in paragraph 82 of that judgment, holding that the Commission had assessed whether the application of the notified measure required prior authorisation or any implementation measures.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Accordingly, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"Last, as regards the third part of this ground of appeal, it is clear that the plea in law relied on by the appellant at first instance was designed to establish that the Commission had not undertaken a complete and sufficient examination of the selectivity of the measure at issue.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Suffice it to observe that, in paragraph 91 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court described the examination carried out by the Commission in order to determine whether the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS contained an element of selectivity.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The General Court concluded, in paragraph 92 of that judgment, that the Commission had indeed ‘examined the question of whether the notified measure contained an element of selectivity’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Further, in paragraphs 93 to 101 of that judgment, the General Court set out the reasons why it held that examination to be sufficient.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Accordingly, the General Court cannot be criticised of having failed to state the reasons why it held that the examination undertaken by the Commission was sufficient.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"Further, as regards the argument concerning the selectivity of the measure at issue with respect to certain kinds of undertakings, suffice it to observe that the General Court, in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, considered that the Commission was not required to make such an assessment, since the benefit of the early depreciation provided for in the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS is open to any kind of undertaking.",prem,conclusion,premise
"It must also be stated, with respect to, in particular, the argument that the General Court failed to take into consideration the differentiation between leasing companies and certain investors, that the reasoning followed by the General Court, in paragraphs 91 to 101 of the judgment under appeal, necessarily implies the rejection of the arguments put forward by the appellant.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"Since the General Court is not required to reply exhaustively to each of the arguments put forward before it by the parties, it cannot be criticised of not having stated reasons for its findings (see, to that effect, the judgment in Gogos v Commission, C‑583/08 P, EU:C:2010:287, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).",prem,conclusion,premise
"Consequently, the third part of the first ground of appeal must also be rejected.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"As regards the first argument, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, in proceedings for annulment, the General Court cannot substitute its own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act (see judgments in DIR International Film and Others v Commission, C‑164/98 P, EU:C:2000:48, paragraph 38, and British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 141).",prem,conclusion,premise
"In this case, the General Court held, in paragraph 97 of the judgment under appeal, that those who are likely to benefit from the notified measure are the lessees, that is, the undertakings who pay the regular instalments required by that type of contract.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The General Court observed, however, that since that measure was in principle applicable, as the Commission held in recitals 28 to 32 of the contested decision, to any undertaking of any size, active in any sector of the economy, there was therefore no need for the Commission’s examination to concern the leasing companies or the undertakings that the appellant classifies as ‘intermediaries’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Accordingly, it must be held that the General Court did not substitute its reasoning for that of the Commission with respect to the beneficiaries of that measure.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"As regards the second argument, it must be observed that that argument was properly presented in paragraphs 84 to 87 of the judgment under appeal and that the General Court replied to it in paragraphs 91 and 92 of that judgment, holding that the amended Article 115(11) of the LIS applied to a category of assets that was open and indeterminate.",prem,conclusion,premise
"In particular, the General Court set out, in paragraph 91 of that judgment, the reasons that led the Commission to hold that that provision was a general measure that did not confer a selective advantage on its beneficiaries.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Further, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, and the reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the General Court has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see judgment in FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission, C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P, EU:C:2008:476, paragraph 96 and the case-law cited).",prem,conclusion,premise
"It is clear that, by the third ground of appeal, the appellant is not arguing that the reasons stated in the judgment under appeal are insufficient, but is criticising the reasons stated by General Court as being, in its opinion, flawed in several respects.",prem,conclusion,premise
"As regards the first part of the third ground of appeal, the appellant disputes the statement made by the General Court, in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the status of the EIGs was not challenged by the Opening Decision’, principally on the ground that that statement is of no relevance in so far as it relates to the previous early depreciation scheme, which is not the subject matter of the contested decision, and, alternatively, that the statement is not correct.",prem,conclusion,premise
"It must be observed that the General Court held, in paragraph 93 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the new version of Article 115(11) of the LIS is self-standing’ and that ‘[t]he answer to the question of whether the notified measure conferred a selective advantage cannot therefore be dependent on the effect of [the] previous provisions.",prem,conclusion,premise
It follows that it was no longer necessary to examine the question of whether it might be selective by comparison with the previous early depreciation scheme.’,prem,conclusion,conclusion
"Further, the General Court stated, in paragraph 95 of that judgment, that ‘the benefit of the early depreciation provided for by the notified measure is available to any kind of undertaking’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"It is apparent from reading paragraphs 93 and 95 of the judgment under appeal together, first, that those reasons are sufficient to justify, in law, rejection of the appellant’s argument that an insufficient examination was made, in the contested decision, of the situation of the EIGs.",prem,conclusion,premise
"It follows, secondly, that the statement that ‘the status of the EIGs was not challenged by the Opening Decision’, made in paragraph 95 of the judgment under appeal, was made for the sake of completeness.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"Consequently, the first part of the third ground of appeal, in that it is directed against a reason stated for the sake of completeness, must be rejected as being ineffective.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"By the second part of this ground of appeal, the appellant disputes the validity of the reasoning in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which, in its opinion, is flawed.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The appellant claims that the tax scheme at issue confers, de facto, a selective advantage on a limited number of undertakings.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Consequently, the General Court should have examined the possibility of de facto selectivity.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"However, it is clear that the General Court stated, in paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the notified measure is a general tax measure’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The General Court set out, in paragraphs 90 and 99 of that judgment, the relevant principles stemming from the case-law, which principles have not been challenged by the appellant in its appeal.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The General Court, in paragraph 91 of that judgment, rejected the appellant’s arguments as to the insufficiency of the examination by the Commission of the selectivity of the national measure at issue.",prem,conclusion,premise
"That being the case, the General Court was entitled to take the view, in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, that the criteria of the previously cited case-law did not apply to the notified measure as regards whether it should be defined as conferring a selective advantage, and that ‘there was no need for the Commission to define a reference framework in order to analyse the effect of the notified measure’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Accordingly, the second part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"As regards the third part of that ground of appeal, directed against paragraphs 107 and 111 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant claims, in essence, that General Court failed to assess whether the Commission had examined the selectivity of the notified measure with all due diligence.",prem,conclusion,premise
"It must be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the concept of ‘State aid’ does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the overall structure of the system of which they are part (judgments in Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 145 and the case-law cited, and BNP Paribas and BNL v Commission, C‑452/10 P, EU:C:2012:366, paragraph 101).",prem,conclusion,premise
"In carrying out the necessary comprehensive review of the characterisation of the tax scheme at issue as State aid, the General Court had to examine whether the differentiation between undertakings arising from that scheme was due to the nature or general scheme of the tax system of which it formed part (judgment in BNP Paribas and BNL v Commission, C‑452/10 P, EU:C:2012:366, paragraph 102).",prem,conclusion,premise
"In this case, it is apparent from paragraphs 102 to 105 of the judgment under appeal that the appellant disputed the finding, in paragraphs 31 and 32 of the contested decision, that any selectivity of the notified measure is inherent in the general tax scheme and justified by the logic of that scheme.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The appellant considered that that analysis was contrary, on the one hand, to the Commission’s previous decision-making practice and, on the other, to the notice.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The General Court responded to that argument, in paragraphs 107 to 111 of the judgment under appeal, as follows:

‘107 It must be observed that, according to paragraph 31 of the contested decision, the conditions imposed by the notified measure restrict the possibility of early depreciation to certain assets.",prem,conclusion,premise
"The Commission considered, however, that those restrictions were justified by factors relating to the period of construction of a custom-built asset and the need to meet pre-financing costs during that period.",prem,conclusion,premise
"108 That explanation can readily be understood, particularly if the notified measure is compared to Article 115(6) of the LIS concerning accelerated depreciation.",prem,conclusion,premise
The new version of Article 115(11) of the LIS derogates from that provision only to the extent that it allows the possibility of altering the date from which that accelerated depreciation is to occur.,prem,conclusion,premise
Article 115(6) of the LIS allows the accelerated depreciation of assets financed by a leasing contract only from the date on which the asset is actually available.,prem,conclusion,premise
"However, given that, as regards custom-built assets which are the subject of the new version of Article 115(11) of the LIS, the greater part of the payment has already been made before that date, it is coherent to bring the date of depreciation into line with that of the payments to the leasing company.",prem,conclusion,premise
"109 Contrary to what is claimed by [the appellant], the principles established by the Commission in paragraph 23 of [the notice] do not preclude that explanation.",prem,conclusion,premise
"On the contrary, that notice allows differentiation within a tax system, provided that it is supported by a rational justification.",prem,conclusion,premise
"110 Further, the Commission was not obliged to follow the analytical approaches which it had used in its decisions on depreciation in Germany and on depreciation in Spain of financial goodwill, referred to above in paragraphs 103 and 105 respectively [of the judgment under appeal], contrary to what is argued by [the appellant].",prem,conclusion,premise
"Each case must be assessed separately according to the particular circumstances of the case (judgment of 1 July 2009 in KG Holding and Others v Commission, T‑81/07 to T‑83/07, ECR, EU:T:2009:237, paragraph 201).",prem,conclusion,premise
"111 Last, as regards [the appellant’s] argument that the restriction of early depreciation to assets financed through leasing contracts is not objectively justified, it is clear that Article 115 of the LIS governs only leasing contracts.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Consequently, the notified measure could concern only leasing contracts and not other forms of financing.’",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"It is apparent from those reasons that, having set out the arguments made by the appellant, the General Court rejected them following an overall assessment in paragraphs 107 to 109 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Moreover, in paragraphs 110 and 111 of that judgment, the General Court responded specifically to the appellant’s arguments concerning the Commission’s previous decision-making practice and the significance of leasing contracts for the analysis of the notified measure.",prem,conclusion,premise
"Accordingly, the General Court justified its conclusion to the requisite legal standard, and it cannot be held that the General Court was obliged to extend its assessment of the selectivity of the notified measure by adding an exhaustive examination of each of the criteria governing eligibility for that measure.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
The General Court did not therefore err in law in the exercise of its review of whether the differentiation between undertakings caused by the scheme at issue was not caused by the nature or structure of the tax system of which it formed part.,prem,conclusion,premise
"Accordingly, the third part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.",prem,conclusion,conclusion
"As regards the fourth part of that ground of appeal, the appellant complains that the General Court contradicted the notice, since the General Court held, in paragraph 109 of the judgment under appeal, that that notice allows differentiation within a tax system, provided that that differentiation is supported by a rational justification.",prem,conclusion,premise
"In that regard, it must be observed that paragraph 23 of the notice states that ‘The differential nature of some measures does not necessarily mean that they must be considered to be State aid.",prem,conclusion,premise
This is the case with measures whose economic rationale makes them necessary to the functioning and effectiveness of the tax system.,prem,conclusion,premise
"However, it is up to the Member State to provide such justification’.",prem,conclusion,premise
"It is clear, on the one hand, that the General Court set out, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the wording of that paragraph 23 and, on the other, that the expression ‘rational justification’ used in paragraph 109 of that judgment, corresponds, in essence, to the criterion stated in paragraph 23 of the notice.",prem,conclusion,premise
It follows from all the foregoing that the first ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded.,conc,conclusion,conclusion
"Accordingly, the second ground of appeal must be rejected in its entirety as being unfounded.",conc,conclusion,conclusion
"Consequently, the fourth part of the third ground of appeal must be rejected as being unfounded, and the third ground of appeal must be rejected in its entirety as being, in part, inadmissible and, in part, unfounded.",conc,conclusion,conclusion
