"As regards the substance, the General Court held as follows in paragraphs 185 to 188 of the judgment under appeal: ‘185 With regard to the arguments raised in the fourth plea, it is clear that, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the Commission had to base its decision on the [TCF] and not directly apply Article 107(3)(b) TFEU in order to assess the compatibility of the payments made by ELGA in 2009 on account of the economic crisis experienced in Greece.",1,premise,premise
"Therefore, it is necessary to reject the arguments of the Hellenic Republic to the effect that, on account of the serious disturbance in the Greek economy due to the economic crisis experienced in Greece since the end of 2008 and in 2009, the Commission should have declared the payments made by ELGA in 2009 compatible directly on the basis of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU.’ Under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, ‘the following may be considered to be compatible with the internal market: … aid … to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State’.",1,premise,conclusion
"The second part of the third ground of appeal, relating to the obligation to state reasons – Arguments of the parties The Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court failed to respond to its argument that the decision at issue was excessive in that it also required the recovery of the compensation aid that constituted compensation for actual damage.",0,non-argumentative,premise
"In view of the fact that, during that period, the Greek economy had to face a series of budgetary measures aimed at stabilising the economy, such as the over-taxation of farmers, the introduction of exceptional and solidarity contributions, the dismantling of the welfare state, increased value added tax, higher heating oil prices, and cuts in wages and pensions, any ‘economic advantage’ that the farmers might have received from ELGA would automatically have been wiped out.",0,non-argumentative,premise
"In the context of that examination, the General Court stated, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, ‘that the fact that the payments made by ELGA in 2009 were intended to compensate for damage caused to agricultural production because of adverse weather conditions d[id] not preclude the existence of an advantage and the classification as State aid’ and, in paragraph 102 of that judgment, ‘that, according to settled case-law, competition is distorted where a measure mitigates the burden imposed on a beneficiary undertaking and thereby strengthens its position as regards competing undertakings’.",1,premise,premise
