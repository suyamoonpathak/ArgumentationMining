"The Commission found that: “... under Article 5(a) of Law … 1790/1988 ... and other provisions of Greek legislation in force, ELGA’s income from the special contribution was collected by the tax authorities, entered in the State budget as State revenue and paid to ELGA from the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture (now the Ministry of Rural Development and Food).",argumentative,argumentative
"In addition, it is settled case-law of the Court that distortion must be obvious from the documents in the Court’s file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (judgments in Lafarge v Commission, C-413/08 P, EU:C:2010:346, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, C-47/10 P, EU:C:2011:698, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).",argumentative,non-argumentative
"In the present case, the General Court found as follows in paragraphs 122 to 128 and 130 to 132 of the judgment under appeal: ‘122 The Commission recalled in the contested decision, that the Court had already held in the judgment in Freskot [(C-355/00, EU:C:2003:298)] that “the national legislation at issue clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law (see, in particular, France v Commission, [C-482/99, EU:C:2002:294], paragraph 24)” (recital 58).",argumentative,non-argumentative

"According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court, would in effect allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice a wider case than that heard by the General Court (see, to that effect, judgments in Alliance One International and Standard Commercial Tobacco v Commission and Commission v Alliance One International and Others, C-628/10 P and C-14/11 P, EU:C:2012:479, paragraph 111, and Groupe Gascogne v Commission, C-58/12 P, EU:C:2013:770, paragraph 35).",argumentative,argumentative
"Specifically, the General Court did not examine to what extent the decision at issue, in so far as it ordered the recovery of the contributions paid to farmers, was compatible with the provisions of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU and of Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [108 TFEU] (OJ 1999 L 83, p.",non-argumentative,argumentative
