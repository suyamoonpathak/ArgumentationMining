gives the following

Judgment

Facts and procedure

Background to the dispute

1

By letter of 11 January 1996 the Commission notified the Portuguese Government of its decision to raise no objection under Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now,
after amendment, Article 87 EC) and Article 93 of the EC Treaty (now Article 88
EC) with regard to, inter alia, State aid N11/95 granted by Portugal to DAI —
Sociedade de Desenvolvimento Agro-industrial SA ('DAI') for the establishment
of a beet sugar refining plant at Coruche in the Tagus and Sorraia valley
(hereinafter 'the decision of 11 January 1996', or 'the contested decision').

2

The investment project in question initially related to a maximum installed sugarproduction capacity of 60 000 tonnes per year, corresponding to the white sugar
quota allocated to mainland Portugal by Article 26 and Annex I, Chapter XIV(c),
of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the
Portuguese Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties ('the Act of Accession'),
which amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the
common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (OJ 1981 L 177, p. 4).
Under the Act of Accession, that quota is intended for undertakings established in
mainland Portugal which are 'likely to start up sugarproduction'. It was raised to
II - 1895

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

70 000 tonnes by Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/96 of 30 July 1996
amending Regulation No 1785/81 (OJ 1996 L 206, p. 43).

3

The procedure for examination by the Commission of the abovementioned aid in
favour of DAI was as follows: initially, the Portuguese authorities notified the aid
with a view to obtaining financial assistance from the Structural Funds. That
application for Community aid, submitted first to the European Regional
Development Fund (ERDF), was amended for subsequent submission to the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance
Section, since it had to be examined under the rules relating not to industry but to
the agricultural sector.

4

The cane sugar refineries Alcantara Refinarias — Açúcares SA and RAR
Refinarias de Açúcar Reunidas SA, which were then the only sugar producers
established in mainland Portugal, and the association of which those two
refineries were members, Associação dos Refinadores de Açúcar Portugueses
(ARAP), lodged complaints against the abovementioned aid intended for DAI.

5

Following those complaints, the Portuguese authorities subsequently also notified
that aid under Article 93(3) of the Treaty.

6

By letter of 19 March 1996 the Commission informed the three complainants of
its decision of 11 January 1996 not to raise any objection with regard to that aid
under Article 92 of the Treaty.
II - 1896

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

Legislative background

7

The abovementioned aid comes within the legal framework of the Community
policy on State aid and assistance from the Structural Funds in the agricultural
sector. According to the first paragraph of Article 42 of the EC Treaty (now the
first paragraph of Article 36 EC), the provisions of the Treaty relating to State aid
are to apply 'to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the
extent determined by the Council..., account being taken of the objectives [of the
common agricultural policy] set out in Article 39 of the EC Treaty'.

8

In that connection, Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 provides: 'Save as
otherwise provided in this Regulation, Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty shall apply
to the production of, and trade in, the products listed in Article 1(1)', which
include in particular beet sugar and cane sugar, and also sugar beet and sugar
cane. Under Article 45 of that regulation, it is to 'be applied so that appropriate
account is taken, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 33 and 110
of the Treaty'.

9

Also, with regard to co-financing by the Community of certain investments by
recourse to the Structural Funds with a view to strengthening economic and social
cohesion in accordance with Article 130a of the EC Treaty (now, after
amendment, Article 158 EC), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June
1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on
coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the
European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (OJ 1988
L 185, p. 9) entrusts the Structural Funds with, in particular, the tasks of
promoting the development and structural adjustment of the regions whose
development is lagging behind (Objective 1), speeding up the adjustment of
agricultural structures (Objective 5(a)) and promoting the development of rural
areas (Objective 5(b)). According to the Annex to that regulation, Portugal in its
entirety is regarded as a region covered by Objective 1. Council Regulation (EEC)
No 4256/88 of 19 December 1988 lays down provisions for implementing
Regulation No 2052/88 as regards the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance Section (OJ 1988 L 374, p. 25), and was
II - 1897

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2085/93 of 20 July 1993 (OJ 1993
L 193, p. 44).

10 Pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation No 4256/88 the Council laid down, by
Council Regulation (EEC) No 866/90 of 29 March 1990 on improving the
processing and marketing conditions for agricultural products (OJ 1990 L 91,
p. 1), last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 951/97 of 20 May 1997 on
improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural products
(OJ 1997 L 142, p. 22), the conditions and procedures for the contribution by the
Guidance Section of the EAGGF to measures for improving the processing and
marketing conditions for agricultural products with a view to attaining the
objectives laid down by Regulation No 2052/88. Article 1(1) of Regulation
No 866/90 introduces a common measure under Objective 5(a) of Regulation
No 2052/88, which is also designed to help to achieve Objectives 1 and 5(b) set
out in Article 1 of that regulation.

1 1 Article 2 of Regulation No 866/90 provides for the adoption by the Commission
of criteria for choosing investments eligible for Community financing, referred to
as 'selection criteria'. Article 8(1) provides that those selection criteria are to be
used to determine which investments are to receive assistance from the Fund,

laying down priorities and indicating those investments which must be excluded
from Community financing. Under Article 8(2), 'The selection criteria shall be
drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the Community's policies,
particularly the common agricultural policy'.

12 Pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation No 866/90, the Commission adopted
Decision 94/173/EC of 22 March 1994 on the selection criteria to be adopted for
investments for improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural and forestry products and repealing Decision 90/342/EEC of 7 June 1990
II - 1898

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

(OJ 1994 L 79, p. 29). According to the preamble to that decision 'the selection
criteria reflect the guidelines of the common agricultural policy' (seventh recital)
and their application should 'take account of the duly justified specific needs of
certain local productions' (fifth recital). The Annex to that decision, to which
Article 1 refers, excludes 'all investments concerning sugar..., with the exception
of those which provide for:

— utilisation of the quota provided for in the Act of Accession of Portugal (for
mainland Portugal, 60 000 tonnes of sugar)'.

1 3 In addition, under Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, 'Within the field of
application of this Regulation, Member States may take aid measures which are
subject to conditions or rules concerning granting which differ from those
provided for in this Regulation, or, where the amounts of aid exceed the ceilings
specified herein, on condition that such measures comply with Articles 92 to 94
of the EC Treaty'. When applying those provisions of the Treaty to State aid
measures, the Commission is to apply by analogy inter alia the limitations of a
sectoral nature relating to the co-financing of such investments by the
Community, in accordance with the Guidelines for State aid in connection with
investments in the processing and marketing of agricultural products, of
2 February 1996 (OJ 1996 C 29, p. 4). According to those guidelines, all State
aid relating to the investments referred to in point 1.2 of the Annex to Decision
94/173, or in point 2 thereof if the particular conditions laid down therein are not
fulfilled, is excluded.
II - 1899

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

The aid examined in the decision of 11 January 1996

14 The aid for DAI examined by the Commission in the decision of 11 January 1996
is of three kinds. A first grant of aid of PTE 1 275 290 000 takes the form of tax
reliefs granted under the general aid scheme introduced in Portugal by DecreeLaw 95/90 of 20 March 1990 amending the Estatuto dos Benefícios Fiscais (Tax
benefits measure) and introducing a scheme specifically for large-scale investment
projects. The scheme provides for special tax reliefs, limited to a period of 10
years, for companies making investments in excess of PTE 10 000 million. The
maximum aid available is 10% of the net investments made or, in exceptional
cases, 20%.

15 The scheme introduced by Decree-Law 95/90 was approved pursuant to
Article 92 of the Treaty by Commission decision of 3 July 1991 (SG (91) D/
13312) (hereinafter 'the decision of 3 July 1991' or 'the approval decision'),
notified to the Portuguese Government on 15 July 1991, subject to the condition
that the individual aid was in conformity with 'the rules and guidelines laid down
by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries
sectors'. The approval decision also requires the Portuguese Government to notify
'all projects enjoying reliefs of between 10 and 20% (ESL) and all those in
sensitive sectors'. That general aid scheme remained in force until 31 December
1995. By decision notified to the Portuguese Government on 30 May 1996 the
Commission approved extension of the scheme under the same conditions until
1999, but removed the obligation to give notice of projects in sensitive sectors,
which is no longer mentioned.

16 In its decision of 11 January 1996 the Commission noted that the tax reliefs in
favour of DAI did not exceed 10% of the investment and that its approval
decision made the grant of the aid concerned subject to the Community rules
applicable to the agricultural sector. After indicating that its examination of the
project concerned, in so far as it related to investments, involved verification of
compliance with the Community provisions on State aid in the agricultural sector,
II - 1900

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

it stated that the tax reliefs in question were not excluded by Decision 94/173,
which lays down the selection criteria for investments eligible for co-financing
under the Guidance Section of the EAGGE

17 A second grant of aid of PTE 380 000 000 for vocational training for staff at the
new refinery (at least 200 people) was regarded as compatible with the common
market. The decision of 11 January 1996 indicated in that regard that, 'according
to Commission practice, measures of this kind intended to impart new knowledge
are authorised for up to 100% of the eligible expenses'. In this case, the aid would
not exceed 68% of such expenses.

18 Finally, the Commission stated in the same decision that the third national aid
measure in question, the grant of PTE 1 912 335 000 (that is, 15% of the eligible
investments) by way of co-financing of investments eligible for Community aid in
the amount of PTE 6 372 065 000 (that is, 49.97% of the eligible investments)
under Regulation No 866/90, did not fall within the scope of Articles 92 and 93
of the Treaty and would be examined under that regulation.

Procedure and forms of order sought

19 By application received at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 29 May
1996 the applicants brought the present action.

20 By applications received at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 8 and
18 November 1996 respectively, the Portuguese Republic and DAI sought leave
to intervene in support of the defendant. The President of the Fifth Chamber,
Extended Composition, granted them leave to intervene by order of 18 March
1997. DAI and the Portuguese Republic submitted their statements in intervenII - 1901

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

tion on 19 and 24 June 1997 respectively. The Commission and the applicants
submitted their observations on those statements on 30 September and
1 December 1997 respectively.

21 Upon hearing the report of the Judge-Rapporteur, the Court of First Instance
decided to open the oral procedure without any preparatory inquiry. The parties
presented oral argument and answered questions put to them orally by the Court
at the hearing on 18 November 1998.

22

The applicants claim that the Court of First Instance should:

— declare their action admissible;

— annul the decisions of 11 January 1996 and 19 March 1996;

— order the Commission to pay the costs.

23

The defendant contends that the Court of First Instance should:

— reject as inadmissible the claim for annulment of the Commission's letter of
19 March 1996 and the claim for annulment of its decision of 11 January
II - 1902

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

1996 in so far as it concerns the aid granted in the form of tax reliefs, and
dismiss the action as unfounded in all other respects;

— alternatively, dismiss the application in its entirety as unfounded;

— order the applicants to pay the costs.

24

The Portuguese Republic, intervening in support of the Commission, contends
that the Court of First Instance should:

— dismiss the application as inadmissible;

— in the alternative, dismiss the application as unfounded.

25

DAI, intervening in support of the Commission, contends that the Court of First
Instance should:

— dismiss the application as inadmissible in so far as it seeks annulment of the
Commission's letter of 19 March 1996 and the decision of 11 January 1996
in so far as it concerns the aid granted in the form of tax reliefs;

— dismiss the remainder of the application as unfounded;

The claim for annulment of the 'decision' of 19 March 1996

Admissibility

1. Arguments of the parties

26

The Commission, supported by the Portuguese Republic and DAI, contends that
the claim for annulment of its letter of 19 March 1996 is inadmissible. That letter
merely informs the applicants of the decision of 11 January 1996 not to raise
objections under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to the planned aid for DAI.

27

The applicants consider that the action is admissible in its entirety. The letter of
19 march 1996 does not merely provide them with information but constitutes a
definitive rejection of their complaint and of their express request for initiation of
the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty (see, a contrario, Case T-154/94
CSF and CSME ν Commission [1996] ECR II-1377, paragraphs 49 and 50). It
has definitive legal effects as far as they are concerned and is therefore in the
nature of a decision (Joined Cases 166/86 and 220/86 Irish Cement ν
Commission [1988] ECR 6473, paragraph 11).
II - 1904

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

2. Findings of the Court

28

Decisions adopted by the Commission in relation to State aid are addressed to the
Member States concerned. That is also the case where such decisions concern
State measures to which objection is taken in complaints on the ground that they
constitute State aid contrary to the Treaty and the Commission refuses to initiate
the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty because it considers either that
the measures complained of do not constitute State aid within the meaning of
Article 92 of the EC Treaty or that they are compatible with the common market.
Where the Commission adopts such a decision and, in accordance with its duty of
sound administration, proceeds to inform the complainants thereof, it is the
decision addressed to the Member State which must form the subject-matter of
any action for annulment which the complainant may bring, and not the letter to
that complainant (Case C-3 67/95 P Commission v Sy travai and Brink's France
[1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 45).

29

In this case, the Commission confined itself, in its letter of 19 March 1996, to
informing the applicants, which had lodged complaints against the aid measures
at issue, of its decision of 11 January 1996, notified to the Portuguese
Government on the same date, not to raise objections to that aid under
Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.

30

That purely informative letter does not in any way constitute a decision and is not
therefore a measure against which proceedings may be instituted under
Article 173 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 230 EC). In this
case, protection of the applicants' rights is assured by the possibility — of which,
moreover, they have availed themselves in this action — of bringing proceedings
for annulment against the decision of 11 January 1996 addressed to the Member
State concerned.

31 In those circumstances, the claim for annulment of the letter of 11 March 1996
must be dismissed as inadmissible.
II - 1905

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

The claim for annulment of the decision of 11 January 1996

Admissibility

1. Arguments of the parties
32

The Commission, supported by the Portuguese Government and DAI, contends
that the application for annulment of the contested decision is partially
inadmissible, in so far as it relates to the aid granted in the form of tax reliefs,
since the applicants have no interest in bringing proceedings. It states that it was
empowered only to verify, in that decision, the conformity of the tax reliefs at
issue with its decision authorising the general aid scheme introduced by DecreeLaw 95/90. However, the applicants do not allege any lack of conformity and
have thus demonstrated no interest in having the contested decision annulled:
even if the decision were annulled, those tax reliefs, granted under a general aid
scheme approved by the decision of 3 July 1991, constitute existing aid which the
Portuguese authorities would still be entitled to grant. In that connection, for the
applicants to plead, as they purport to do in this case, that the approval decision
is illegal amounts to an abuse of procedure.

33

The Portuguese Government also rejects the view that the applicants are directly
and individually concerned by the contested decision within the meaning of the
fourth paragraph of Article 173 of the Treaty. The three types of aid at issue have
no repercussions on their position in the Portuguese sugar market.

34

The applicants, for their part, consider that Alcantara Refinarias — Açúcares SA
and RAR Refinarias de Açúcar Reunidas SA are directly and individually
concerned by the contested decision in so far as it affects them as competitors of
II - 1906

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

DAI which had lodged complaints about the aid granted to that company. The
same applies to ARAP, which represents the interests of the Portuguese cane sugar
industry and also lodged a complaint with the Commission.

2. Findings of the Court

35

The first objection of inadmissibility, alleging that the applicants have no interest
in bringing proceedings for annulment of the contested decision because even if it
were annulled the tax reliefs at issue, constituting as they do existing aid, would
be maintained, cannot be upheld.

36

The fact that an individual grant of aid forming part of a general aid scheme duly
approved by the Commission is regarded as existing aid whose payment has
already been authorised does not deprive the applicants of an interest in bringing
proceedings in this case. In particular, they have an interest in seeking annulment
of the contested decision in so far as the Commission does not raise objections to
the tax reliefs granted to DAI, precisely because that aid might not, in their view,
be covered by the approval decision — which makes the grant of individual aid
subject in particular to the rules and guidelines applicable to the relevant
agricultural sector — since they are incompatible with the rules of the common
agricultural policy. Indeed, were the Court of First Instance to annul the contested
decision on that ground, it would in principle be incumbent on the Commission
to require repayment of all the aid already granted to DAI. Similarly, if the
approval decision were held to be unlawful, it would be incumbent on the
defendant institution to treat the tax reliefs for DAI as new aid and to make a
direct examination of their conformity with the Treaty (Case C-47/91 Italy v
Commission [1994] ECR 1-4635, paragraph 26). In that regard, the question of
admissibility raised by the Commission regarding the objection that the approval
decision is illegal cannot be examined at this stage. It is linked with the substance
of the action for annulment and will be examined in relation thereto.
II - 1907

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

37

The applicants thus certainly have an interest in securing annulment of the
contested decision in so far as it relates to the tax reliefs.

38

In connection with the second objection of inadmissibility, the Portuguese
Government contends that the applicants are not directly and individually
concerned within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 173 of the
Treaty. Although that plea was not made by the defendant, since the conditions
for the admissibility of an application are mandatory the Court must examine
them of its own motion (Case T-465/93 Consorzio Gruppo di Azione Locale
‘Murgia Messapica' ν Commission [1994] ECR II-361, paragraph 24).

39

It must be borne in mind that according to settled case-law (see in particular Case
C-198/91 Cook ν Commission [1993] ECR I-2487, paragraphs 20 to 24, and
Commission ν Sytraval and Brink's France, cited above, paragraphs 47 and 48),
the right of competing undertakings to bring proceedings challenging a
Commission decision finding, on conclusion of the preliminary examination
procedure under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, that aid is compatible with the
common market is incontestable. Since the Treaty requires the Commission to
allow interested parties to submit their comments only in the preliminary
examination phase under Article 93(2) of the Treaty, the latter may secure

compliance with those procedural guarantees where the Commission decides not
to initiate the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty only if they are able to
challenge that decision before the Court.

40

In this case, the general tax relief scheme at issue had been approved by the
Commission without recourse to the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty.
Moreover, the contested decision was in any event the only means by which the
applicants could appraise the extent to which their interests are affected. The
applicants cannot therefore secure compliance with the procedural guarantees
II - 1908

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

afforded them by Article 93(2) of the Treaty as interested third parties unless they
have an opportunity to challenge that decision before the Court.

41 The Commission's objection of inadmissibility must therefore be rejected.

Substance

42

In order to challenge the contested decision the applicants rely on separate pleas
for each of the three types of aid granted.

A — The tax reliefs

43

In support of their claim for annulment of the contested decision on the ground
that it raises no objections to the aid granted in the form of tax reliefs, the
applicants put forward three pleas in law. First, they allege that the decision of
3 July 1991 is illegal under Article 184 of the EC Treaty (now Article 241 EC).
Second, those tax reliefs in any event represent new aid which the Portuguese
II - 1909

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

Government was required to notify on the basis of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.
Third, that aid is contrary to the common agricultural policy.

The first plea: illegality of the decision of 3 July 1991

Admissibility of the objection of illegality

— Arguments of the parties

44

According to the Commission, supported by the Portuguese Government and
DAI, the applicants' objection that the decision of 3 July 1991 is illegal is
inadmissible. That decision constitutes the legal basis not of the contested
decision but of the national implementing measures adopted for the grant of the
tax reliefs at issue. The applicants should have brought an action to challenge
those measures before the national court, relying on Article 184 of the Treaty, in
order to preclude implementation of the decision of 3 July 1991.

45

The applicants submit that their objection, to the effect that the approval decision
on which the contested decision was, in their view, based is inapplicable, is
admissible under Article 184 of the Treaty.
II - 1910

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

— Findings of the Court

46

It is settled case-law that the right under Article 184 of the Treaty to raise an
objection of illegality 'gives expression to the general principle conferring on any
party to proceedings the right to challenge, for the purpose of obtaining the
annulment of a decision of direct and individual concern to that party, the
validity of previous acts of the institutions which form the legal basis of the
decision which is being attacked, if that party was not entitled under Article 173
of the Treaty to bring a direct action challenging those acts by which it was thus
affected without having been in a position to ask that they be declared void' (Case
92/78 Simmenthal v Commission [1979] ECR 777, paragraph 39).

47

The general principle thus expounded by the Court applies equally in
circumstances in which an individual decision is directly based on a measure of
general scope which may be the subject of an action for annulment by natural or
legal persons with standing to institute proceedings against such a measure, in
particular where only the individual decision enables them to determine precisely
to what extent their particular interests are affected (see in particular Joined
Cases 44/74, 46/74 and 49/74 Acton and Others v Commission [1975] ECR 383,
paragraph 7, Case 164/87 Simonella v Commission [1988] ECR 3807, paragraph
16, and Case T-60/92 Noonan v Commission [1993] ECR 11-911, paragraph 23).

48

In this case, contrary to the Commission's contention, there is a direct legal link
between the decision of 3 July 1991 and the contested decision in so far as the
latter is based, as regards the tax reliefs, on the decision of 3 July 1991 approving
the general scheme of tax reliefs. The individual grants of aid, regarded as
existing aid, can only be checked by the Commission in the light of the conditions
which it set out in the decision approving the general scheme (Italy v
II- 1911

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

Commission, cited above, paragraph 24, and Case C-278/95 Ρ Siemens ν
Commission [1997] ECR I-2507, paragraph 31).

49

In those circumstances — regardless of whether the applicants could have been
recognised as having standing to contest the decision of 3 July 1991 — effective
judicial protection of their rights is in any event assured only if they have an
opportunity to raise an objection alleging the irregularity of that decision in
proceedings challenging the Commission decision relating to the individual aid,
which alone allows them to determine precisely the extent to which their
individual interests are affected.

50

It follows that the objection of inadmissibility raised against the plea alleging that
the approval decision is unlawful must in any event be rejected.

The merits of the objection of illegality

51 The first plea, alleging that the decision of 3 July 1991 is illegal, comprises three
parts. First, the Commission failed to take account of the sectoral consequences
of the general aid scheme when adopting the approval decision, which is
incompatible with the common agricultural policy. Second, the procedure for the
adoption of that approval decision lacked transparency in that the Commission
II - 1912

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

did not initiate the procedure provided for by Article 93(2) of the Treaty. Third,
that procedure was defective.

(a) The alleged failure to verify the sectoral consequences of the general aid
scheme at issue

Arguments of the parties

52

The applicants observe that the exceptions provided for in Article 92(3)(a) and
(c) of the Treaty must be interpreted restrictively. In particular, in sensitive
sectors, such as agriculture or those in which there is excess capacity, the
Commission is under a duty when approving general aid schemes to impose on
the Member States concerned appropriate conditions making it possible,
whenever those schemes are applied in a specific instance, to verify in particular
that the sectoral consequences of the planned aid are not contrary to the common
interest (Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR1-135, paragraph 20). It
follows that a general scheme of national aid cannot be approved without the
express condition being imposed that any application of it to the agricultural
sector must in all cases be preceded by notification of it to the Commission under
Article 93(3) of the Treaty.

53

In this case the applicants consider the decision of 3 July 1991 to be incompatible
with the common agricultural policy in so far as it does not impose an obligation
to notify the individual aids, whereas the Community rules governing the sugar
sector do not in their view allow State aid to be granted to Portuguese beet sugar
II - 1913

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

producers. The condition concerning compliance with the Community rules laid
down in the approval decision is too imprecise in that respect.

54

For its part, the Commission submits that, in the approval decision, it imposed
the kind of condition called for by the applicants as a safeguard against the
sectoral consequences of the general aid scheme: it was unnecessary to define all
those conditions precisely in the decision itself since they are set out in detail in
the Community rules governing the agricultural sector. The approval decision
makes application of the general aid scheme in question subject to compliance
with those rules, as is expressly stated in the contested decision.

Findings of the Court

55

In this case, the applicants have not demonstrated that compliance with the rules
applicable to the sugar sector was not ensured by the conditions laid down in the
approval decision. In fact, the Commission's decision expressly made the grant of
individual tax reliefs subject to observance of the Community rules relating in
particular to the agricultural sectors. The applicants have not produced in that
regard any specific evidence to support the view that that condition is not
sufficient to exclude from the authorised general scheme aid which is
incompatible with the common agricultural policy. Moreover, they do not
mention any rule relating to the common organisation of the sugar markets which
required the imposition, at the time of approval of the general aid scheme in
question, of an obligation to notify individual grants of aids in the sugar sector.

56

Furthermore, the aid granted in the sugar sector under the general scheme of tax
reliefs at issue does not thereby escape Commission control. Although it is
incumbent primarily on the Member State concerned, when planning granting a
tax relief under the general aid scheme approved by the Commission, to ensure
compliance with the Community rules, the fact remains that the Commission may
II - 1914

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

at any time verify the compatibility of such individual aid with the approval
decision and in particular with the rules applicable to the agricultural sector
concerned. In the interests of sound administration of the fundamental rules of
the Treaty relating to State aid, it is incumbent on the Commission to undertake
such a verification in particular where, as in this case, it has received a complaint
against such aid.

57

On all those grounds, the first part of the first plea, alleging failure to examine the
sectoral consequences of the general aid scheme at issue, cannot be upheld.

(b) The alleged lack of transparency in the procedure for approval of the general
aid scheme

Arguments of the parties

58

The applicants criticise the Commission for not making public the notification of
Decree-Law 95/90 and its approval decision until after the event. The legitimate
interests of third parties in a sensitive sector like that of sugar were thus not
respected, in so far as the Commission approved the general aid scheme under
Article 93(3) of the Treaty without initiating the procedure under paragraph 2 of
that article, which alone upholds the right of interested parties to be heard and
provides for an analysis of the market to evaluate the potential effects of the aid
in question.

59

The Commission rejects that argument, contending that the obligation to initiate
the procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty depends on the difficulty of
II - 1915

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

appraising the compatibility of the aid scheme in question and not, as submitted
by the applicants, the importance of the sector concerned.

60 DAI supports that argument. It adds that no rule states, for the protection of
third-party interests, at precisely what moment the notification of State aid under
Article 93(3) of the Treaty must be published by the Commission.

Findings of the Court

61 The lack of any publicity concerning the notification by the Member State
concerned and the Commission's examination of a grant of aid under
Article 93(3) of the Treaty, together with its decision not to initiate the procedure
under Article 93(2) of the Treaty involving third parties, cannot be assimilated to
a lack of transparency in the system for examining State aid established by
Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty. It is true that the summary examination of State
aid forming part of the preliminary stage under Article 93(3) of the Treaty does
not enable the Commission to take account of the interests of third parties.
However, the procedure incorporates sufficient guarantees and is therefore fully
justified by the need to avoid delay where it is clear that the measure notified by
the Member State concerned or complained about by a third party does not
constitute State aid or constitutes aid compatible with the common market. The
rights of third parties are protected by the possibility of their instituting
proceedings, if appropriate, against the Commission's decision not to initiate the
procedure under Article 93(2) of the Treaty (Cook ν Commission, cited above,
paragraphs 22 to 24, and Case C-225/91 Matra ν Commission [1993] ECR
I-3203, paragraphs 16 to 18).

62 In this case, the legitimate interests of the applicants are in any event protected in
particular by the right, of which they have availed themselves in the present
II - 1916

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

action challenging the decision of 11 January 1996, to claim, in relation to the
tax reliefs granted to DAI, that the approval decision is inoperative by virtue of
Article 184 of the Treaty (see paragraphs 43 to 50 above).

63

In those circumstances, there is no basis for the allegation of failure to observe the
rights of third parties in the procedure for the adoption of the decision of 3 July
1991. The second part of the first plea, alleging lack of transparency in that
procedure, cannot therefore be upheld.

(c) The alleged impropriety of the internal procedure for the adoption of the
decision of 3 July 1991

Arguments of the parties

64

The applicants query the conformity with the Commission's Rules of Procedure
of the procedure for the adoption of the decision of 3 July 1991. In order to verify
whether the authentic version of the abovementioned decision, in the Portuguese
language, was in fact placed before the College of the Members of the
Commission for adoption and authentication, it is necessary to compare the
text of document SEC (91) 1266, mentioned in the minutes of the Commission
meeting of 3 July 1991, with the letter of 15 July 1991, mentioned above,
addressed to the Portuguese Government.

65

According to the Commission, the minutes of its meeting of 3 July 1991 show
that the approval decision was adopted by the Members of the Commission and
II - 1917

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

was duly authenticated by the President and the Secretary General, as required by
its Rules of Procedure.

Findings of the Court

66

The applicants have not produced any significant evidence capable of raising
serious doubts as to the legality of the procedure for adoption of the approval
decision. On the contrary, it is clear from the minutes of the Commission's
meeting of 3 July 1991, produced by the Commission, that the approval decision
was in fact adopted by the Members of the Commission and authenticated by the
President and the Secretariat General.

67

In that context, having regard to the presumption of validity attaching to
Community acts and in the absence of the slightest evidence produced by the
applicants that the procedure for the adoption of the approval decision was
irregular, the third part of the first plea must be rejected, and it is unnecessary to
accede to the applicants' request that a comparison of the documents be made
(see Case T-9/89 Hüls ν Commission [1992] ECR 11-499, paragraph 384, and
Case T-156/94 Siderùrgica Aristrain Madrid ν Commission [1999] ECR II-645,
paragraph 217).

68

It follows that the first plea must be rejected.
II - 1918

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

The second plea: breach of the alleged obligation to examine the individual
grants of aid to DAI

Arguments of the parties

69

The applicants criticise the Commission for declining in this case to examine the
tax reliefs for DAI in the light of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty. The Court of
Justice did not hold, in Italy v Commission, cited above, that the specific
measures implementing a general aid scheme do not have to be notified to the
Commission or that it is not necessary to examine them individually once the

general scheme has been approved. The requirement of notification is lifted only
where 'the factors to be taken into consideration by the Commission in assessing
[the implementing measures] are the same as those which it applied on examining
the general scheme' (paragraph 21 of the judgment). The Member States are
therefore required to notify grants of aid envisaged in pursuance of such a general
aid scheme if they do not constitute a straightforward or foreseeable application
of that scheme and to the extent that the grants of aid need to be appraised in the
light of factors other than the general scheme itself, in particular where they are
liable to exacerbate existing defects in the market, such as surplus capacity. In this
case, the approval of Decree-Law 95/90 does not authorise Portugal to apply it in
the sugar sector where the aid affects the delicate balance which the common
agricultural policy endeavours to establish.

70

The Commission contests that interpretation of the judgment in Italy v
Commission. The distinction drawn by the applicants would lead to considerable
legal uncertainty.

71 The interveners endorse that view. DAI also states that the applicants' thesis
disregards the underlying logic of the approval of a general aid scheme by the
Commission. Such approval is intended to reconcile coherent monitoring of State
aid — which must not exceed the limits set by the general scheme or infringe
specific rules of Community law — with the need to relieve the Commission of
II - 1919

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

some of its administrative burdens, whilst offering undertakings the requisite
legal certainty.

Findings of the Court

72

In Italy ν Commission the Court of Justice held that once a general aid scheme
has been approved by the Commission, the individual implementing measures do
not need to be notified to it unless reservations to that effect were expressed in the
approval decision. Indeed, direct examination of each individual aid in the light
of Article 92 of the Treaty would enable the Commission to go back on its
approval decision and would be contrary to the principles of protection of
legitimate expectations and legal certainty.

73

The distinction contended for by the applicants is incompatible with the
abovementioned principles. An individual aid granted in implementation of a

general aid scheme cannot in principle be regarded as an unforeseeable
application of that scheme. In the first place, it would be contrary to the
principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty to require
notification of individual measures with a view to their being re-examined by the
Commission under Article 92 of the Treaty on the basis of factors which it had
already taken into account when approving the general scheme. Secondly, if the
situation changes after the general aid scheme concerned has been approved, that
fact will be taken into consideration by the Commission, in compliance, of
course, with the principle of legal certainty, as part of its constant monitoring of
existing aid schemes under Article 93(1) of the Treaty (see for example Case
C-44/93 Namur-Les Assurances du Crédit v OND [1994] ECR 1-3829,
paragraph 34). As regards the circumstances relied on by the applicant relating
to the particular situation of certain agricultural sectors, with, for example,
surplus production, it must be borne in mind that the Commission's approval of a
II - 1920

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

general aid scheme does not in any circumstances remove the individual aid
measures adopted under that scheme from the scope of all the specific rules
governing the sector concerned. As has already been held (see paragraphs 55 and
56), compliance with those rules is not subject in this case to the requirement of
prior notification of the planned individual measures.

74

In this case, if, when examining the general aid scheme established by DecreeLaw 95/90, the Commission had considered that the grant of such aid in certain
specific sectors necessitated a direct examination under Article 92 of the Treaty, it
would have been able and obliged to impose the requirement, in the approval
decision, that individual grants of aid in that sector be notified. However, the
decision of 3 July 1991 imposes no obligation to notify individual grants of aid in
the sugar sector. It only makes the authorisation of the tax reliefs at issue subject
to two precise conditions: the tax reliefs must not exceed 10% of the investments
made and must be compatible with the Community provisions applicable to the
agricultural sector concerned. It follows that the Commission was not entitled to
examine the tax reliefs granted to DAI directly in relation to Article 92 of the
Treaty provided that they were in conformity with the two abovementioned
conditions, as it found them to be in the contested decision.

75

It follows that the second plea in law must be rejected.

The third plea: incompatibility of the tax reliefs at issue with the common
agricultural policy

Arguments of the parties

76

According to the applicants, the implementation of the common agricultural
policy takes precedence over the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty
II - 1921

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

and Article 94 of the EC Treaty (now Article 89 EC) and over action undertaken
in the context of the Structural Funds. The Court of Justice upheld that primacy
of the objectives of the common agricultural policy over the Treaty rules on State
aid in its judgment in Case C-311/94 Ijssel Vliet ν Minister van Economische
Zaken [1996] ECR 1-5023, paragraphs 31 to 33.

77

In this case, any aid for the setting up of a beet sugar refinery is contrary to the
objectives of the common agricultural policy in the sugar sector. No exception
under Article 92(3) of the Treaty can therefore be applied to it.

78

The allocation of a sugar quota to mainland Portugal by the Treaty of Accession
does not justify support for the setting up of a beet sugar refinery in that country
using State aid and/or Community co-financing. The applicants maintain, relying
on Article 184 of the Treaty, that the abovementioned Decision 94/173 is illegal
in that it does not exclude the possibility of such support and cannot be used as a
valid legal basis for the contested decision. No principle or rule of Community
law legitimises the part of Decision 94/173 which provides that investments
relating to the production or refining of beet sugar in mainland Portugal,
intended to make use of the quota of 60 000 tonnes of white sugar allocated by
the Act of Accession, may benefit from Community co-financing.

79

Such support has adverse effects on the conditions prevailing in the sugar markets
and on the situation of third parties, namely producers of beet sugar in the other
Member States or Portuguese refiners of cane sugar. The production of beet sugar
in Portugal would lead to a surplus of 83 000 tonnes over consumption in that
country which, contrary to the Commission's contentions, is not in deficit as
regards sugar. It would thus considerably increase the EAGGF's financial burden
by leading to intervention purchases of 60 000 tonnes of beet sugar and export
refunds for cane sugar from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, refined and
sold by the applicant companies on the world market. Moreover, it would
II - 1922

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

aggravate structural over-production in the Community, where surplus sugar
production exceeded 5 300 000 tonnes in the year 1995 to 1996. Finally, the beet
sugar industry set up in Portugal using the aid at issue might prove not to be
viable. Portugal has also obtained an increase of its annual quota from 60 000 to
70 000 tonnes in order to ensure the viability of the beet sugar refinery under
construction.

80 The Commission states in reply that a sugar quota of 60 000 tonnes was allocated
to mainland Portugal in the Act of Accession to enable farmers in a region
offering few alternatives in terms of agricultural production to grow sugar beet.
As mainland Portugal did not at that time have any sugar production capable of
serving as a reference, the quota of 60 000 tonnes of white sugar was regarded as
the minimum necessary to allow profitable operation of a sugar refinery using
sugar beet grown in the region. There was never any doubt as to the need for
regional processing facilities to be installed owing to the substantial costs of
transporting sugar beet as compared with production costs. Moreover, in the
context of the common organisation of the sugar market, the quotas allocated to
the Member States are intended for the sugar-producing undertakings established
within their territory. Owing to the delay in setting up a refinery in Portugal, a
transitional measure authorised a sugar plant in Spain to refine sugar beet
harvested in Portugal, the sugar produced being 'considered as having been
produced by the Portuguese undertaking in question' (Article 24(la) of
Regulation No 1785/81, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1107/88
of 25 April 1988 (OJ1988 L110, p. 20). That measure made it possible to
commence beet sugar production in Portugal in 1986 but only on a small scale. It
was in order to give the necessary impetus to the construction of a profitable
sugar beet refinery in that country, and thereby encourage Portuguese farmers to
embark on beet sugar production, that the sugar quota allocated to mainland
Portugal was raised to 70 000 tonnes by the abovementioned Regulation
No 1599/96 of 30 July 1996 (see the proposal for a Council Regulation
amending Regulation No 1785/81 (OJ 1996 C 28, p. 6)).

81 The Portuguese Government states that Portugal's inability to use the sugar quota
allocated to it by the Act of Accession owing to the inadequacy of its agricultural
structures in the beet sugar sector renders the Treaty of Accession ineffective in
II - 1923

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

that regard and deprives the Portuguese economy of the benefit of the advantages
inherent in the market policy to which that economy contributes by bearing a
share of the Community charges, in particular through the Guarantee Section of
the EAGGF. That situation, which is inequitable, is even more anomalous because
Portugal is treated in its entirety by Regulation No 2052/88 as a target region for
the economic and social cohesion policy.

82

DAI supports that argument. It contends that the applicants have provided no
evidence to show that the beet sugar industry which is to utilise the quota
allocated to Portugal is not viable, would need fresh aid and would increase the
financial burden of the EAGGF.

83

Furthermore, in pursuing the various aims laid down in Article 39 of the Treaty,
the Community institutions may consider it appropriate to allow one or other of
them temporary priority in order to satisfy the economic conditions in view of
which their decisions are made (Joined Cases 279/84, 280/84, 285/84 and 286/84
Rau and Others ν Commission [1987] ECR 1069, paragraph 21).

Findings of the Court

84

In the contested decision, the Commission had the power and the duty to examine
only the propriety of the tax reliefs granted in this case to DAI having regard to
the conditions it imposed in its approval decision and, in particular, to the rules
applicable to the sugar sector.

85

In this case, the applicants allege that the tax reliefs granted to DAI are
incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy in the sugar sector.
II - 1924

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

Essentially, the creation of a beet sugar production industry in Portugal would
aggravate Community over-capacity in that sector and would give rise to
considerable costs for the intervention scheme.

86

It must be borne in mind at the outset that a common market organisation
pursues a set of distinct aims, reflecting the various objectives of the common
agricultural policy, as defined by Article 39(1) of the Treaty. It seeks in particular
to ensure optimum employment of farmers and ensure a fair standard of living for
them, to stabilise markets and to assure the availability of supplies to consumers
at reasonable prices. Moreover, Article 39(2) of the Treaty provides that, in
working out the common agricultural policy, account is to be taken of the
particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of
agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various
agricultural regions, the need to effect the appropriate adjustments by degrees
and the fact that in the Member States agriculture constitutes a sector closely
linked with the economy as a whole.

87

Furthermore, as DAI emphasised, the Community institutions have a permanent
duty to reconcile any conflict between those individual aims. For the purposes of
that duty to reconcile, they may allow one of them temporary priority in order to
satisfy the demands of the economic or other conditions in view of which their
decisions are made {Rau v Commission, cited above, paragraph 21).

88

In this case, it is necessary to verify whether the tax reliefs at issue, which are
intended to facilitate the development of certain economic regions in accordance
with Article 92(3)(c) of the EC Treaty, are compatible with the aims pursued by
the rules applicable to the sugar production and processing sector.
II - 1925

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

89

An analysis of those rules shows that the tax reliefs in favour of DAI, intended to
promote the setting up of a beet sugar refinery in mainland Portugal, conform
with the aims pursued and the rules laid down, in connection with the common
agricultural policy, by Regulation No 1785/81. It is precisely that regulation
which sets, in Article 24(2) as amended by the Treaty of Accession, a quota of 60
000 tonnes — later raised to 70 000 tonnes — for mainland Portugal, after
specifying in Article 24(1) that Portugal will allocate part of that quota 'to each
undertaking situated in that region which is likely to start up sugar production'.
Moreover, Article 44 clearly allows State aid for, among other things, the
production of beet sugar to be authorised under Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty.

90

Moreover, the tax reliefs at issue are compatible with the Community policy on
public intervention in favour of structural actions in the field of agriculture. In
that connection, Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90 provides expressly that
Member States may, in addition to the measures specifically provided for in that
regulation, grant aid for processing and marketing agricultural products under
the conditions laid down in Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty. In addition, the aid for
setting up a sugar refinery at issue in this case also conforms with the criteria for
selecting investments eligible for financial support from the Guidance Section of
the EAGGF. Decision 94/173, which lays down those criteria, expressly excludes
in point 2.8 of the Annex all investments in the sugar sector except those intended
to allow use of the quota provided for by the Act of Accession of Portugal.
Contrary to the applicants' claims (see paragraph 77 above), that exception
provided for by Decision 94/173 is accounted for by the allocation, by Regulation
No 1785/81, of a quota for mainland Portugal specifically in order to enable
undertakings established there to 'start up sugar production'. The aid at issue in
this case thus conforms with the sectoral limitations relating to the co-financing
of investments in the sugar processing and marketing sector, which are applicable
by analogy to State aid for investments in that sector, in accordance with the
Guidelines for State aid in connection with investments in the processing and
marketing of agricultural products, dated 2 February 1996, mentioned above
(paragraph 13).
II - 1926

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

91 In that context, the applicants' arguments concerning aggravation of the overproduction of sugar in the Community and an increase in the charges borne by
the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, are not such as to call in question the
compatibility of aid for the setting up of a beet sugar refinery in Portugal with the
common agricultural policy in the sugar sector. Since, as held in the foregoing
paragraphs, that aid is designed to permit use of the quota of 70 000 tonnes of
sugar expressly allocated to mainland Portugal so that the undertakings can 'start
up' production there, by Regulation No 1785/81 which established a common
market organisation in that sector, it cannot be denied that it contributes to
attainment of the aims pursued in the context of the common agricultural policy.
Moreover, the 70 000 tonne production capacity of the new beet sugar refinery to
be set up in Portugal could in any event lead only to a relatively small increase in
the sugar surplus in the Community, which attained some 5 300 000 tonnes in the
year 1995 to 1996 according to the figures cited by the applicants.

92

Finally, the file contains no persuasive evidence casting doubt on the viability of
the beet sugar refinery receiving the aid at issue. In that regard the applicants
merely refer in very general terms to the absence of outlets and uncertainties in
price developments and express doubts as to the success of sugar-beet growing in
mainland Portugal owing to climatic conditions and Portuguese farmers' lack of
experience in that field. They have produced no precise and concrete evidence in
support of those assertions.

93

It follows from all those considerations that the applicants have not shown that
the tax reliefs granted to DAI are incompatible with the aims of the common
agricultural policy, as implemented by the relevant rules.

94

The third plea cannot therefore be upheld.
II - 1927

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

95

It follows that the claim for annulment of the contested decision, in so far as it is
concerned with aid granted in the form of tax reliefs, must be rejected as
unfounded.

Β — Aid for vocational training

Arguments of the parties

96

The applicants rely on the sole plea of infringement of Article 92(3)(c) of the
Treaty. The aid for vocational training at issue is caught by the prohibition in
Article 92(1) of the Treaty and cannot qualify for the exception provided for in
Article 92(3)(c) owing to the adverse consequences of all the State aid in favour of
DAI on competition and the common agricultural policy. Those consequences,
which adversely affect the interests of the Community and of third parties, should
be appraised in relation to all the support granted, which amounts to 61.65% of
the total investment, according to the figures supplied by the Commission.

97

The Commission is of the opinion that each type of aid must be appraised
individually. In this case, the aid for vocational training is intended to finance
about 68% of the cost of the vocational training given to DAI staff and fulfils the
conditions laid down by Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty. In the agricultural sector,
the Commission systematically authorises aid of that kind fostering employment,
representing up to 100% of the expenditure, owing to the particular features of
that sector and the diversity of the systems of vocational training in the various
Member States, the costs borne by the employer in one country being funded by
the State in another.
II - 1928

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

Findings of the Court

98

The three types of aid examined in the contested decision, namely the tax reliefs,
aid for vocational training and investment aid under Regulation No 866/90, are
covered by different sets of legal provisions and must therefore be examined
individually in the light of those rules and the aims which they pursue, subject, if
appropriate, to verification of their compatibility with the specific rules
applicable in the sugar processing and marketing sector. The aid for vocational
training must therefore be considered separately in the light of Article 92(3)(c) of
the Treaty.

99

In that connection, it is settled case-law that, as regards the application of
Article 92 of the Treaty, the Commission enjoys a wide discretion, the exercise of
which involves assessments of an economic and social nature which must be
made within a Community context. In its review of legality, the Court must
therefore restrict itself to determining whether the Commission has exceeded the
scope of its discretion by a manifest error of assessment or by misuse of powers
{Matra v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 24 and 25).

100 In this case it should be noted that the purpose of the aid for vocational training
at issue was to facilitate the creation of a new beet sugar refining industry in
mainland Portugal with a view to fostering the activity of farmers in a region
offering few alternatives in terms of agricultural production. In that context, the
applicants have put forward no argument sufficient to call into question the
notion that the vocational training aid at issue will contribute to the development
of certain economic activities without adversely affecting trading conditions to an
extent contrary to the common interest.

101 It follows that the claim for annulment of the contested decision to the extent to
which it relates to vocational training aid must be rejected as unfounded.
II - 1929

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

C — Investment aid under Regulation No 866/90

102 The applicants put forward two pleas in law in support of the claim for
annulment of the contested decision in so far as it relates to investment aid under
Regulation No 866/90. First, they submit that grants of State aid fulfilling the
conditions laid down by that regulation to qualify for Community co-financing
are nevertheless subject to the application of Articles 92 and 93 the Treaty.
Second, they claim that Regulation No 866/90 excludes co-financing of the aid at
issue in this case.

The first plea: infringement of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty

Arguments of the parties

103 The applicants maintain that, in the sugar sector, only aid permitted under
Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty is eligible for Community co-financing under
Regulation No 866/90.

104 In implementation of Article 42 of the Treaty, Article 44 of Regulation
No 1785/81 provides that Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty are to apply to
production and marketing of the products listed in Article 1(1) of that regulation,
which include in particular beet sugar and cane sugar. As those provisions of the
Treaty were made applicable to a specific agricultural product, it would be
contrary to the objectives of Article 3 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment,
Article 3 EC) not to apply them to that sector, having regard to economic or
Community policy developments, on the basis of Article 42 of the Treaty.

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

105 In any event, Regulation No 866/90 does not specifically repeal the abovementioned provisions of Regulation No 1785/81. In those circumstances, in so
far as that regulation is of general scope, Article 16(5) thereof cannot be
interpreted as excluding the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to
State aid eligible for co-financing under Regulation No 866/90, since that would
render the Treaty provisions ineffective in the entire agricultural sector.
Article 16(5) merely confirms the clear applicability of the general rules laid
down by Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to aid measures not fulfilling the
conditions for Community co-financing.

106 Similarly, the applicants dispute the distinction drawn by the Commission
between aid directly linked with sugar production falling within the scope of
Regulation No 1785/81 and structural measures in the field of sugar processing
and marketing, which should be assessed only on the basis of Regulation
No 866/90. According to the applicants, Regulation No 1785/81 provides fair
guarantees both for processors (beet or cane sugar refiners) and for producers. All
the measures adopted in the beet sugar processing sector are thus covered solely
by the exhaustive rules laid down by that regulation.

107 According to the Commission, the aid at issue is not directly linked with the
production of sugar beet. It is not therefore covered by the rules on the common
organisation of the market in sugar set up by Regulation No 1785/81. It
constitutes structural aid intended to facilitate investments to promote processing
and marketing of beet sugar and as a result should be appraised solely in relation
to Regulation No 866/90 and the selection criteria set out in Decision 94/173.

108 It is apparent from Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90 that Articles 92 to 94
of the Treaty apply only if the aid measures depart from the conditions or detailed
arrangements laid down in that regulation or if the amount of the aid exceeds the
ceilings which it lays down.

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

109 The Portuguese Government maintains that the involvement of the Member State
concerned in structural action benefiting from the support of the Guidance
Section of the EAGGF constitutes Community aid and not State aid within the
meaning of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty. It does not therefore come within the
scope of those provisions of Regulation No 1785/81 which provide for the
applicability of the provisions on State aid.

110DAI contends that Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90 is based on Article 42
of the Treaty and excludes the application of Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty to
State aid for investments eligible for Community co-financing.

Findings of the Court

1 1 1The argument on which the applicants rely essentially to show that the
Commission should, in the contested decision, have checked whether the
investment aid in question might qualify for exception under Article 92(3) of
the Treaty is based on Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81, which provides, on
the basis of Article 42 of the Treaty, that Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty apply to
production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by
the Council.

112 Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 makes aid measures linked to the
functioning of the common organisation of the market in sugar subject to the
application of Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty but does not include in such
measures actions of a structural nature conducted under the auspices of the
Guidance Section of the EAGGF, which do not fall within the scope of Regulation
No 1785/81 but within that of Regulation No 866/90. The latter regulation, like
Regulation No 1785/81, is based on Article 42 of the Treaty, referred to above,
and Article 43 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 37 EC), relating
to the drawing up and implementation of the common agricultural policy, lays
down the provisions applicable to State aid in its field of application.
II - 1932

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

113 In particular, Regulation No 866/90 does not exclude the possibility of Member
States granting, regardless of any Community contribution, certain national
investment aid which comes within its field of application. It makes expressly
subject to Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty the grant of such aid, which is not
eligible for Community co-financing since it does not meet either the criteria
which that regulation defines, or those referred to by Decision 94/173.

1 1 4 In that context, in the absence of any similar provision in Regulation No 866/90
expressly providing for the application of Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty to aid
eligible for Community co-financing under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF,
such aid must be assessed in the specific context of the common action
undertaken in accordance with that regulation and cannot be the subject of
examination under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.

115Moreover, even if Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 could be interpreted as
specifically providing for the application of Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty to
every aid measure concerning sugar production and marketing, it must, in any
event, be applied having regard to the aims of the common agricultural policy,
whose precedence over the application of the Treaty provisions relating to
competition is enshrined in the Treaty itself, in Article 42 (see Ijssel Vliet, cited
above, paragraphs 31 to 33).

116 The application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to aid eligible for Community
co-financing in the context of Regulation No 866/90 would be liable to frustrate
the pursuit of certain aims of the common agricultural policy by means of specific
structural action undertaken in conformity with the criteria laid down in Decision
94/173, which establishes priorities for co-financing of investments covered by
that regulation.
II - 1933

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

117 In that regard, Regulation No 866/90 itself ensures the consistency of investment
aid, co-financed by the Community and the Member State concerned pursuant to
that regulation, with the common agricultural policy, in particular in the specific
sector of sugar, by providing for the adoption of selection criteria (fifth recital and
Article 8) and the establishment of sectoral plans (Articles 2 and 7) intended inter
alia to guarantee such consistency. In this case, the selection criteria defined by
Decision 94/173 pursuant to Article 8(3) of Regulation No 866/90 exclude all
investments in the sugar sector with the exception, in particular, of those which
provide for use of the quota allocated to mainland Portugal by Regulation
No 1785/81, as amended by the Act of Accession.

118It follows that the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to investment
aid eligible for Community co-financing under Regulation No 866/90 would be
incompatible with the precedence over the rules on competition accorded by the
Treaty to the common agricultural policy.

119 On all those grounds, aid eligible for Community co-financing under Regulation
No 866/90 is not subject to the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.

120 The first plea, alleging infringement of those articles, cannot therefore be upheld.
II - 1934

ARAP AND OTHERS V COMMISSION

The second plea: incompatibility of the aid at issue with Regulation No 866/90

Arguments of the parties

121 In support of their second plea, which they put forward in the alternative, the
applicants maintain that co-financing aid for the Portuguese beet sugar sector is
incompatible with the requirement that Community action be consistent with the
common agricultural policy, to which importance is attached in the preamble to
Regulation No 866/90 (fifth recital) and which is imposed by Articles l(2)(b), 2
and 8(2) of that regulation.

122 In particular, the investment aid at issue cannot be based on Decision 94/173. The
latter is unlawful in so far as it does not comply with the conditions for cofinancing imposed by Regulation No 866/90, which does not authorise the cofinancing of aid which is incompatible with the common agricultural policy.

123 The Commission denies that the aid at issue fails to comply with the conditions
and procedures laid down by Regulation No 866/90. That aid is intended solely
to enable the Portuguese authorities to facilitate the setting up of a sugar
processing plant in order to ensure the take-up of sugar beet harvested in the
region with a view to using the white sugar quota allocated to mainland Portugal.
II - 1935

JUDGMENT OF 17. 6. 1999 — CASE T-82/96

Findings of the Court

124 This plea is based essentially on the argument that the investment aid at issue is
excluded by Regulation No 866/90 because it is incompatible with the common
agricultural policy and cannot be based on Decision 94/173, which is itself
incompatible with that policy. It need merely be pointed out in that regard, as has
already been held (see paragraphs 89 and 90 above), that aid granted with a view
to utilising the quota allocated to mainland Portugal is not incompatible with the
aims of the common agricultural policy. The second plea cannot therefore be
upheld.

125 It follows that the present action for annulment must be dismissed as unfounded
in its entirety.

Costs

126 Under Article 87(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the unsuccessful party is to be
ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's
pleadings. Since the applicants have been unsuccessful, they must be ordered to
pay their own costs, together with those of the defendant and DAI, which have
applied for them.

127 Pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 87(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the
Portuguese Republic must bear its own costs.

THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE
(Fourth Chamber, Extended Composition)

hereby:

1. Dismisses the application;

2.

Orders the applicants to bear their own costs and to pay those of the
defendant and the intervener DAI — Sociedade de Desenvolvimento Agroindustrial SA;
