"It is apparent from the judgment under appeal and the documents included in the file that the appellants submitted before the General Court that, contrary to what the Commission stated in point 97 of the grounds of the contested decision, the normal tax rules for company profits could not be used as a valid basis for comparison and thus as a reference framework for the assessment of the selectivity of the tax scheme at issue.",prem
"The appellants then stated that, even if those rules were able to be used as a reference framework, the tax scheme at issue had not conferred any economic advantage on them.",prem
"The appellants lastly claimed that the general realignment scheme could not be used as a reference framework either, since its characteristics were totally different from those of the tax scheme at issue.",prem
"Even if that were the case, the tax scheme at issue did not confer any economic advantage as against the general realignment scheme.",prem
"It is apparent from those submissions that, according to the appellants, neither the normal tax rules for profits nor the general realignment scheme could be used as a reference framework and that, even if that were the case, the tax scheme at issue did not confer any economic advantage as against one or other of those schemes.",prem
"In order to respond to those arguments, the General Court, in paragraph 161 of the judgment under appeal, first of all duly reiterated the Court of Justice’s case-law on the determination of the reference framework for the purpose of checking whether a measure is selective in the following terms:",prem
"‘The Court of Justice has stated that the determination of the reference framework for the purpose of determining whether a measure is selective has a particular importance in the case of tax measures, since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with “normal” taxation ([Case C-88/03] Portugal v Commission [[2006] ECR I-7115], paragraph 56), that is to say, the taxation normally applicable to undertakings which are, in the light of the objective pursued by the scheme in question, in a factual and legal situation that is comparable to that of the undertakings benefiting from the scheme ([Case C-143/99] Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke [[2001] ECR I-8365], paragraph 41).’",prem
"The General Court then, in paragraphs 165 to 167 of the judgment under appeal, made the following observations:

‘165


It is necessary, first, to consider the [appellants’] complaints relating to the Commission’s choice of normal [corporation] tax as the reference framework and the finding made by that institution, within that framework, that there was a selective economic advantage.",prem
"166


In the present case, the Commission found that, although the system of fiscal neutrality established by Law … 218/1990 resembled, as regards gains realised but not recognised, the system of fiscal neutrality under Article 4 of … Decree … 358/1997 [the second sentence of point 99 of the grounds of the contested decision] — a finding which dictated that any realignment scheme that may be introduced by the legislature should be applied without distinction, under the same conditions, to gains realised in the context of either of those two systems [point 88 of the grounds of the contested decision] — the Italian Republic had limited the benefit of the realignment scheme under Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 to undertakings reorganised under Law … 218/1990 [point 90 of the grounds of the contested decision].",prem
"On the basis of those considerations, the Commission concluded that the Italian Republic had conferred a selective advantage on those undertakings, corresponding to the difference between the tax actually paid pursuant to Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 and the normal tax that would have been paid if the realignment had taken place in the absence of the preferential scheme [point 91 of the grounds of the contested decision].’",prem
"In paragraphs 169 to 172 and paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court then responded to the appellants’ complaints as regards the Commission’s choice of using the normal tax rules for profits as a reference framework, and dismissed them in the following terms:",prem
"‘169


However, it is not for the Commission, in examining a scheme in the light of the rules on State aid, to envisage the subjective choices that might have been made by the beneficiaries of that scheme in the absence of such a scheme but to examine the scheme in order to determine whether it entails, from an objective standpoint, an economic advantage by reference to the tax provisions from which it derogates which would normally have been applicable in the absence of the scheme (see, to that effect, Case C-148/04 Unicredito Italiano [2005] ECR I-11137, paragraph 118).",prem
"The fact that, in the absence of the realignment scheme at issue, the undertakings concerned would allegedly not have disposed of their assets is, in the context of such an objective assessment, irrelevant.",prem
"170


The [appellants] also claim … that the use of the normal tax as the reference framework is inappropriate because, whilst the application of the tax normally applied in the event of disposal would undoubtedly eliminate any misalignment of the assets for the establishment to which the assets were transferred under Law … 218/1990, it would, on the other hand, have no effect on the misalignment of the shares received by the transferring entity.",prem
"171


As regards the [appellants’] reference to the situation of the transferring entities under Law … 218/1990, it should be noted that the contested decision does not in any way concern those entities, but simply the banks to which assets were transferred under that law.",prem
"The Commission considered in the contested decision whether there was an advantage, and concluded that that was the case, solely in connection with those banks.",prem
"172


It follows that the repeated references made by the [appellants] in the present action … to the situation of the transferring entities under Law … 218/1990, in particular to the fact that the 2003 tax reform did not remove for those entities the risk of the double taxation of suspended gains distributed as dividends, are irrelevant.",prem
"186


It follows from the above considerations that, contrary to the [appellants’] claims, the Commission did not err in using the normal tax as a reference framework for the purpose of determining whether there was an economic advantage.’",prem
"Lastly, the General Court responded to the appellants’ complaints relating to the fact that the general realignment scheme could not be used as a reference framework, while observing, in paragraph 173 of the judgment under appeal, that the scheme set out in Article 2(25) of Law 350/2003 had not been chosen by the Commission as a reference framework, as follows:




‘With regard to the [appellants’] argument that the realignment scheme under Article 2(25) of Law … 350/2003 was not, to any greater extent than the normal tax, a valid reference framework …, — which, moreover, contradicts the argument set out at paragraph 174 below — it is sufficient to point out that the Commission did not in the contested decision use the scheme established by Article 2(25) of Law … 350/2003 as a reference framework.’",prem
"The General Court then responded, in paragraphs 182 and 183 of the judgment under appeal, to the appellants’ arguments relating to the comparison between the tax scheme at issue and the other realignment schemes as follows:

‘182


In view of that difference in the objectives of the two realignment schemes, it was not necessary to compare realignment under Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 with realignment under Article 2(25) of that law.",prem
"183


The only measure with which realignment under Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 could have been compared was the realignment measure in Article 19 of Law … 342/2000, by which the legislature had extended the benefit of realignment under Article 17 of Law … 342/2000 to undertakings that had been reorganised under Article 4 of Legislative Decree … 358/1997.’",prem
"It is apparent from those considerations that, in contrast to what is stated in the ground of appeal, the General Court did not give reasons which were unrelated to the contested decision since, in paragraphs 165, 173 and 186 of the judgment under appeal, it observed that the reference framework chosen by the Commission was the normal tax rules for profits and it was only to respond to the appellants’ arguments that it compared the tax scheme at issue and the general realignment scheme.",prem
"On that issue, the appellants state, in point 15 of their reply in the proceedings before the Court of Justice, that those arguments were not submitted in the alternative.",prem
It follows that the General Court was required to respond to them.,prem
"In addition, in paragraph 182 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that there was no need to compare the tax scheme at issue with the general realignment scheme, which was exactly what the appellants had maintained in points 98 to 100 of their application initiating proceedings before the General Court and as they point out in point 77 of their appeal.",prem
It is thus apparent that the appellants have been successful and that they have no legal interest in challenging the judgment under appeal on that issue.,prem
"As stated in paragraph 73 of this judgment, the appellants sought to establish that the companies to which assets had been transferred under Law 218/1990 were in a different legal situation from that of the other companies to which assets had been transferred.",prem
"In contrast to what is stated in the ground of appeal, the General Court, in paragraph 191 of the judgment under appeal, did not conclude that the tax scheme at issue was selective but merely held that the tax realignment schemes of those two categories of companies under Law 342/2000 were uniform.",prem
"addition, the General Court relied on other grounds in order to decide that the two categories of companies were not in different situations.",prem
"By these grounds of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for not having exercised its power of review to examine whether the tax scheme at issue was justified by the nature and general scheme of the Italian tax system.",prem
It is apparent from paragraphs 124 to 130 and from paragraph 200 of the judgment under appeal that the appellants submitted that the tax scheme established in Articles 17 and 18 of Law 342/2000 was extended only in respect of companies and entities which took part in transfers of assets in exchange for shares under the system of fiscal neutrality provided for in Article 7(2) of Law 218/1990.,prem
"They argued that, following the entry into force of Legislative Decree 344/2003 and the establishment of the special exemption regime known as ‘shareholding exemption’, the risk of double taxation disappeared for the companies and entities which carried out such transactions under the system of fiscal neutrality provided for in Article 4 of Legislative Decree 358/1997.",prem
"The Commission contended, as set out in paragraphs 150 to 152 of the judgment under appeal, that the entities which had transferred assets in transactions carried out under the scheme laid down by Law 218/1990 were no longer credit institutions and that, in the majority of cases, they were no longer undertakings.",prem
"In respect of the risk of double taxation, the Commission observed that the entities which had transferred assets in transactions carried out under Legislative Decree 358/1997 had never benefited from the tax realignment scheme set out in Article 18 of Law 342/2000.",prem
"The General Court responded to that line of argument in paragraphs 199 to 202 of the judgment under appeal as follows:

‘199


Next, it is necessary to consider the [appellants’] complaint … alleging that the Commission was wrong to consider that the selective nature of the scheme established by Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 could not be justified by the inherent logic of the system.",prem
"200


In that context, the applicants submit essentially … that the 2003 tax reform eliminated any risk of the double taxation of the gains arising on the transfer of assets under the system of fiscal neutrality established by Article 4 of Legislative Decree … 358/1997, namely the taxation of both the companies transferring and the companies in receipt of assets.",prem
"On the other hand, that reform did not remove the risk of the double taxation of the gains arising in connection with the transfer of assets under the system of fiscal neutrality introduced by Law … 218/1990. The [appellants] maintain that that explains the decision of the Italian legislature to extend the realignment scheme under Articles 17 and 18 of Law … 342/2000 only to assets transferred in the context of Law … 218/1990.",prem
"201


However, it should be recalled that the contested decision does not concern transferring entities but only banking establishments to which assets were transferred under Law … 218/1990 and the economic advantage reserved to those establishments by the scheme at issue.",prem
"Consequently, the fact that the transferring entities under Law … 218/1990 might have been taxed because there was a possibility of double taxation cannot be a factor that justifies a selective advantage being conferred on recipient banks by means of Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003.",prem
"202


The Commission was therefore correct to consider, at recital 105 in the preamble to the contested decision, that the scheme introduced by Article 2(26) of Law … 350/2003 conferred a selective advantage which had the effect of improving the competitiveness of credit institutions which were reorganised under Law … 218/1990 by comparison with other undertakings.’",prem
"According to the Court’s case-law, however, State aid, as defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is a legal concept which must be interpreted on the basis of objective factors.",prem
"For that reason, the European Union judicature must in principle and having regard both to the specific features of the case before it and to the technical or complex nature of the Commission’s assessments, carry out a comprehensive review as to whether a measure falls within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, inter alia, Case C-83/98 P France v Ladbroke Racing and Commission [2000] ECR I-3271, paragraph 25, and Case C-487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I-10515, paragraph 111).",prem
"Moreover, according to equally well-established case-law,the concept of State aid does not refer to State measures which differentiate between undertakings and which are, therefore, prima facie selective where that differentiation arises from the nature or the general scheme of the system of which they form part (see to that effect, inter alia, Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke, paragraph 42; Portugal v Commission, paragraph 52; British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 83; and Joined Cases C-106/09 P and C-107/09 P Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom [2011] ECR I-11113, paragraph 145).",prem
"It is apparent from those considerations that, in carrying out the necessary comprehensive review of the characterisation of the tax scheme at issue as State aid, the General Court had to examine whether the differentiation between undertakings arising from that scheme was due to the nature or general scheme of the tax system of which it formed part.",prem
"Admittedly, the Court of Justice has held that judicial review is limited with regard to whether a measure comes within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU, in a case where the appraisals by the Commission are technical or complex in nature (see, inter alia, France v Ladbroke Racing and Commission, paragraph 25, and British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 114).",prem
"However, the General Court did not find that this was the case here.",prem
"Thus, by merely observing that the contested decision did not concern the transferring entities without considering the tax realignment scheme in its entirety, and without having assessed the appellants’ and the Commission’s arguments, the General Court erred in law by failing to carry out a comprehensive review as to whether the tax scheme at issue came within the scope of Article 107(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, British Aggregates v Commission, paragraph 115).",prem
It follows that the fifth ground of appeal is unfounded.,conc
The judgment under appeal must therefore be set aside to the extent that it infringed Article 107(1) TFEU.,conc
