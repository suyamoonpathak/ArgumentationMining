"Article 92 of the Treaty states: `Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market.'",prem
"So, in order for there to be State aid within the meaning of that provision it is necessary, first, for there to be aid favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods and, second, for that advantage to come from the State or State resources.",prem
"It follows that if the reasoning in the contested decision to the effect that there was no advantage for the Belgian PMU was correct, the Court of First Instance was right to hold that that was enough in itself to justify the rejection of the complaint, and that it did not need to examine Ladbroke's argument that the Belgian PMU's French revenue came from a compulsory levy provided for under rules of French public law.",prem
"Consequently, it has to be considered whether the Court of First Instance was right to accept the reasoning in the contested decision to the effect that there was no treatment favouring the Belgian PMU.",prem
"Ladbroke challenges the reasoning in paragraphs 59 to 63 of the contested judgment, in which the Court of First Instance did not find fault with the finding in the contested decision that the Belgian PMU was not favoured because its revenue from bets taken in France under the contested agreement was obtained at a rate equivalent to that which it would have received if the bets on Belgian races were taken directly by it in Belgium.",prem
"The Court of First Instance stated, in particular, in paragraphs 60 and 62 of the contested judgment, that a comparison between the rate of revenue realized by the Belgian PMU in France and in Belgium on bets on Belgian races was the appropriate criterion for determining whether the Belgian PMU benefited from an advantage for the purposes of Article 92, since Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279 established as a general rule that bets on horse-races run abroad were to be subject to the statutory and fiscal levies in force in the country in which the races were organized.",prem
"According to the Court of First Instance, the way in which the levy on bets on Belgian races is treated in France, whereby the Belgian PMU receives a share of the levy comparable to that which it would receive if the Belgian statutory and fiscal retentions were applied, does not therefore constitute a measure which derogates from the scheme of the general system but on the contrary accords with that general system.",prem
"Ladbroke claims, however, that the comparison should have been between the levies on bets placed in France on non-French races and the levies on bets placed in France on French races.",prem
"If a Member State claims to regulate a particular economic activity (by way of taxation or imposition of levies), it must treat all such economic activity equally.",prem
"The general system for determining the statutory and fiscal retentions on betting in France should therefore, contrary to the finding of the Court of First Instance, be that established for bets placed in France and not that established by Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279, of which, moreover, the Belgian PMU is the sole beneficiary.",prem
It is true that a comparison between the revenue of the Belgian PMU in France and that which it would have received if the same bets had been taken in Belgium cannot be regarded per se as sufficient to justify the conclusion that there was no treatment favouring the Belgian PMU.,prem
"In paragraphs 61 to 63 of the contested judgment, however, the Court of First Instance examined Ladbroke's argument that the levy on Belgian races should be treated in the same way as the levy on bets on French races accruing to the PMU.",prem
Ladbroke's argument disregards the specific nature of bets on Belgian races and what differentiates them from bets on French races.,prem
"Since the two categories of bet are not identical, the existence of an advantage for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty cannot be deduced automatically from the difference of treatment to which they are subject.",prem
"In totalizator betting the stakes constitute a common pool which, after various levies, is distributed amongst the winners equally, whatever the origin of the bets.",prem
The share of the stakes paid out to the winners thus cannot vary according to the State in which the bets were placed.,prem
The proper functioning of such a system can therefore be ensured only if the rate at which any levies which may be imposed on the bets laid on a horse-race is that of the State in which the the race is run.,prem
"Furthermore, the system of statutory and fiscal retentions on bets on French horse-races was adopted in the light of the specific regulatory and economic conditions prevailing with regard to horse-racing and totalizator betting in France.",prem
"There can be no requirement to transpose that system to totalizator betting on Belgian horse-races, which are organized under different regulatory and economic conditions.",prem
"Moreover, since the levy rates in France and Belgium differ and the application of Belgian rates to bets placed in France is justified for reasons relating to the logic of the totalizator betting system referred to in paragraph 34 of this judgment, that levy cannot, in any event, be shared out between the various recipients on exactly the same basis in the two cases.",prem
"The French legislature therefore cannot be criticised for having treated bets on French races differently from bets on foreign races by providing, in Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279, that bets on horse-races abroad were to be subject to the statutory and fiscal retentions in force in the country where the races are organized.",prem
"Accordingly the Court of First Instance was entitled to hold, in paragraph 63 of the contested judgment, that it was not possible to accept Ladbroke's argument that the way in which stakes on Belgian races were treated, which allegedly produced the advantage to the Belgian PMU complained of, should be the same as the way in which the levy accruing to the PMU was treated.",prem
"Furthermore, that conclusion is not affected by the fact that the general system governing bets on horse-races abroad has hitherto been applied only to bets on horse-races organized in Belgium.",prem
"Article 15(3) of Law No 64-1279, which provides that the sociétés de courses authorized to organize off-course totalizator betting may be empowered to collect bets placed in France on foreign races, existed well before Decree No 91-118 was adopted and the contested agreement entered into, and both the latter follow the general system established by that provision.",prem
"In the light of the foregoing, the appeal must be dismissed.",conc
