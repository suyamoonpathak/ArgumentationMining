"Contrary to the assertions of the Commission and the Comunidad Autónoma de La Rioja, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did raise before the Court of First Instance, in the initial application itself, at paragraph 71 et seq., a plea alleging misuse of powers on the part of the Commission.",prem
That plea was examined with regard to Ramondín and the Territorio Histórico de Álava at paragraphs 82 to 88 of the judgment under appeal.,prem
"The Court of First Instance rightly observed that a measure is only vitiated by misuse of powers if it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been taken with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving an end other than that stated (see, inter alia, Case C‑110/97 Netherlands v Council [2001] ECR I‑8763, paragraph 137 and the cases cited).",prem
"At paragraphs 85 to 87, it analysed and assessed the applicants’ allegations and their arguments.",prem
It found that they had not adduced any objective evidence from which it could be concluded that the Commission’s real purpose in adopting the contested decision was to achieve tax harmonisation.,prem
"In doing that, the Court of First Instance undertook an assessment of the facts which does not, unless the clear sense of the evidence produced to it was distorted, constitute a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see inter alia Joined Cases C‑280/99 P to C‑282/99 P Moccia Irme and Others v Commission [2001] ECR I‑4717, paragraph 78, and Joined Cases C‑238/99 P, C‑244/99 P, C‑245/99 P, C‑247/99 P, C‑250/99 P to C‑252/99 P and C‑254/99 P Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I‑8375, paragraph 285).",prem
"The appellants confine themselves, by assertions, to challenging those findings of fact.",prem
They do not produce any evidence such as to establish that the Court of First Instance distorted the clear sense of the evidence produced to it.,prem
In any event it cannot be maintained that the Court of First Instance should have concluded from the absence of any complaint from a competitor that the Commission’s objectives were other than those stated.,prem
The mere fact that there was no complaint does not admit of such a hypothesis.,prem
It follows that the ground of appeal alleging misuse of powers must be rejected.,prem
"As regards the ground of appeal based on a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on this point, it must be held that Ramondín did not raise that plea in its appeal.",prem
"In stating, in its pleading lodged on 18 February 2004, that it was maintaining its ground of appeal concerning the failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal in relation to the plea alleging misuse of powers, Ramondín is thus, in reality, introducing a new plea in law.",prem
That plea is inadmissible under Articles 42(2) and 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.,prem
"As regards the Territorio Histórico de Álava, which put forward a ground of appeal concerning failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal and maintained it in its pleading lodged on 20 February 2004, it is to be noted that that judgment states:",prem
"at paragraph 85, that all the applicants’ arguments were based on speculation regarding possible underlying reasons for the contested decision and that they had not even shown that any harmonisation had in fact been achieved at Community level by the contested decision;",prem
"at paragraph 86, that the Territorio Histórico de Álava referred to the cases which gave rise to the order of the President of the Court of Justice of 16 February 2000 in Joined Cases C-400/97 to C‑402/97 Juntas Generales de Guipúzcoa and Others [2000] ECR I-1073, cases in which the Commission, in the applicant’s submission, undermined the legislative capacity of the Basque authorities in the field of taxation in finding that the Normas Forales constituted State aid since they were applicable exclusively to a particular area of a Member State;",prem
"at paragraph 87, that the last-mentioned argument had to be rejected, since in the contested decision the Commission had not taken the criterion of regional selectivity as a basis for establishing that the tax advantages from which Ramondín benefited constituted State aid falling within the scope of Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC).",prem
That statement of the grounds appears adequate in the light of the arguments presented before the Court of First Instance in the application and the reply.,prem
Those arguments did not include any reference to withdrawal of a series of tax measures from a list drawn up by a group set up within the Council.,prem
"It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.",prem
"In an appeal the Court’s jurisdiction is confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59, Case C‑7/95 P John Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I‑3111, paragraph 62, and Case C‑217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I‑3701, paragraph 37).",prem
"In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that:

–
    the impugned tax measures are precluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid;",prem
Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.,prem
"In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the measure reducing the basis of assessment in the course of argument concerning the selectivity of that measure, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measures as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.",prem
The Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal.,prem
"The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the tax measure at issue was excluded at the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.",prem
"This new plea must be declared inadmissible, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on the point of law raised, since the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.",prem
It follows that the Territorio Histórico de Álava’s ground of appeal concerning a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal so far as concerns the alleged misuse of powers on the part of the Commission must be rejected.,conc
It follows from all of the foregoing that the appeals must be dismissed.,conc
