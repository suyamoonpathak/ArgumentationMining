"Consequently, the fact that the authorisation decisions were adopted on a proposal from the Commission could not preclude those exemptions being classified as State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, if the conditions governing the existence of State aid were met.","It is clear, in that regard, from the contested decision that the Commission had taken the view, at the time when the Council adopted the authorisation decisions, that those decisions did not give rise to a distortion of competition and did not impede the proper functioning of the internal market (Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 83).",no-relation,premise,premise,A2013_European Commission v Ireland and Others

"The resulting economic advantages, according to the facts established in paragraph 5.3.2.6. of the decision at issue, corresponded to the advantages which the EIGs would not have achieved in the same operation by the sole application of general measures, namely the interest saved on the amounts of tax payments deferred by virtue of early depreciation, the amount of tax avoided or interest saved on tax deferred by virtue of the tonnage tax system and the amount of tax avoided on the capital gain made on the sale of the vessel.","It was also the EIGs which collected the tax benefits in two stages, as has been stated in paragraph 9 above, by the combination of the tax measures at issue.",support,premise,premise,A2018_Commission v Spain
"Therefore, contrary to what the Commission submits, the Italian Republic argued in its application at first instance that the Commission had infringed Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999 by classifying, in the decision at issue, the staggering of payments as new and unlawful aid, and by wrongly requiring that Member State to recover that aid.","Furthermore, in paragraph 57 of that application, the Italian Republic argued: ‘Nor is it possible to take the view that the recovery decision may be extended to existing aid as a result of a substantial alteration to that aid which is capable of resulting in those two measures being regarded as a single new aid, not notified to the Commission and therefore unlawful’.",support,premise,premise,A2017_European Commission v Italian Republic_DT
