"In the first place, as regards the plea alleging breach of the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, it should be made clear at the outset that Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 provides for a stage at which the aid measures notified undergo a preliminary examination, the purpose of which is to enable the Commission to form an initial view as to whether the aid notified is compatible with the common market.",prem,"['it make clear', 'aid measure number undergo examination']"
"On completion of that stage, the Commission is to make a finding either that the measure does not constitute aid or that it falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC.",prem,['measure number aid']
"In the latter case, it may be that the measure does not raise doubts as to its compatibility with the common market;",prem,['measure raise doubt']
"on the other hand, it is also possible that the measure may raise such doubts.",prem,['measure raise doubt']
"If, following the preliminary examination, the Commission finds that, notwithstanding the fact that the measure notified falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC, it does not raise any doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, the Commission is to adopt a decision not to raise objections under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999.",prem,['it raise doubt']
"Where the Commission adopts a decision not to raise objections, it declares not only that the measure is compatible with the common market, but also – by implication – that it refuses to initiate the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999.",prem,"['<ORG> adopt decision number', 'it declare number']"
"If, following the preliminary examination, it finds that the measure notified raises doubts as to its compatibility with the common market, the Commission is required to adopt, on the basis of Article 4(4) of Regulation No 659/1999, a decision initiating the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of that regulation.",prem,['measure number raise doubt']
"Under the latter provision, such a decision is to call upon the Member State concerned and upon other interested parties to submit comments within a prescribed period which must not as a rule exceed one month.",prem,[]
"In the present case, the contested decision is a decision not to raise objections, adopted under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999, the lawfulness of which depends on whether there are doubts as to the compatibility of the aid with the common market.",prem,['there be doubt']
"Since such doubts must trigger the initiation of a formal investigation procedure in which the interested parties referred to in Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999 can participate, it must be held that any interested party within the meaning of the latter provision is directly and individually concerned by such a decision.",prem,['doubt trigger initiation']
"If the beneficiaries of the procedural guarantees provided for in Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 are to be able to ensure that those guarantees are respected, it must be possible for them to challenge before the European Union judicature the decision not to raise objections (see, to that effect, Case C‑78/03 P Commission v Aktionsgemeinschaft Recht und Eigentum [2005] ECR I‑10737, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited; Case C‑487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I‑10515, paragraph 28; and Case C‑319/07 P 3F v Commission [2009] ECR I‑5963, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['they challenge decision number', 'they challenge Case', 'case law cite Case']"
"Accordingly, the specific status of ‘interested party’ within the meaning of Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999, in conjunction with the specific subject-matter of the action, is sufficient to distinguish individually, for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, the applicant contesting a decision not to raise objections.",prem,[]
"In the present case, first, it emerges from the judgment under appeal and, in particular, from paragraph 16 of that judgment that, by their action, Kronoply and Kronotex sought the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, adopted under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999.",prem,['<ORG> seek annulment']
"Secondly, in paragraph 77 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found, in essence, that Kronoply and Kronotex had to be regarded as interested parties within the meaning of Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999.",prem,[]
"In the second place, the Commission and ZSG claim that the General Court altered the subject-matter of the action in so far as it examined, in the context of the second plea alleging disregard for the interested parties’ procedural guarantees, the arguments raised in the context of the first plea, contesting the merits of the decision not to raise objections.",prem,['<ORG> alter subject matter']
"In that regard, although an applicant who contests a Commission decision not to initiate the formal investigation procedure must, in accordance with Article 44(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, define the subject-matter of its action in the application initiating proceedings, that requirement is satisfied to the requisite legal standard where the applicant identifies the decision which he seeks to have annulled.",prem,"['who test <ORG>', 'applicant define matter', 'applicant identify decision']"
"It matters little whether the application initiating proceedings states that it is seeking the annulment of ‘a decision not to raise objections’ – the term used in Article 4(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 – or of a decision not to initiate the formal investigation procedure, since the Commission takes a position on both aspects of the question by means of a single decision.",prem,"['it seek annulment', '<ORG> take position']"
"In the present case, it should be noted that, at first instance, Kronoply and Kronotex requested annulment of the Commission decision ‘not to raise an objection to the grant of aid by the Federal Republic of Germany’ to ZSG, invoking three pleas in law in support of their action.",prem,"['that request annulment', '<ORG> request annulment']"
"In that regard, the General Court found in paragraph 80 of the judgment under appeal that it was solely by their second plea that Kronoply and Kronotex expressly submitted that the Commission should have opened the formal investigation procedure.",prem,['<ORG> open investigation procedure']
"With regard to the first and third pleas, the General Court thus rightly pointed out in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal that, according to settled case-law, it was not for it, the General Court, to interpret an action challenging exclusively the merits of an aid assessment decision as such as seeking, in reality, to ensure the respect of the procedural rights available to the applicant under Article 88(2) EC, where the applicant has not expressly raised a plea to that effect.",prem,"['it interpret action', 'applicant raise plea']"
"In such circumstances, the interpretation of the plea would be tantamount to re-defining the subject-matter of the action (see, to that effect, the judgment of 29 November 2007 in Case C‑176/06 P Stadtwerke Schwäbisch Hall and Others v Commission, paragraph 25).",prem,[]
"In paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court nevertheless held that that limit on its jurisdiction to construe pleas in law does not have the effect of preventing it from examining arguments which the applicant has put forward regarding the substance, in order to ascertain whether strands of those arguments additionally support a plea, also raised by the applicant, which expressly alleges the existence of serious difficulties justifying initiation of the procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",prem,"['limit have effect', 'strand support plea', 'which allege existence']"
"Consequently, the General Court held in paragraph 83 of the judgment under appeal that it was entitled to examine the first and third pleas, in order to ascertain whether the arguments put forward in the context of those pleas could be linked to the plea alleging disregard for procedural guarantees.",prem,[]
"In that context, the General Court held in paragraph 86 of that judgment that the arguments relied upon in support of the first plea, in so far as they were intended to challenge the Commission’s decision not to initiate the formal investigation procedure, had to be examined at the same time as the arguments put forward in support of the second plea.",prem,[]
"In so doing, however, the General Court did not err in law.",prem,[]
"Where an applicant seeks the annulment of a decision not to raise objections, it essentially contests the fact that the Commission adopted the decision in relation to the aid at issue without initiating the formal investigation procedure, alleging that the Commission thereby acted in breach of the applicant’s procedural rights.",prem,"['applicant seek annulment', 'it test fact', '<ORG> adopt decision']"
"In order to have its action for annulment upheld, the applicant may invoke any plea to show that the assessment of the information and evidence which the Commission had at its disposal during the preliminary examination phase of the measure notified should have raised doubts as to the compatibility of that measure with the common market.",prem,"['applicant invoke plea', 'assessment raise doubt']"
"The use of such arguments does nothing, however, to bring about a change in the subject-matter of the action or in the conditions for its admissibility (see, to that effect, 3F v Commission, paragraph 35).",prem,[]
"On the contrary, the existence of doubts concerning that compatibility is precisely the evidence which must be adduced in order to show that the Commission was required to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 659/1999.",prem,[]
"Under Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999, ‘interested party’ means inter alia any person, undertaking or association of undertakings whose interests might be affected by the granting of aid, that is to say, in particular competing undertakings of the beneficiary of that aid.",prem,"['party mean alia', 'party mean person']"
"In other words, that term covers an indeterminate group of persons (see, to that effect, Case 323/82 Intermills v Commission [1984] ECR 3809, paragraph 16).",prem,['term er group']
"As a consequence, that provision does not rule out the possibility that an undertaking which is not a direct competitor of the beneficiary of the aid, but which requires the same raw material for its production process, can be categorised as an interested party, provided that that undertaking demonstrates that its interests could be adversely affected by the grant of the aid.",prem,"['provision rule possibility', 'which require material']"
"For that purpose, it is necessary for that undertaking to establish, to the requisite legal standard, that the aid is likely to have a specific effect on its situation (see, to that effect, 3F v Commission, paragraph 33).",prem,[]
"In the present case, after noting in paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal that, for a natural or legal person to be recognised as an interested party, that person must be able to show a legitimate interest in the implementation or non-implementation of the aid measures at issue or, if those measures have already been granted, in their maintenance, the General Court stated that, in the case of an undertaking, such a legitimate interest may consist, inter alia, in the protection of its competitive position, in so far as that position would be adversely affected by the aid measures.",prem,[]
"After finding in paragraphs 74 and 75 of the judgment under appeal that Kronoply and Kronotex are not competitors on the same product markets, but use the same raw materials – namely, industrial wood – in their production process, the General Court inferred from this that Kronoply and Kronotex are, in relation to ZSG, rival purchasers of wood.",prem,[]
"Subsequently, the General Court found in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that Kronoply and Kronotex had demonstrated that there had been at least a temporary increase in the price of wood and that, despite the fact that they had not demonstrated that that increase was the result of the entry into operation of the ZSG factory, it could not be ruled out that there had been negative effects for Kronoply and Kronotex, probably as a result of ZSG’s installation.",prem,[]
"On that basis, the General Court held in paragraph 77 of that judgment that Kronoply and Kronotex had ‘established to the requisite legal standard the existence of a relationship of rivalry, as well as the potential adverse effects on their market position, attributable to the grant of the aid at issue’.",prem,['<ORG> establish existence']
"In those circumstances, an error of law cannot be imputed to the General Court for holding, in essence, that undertakings which are not competitors of the aid recipient on the market for the goods which they manufacture can be covered by the notion of ‘interested parties’ within the meaning of Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999.",prem,[]
It follows from those considerations that the General Court was correct in holding that Kronoply and Kronotex were interested parties within the meaning of that provision.,prem,[]
"In those circumstances, the first and second grounds of appeal must be rejected in their entirety.",conc,[]
"Consequently, the third ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,[]
