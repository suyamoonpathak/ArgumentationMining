"As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be pointed out that Ellinikos Chrysos does not dispute the definition of a ‘near-production’ mine as used by the Commission and noted by the General Court, in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, according to which a mine is in a ‘near-production’ stage when it is or has been operational or has been the subject of a feasibility study.",prem,['<NAME> dispute definition']
"Since the Stratoni and Olympiada mines had been operational, but their activities had been suspended for non-economic reasons, and the Skouries mine had been the subject of a feasibility study, it cannot be claimed that the General Court erred in law by confirming that the assessment of the advantage granted to Ellinikos Chrysos by the transfer of the mines at issue concerned mines in a ‘near-production’ stage.",prem,[]
"In that regard, Ellinikos Chrysos, in criticising the General Court for having confirmed that the Stratoni mine was operational at the time of its transfer, misreads the judgment under appeal.",prem,['<NAME> misread judgment']
"In fact, the General Court confirmed, within the limits of its powers, that the assessment of the value of that mine was based on the fact that it had been operational and that its activities had been suspended for reasons which are not of such a nature as to affect its intrinsic economic value.",prem,[]
"Similarly, the appellant’s argument based on the absence of infrastructure and mining permits as regards the Skouries mine cannot be accepted.",prem,[]
"Such a state of affairs is not inconsistent with the recognition of a positive value for that mine, having regard, not only, to the definition, adopted by the Commission, of a mine in a ‘near-production’ stage, but also to the evaluation method used, as described in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, which is not disputed by Ellinikos Chrysos.",prem,[]
"As regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court, first, for not having replied specifically to the argument that the usefulness of the expert report in assessing the value of the mines at issue was called into question because of the purpose of the report.",prem,['appellant criticise <ORG>']
"In that regard, it must be pointed out, first, that, in the context of the appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that the plea alleging that the General Court failed to respond to arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that Statute, and from Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 27).",prem,['<ORG> address argument']
"In addition, the obligation to state reasons does not require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one-by-one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, the General Court’s reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (order of 13 December 2012, Alliance One International v Commission, C‑593/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:804, paragraph 28).",prem,"['obligation require <ORG>', 'it uphold argument', 'it exercise order']"
It is apparent from paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal that Ellinikos Chrysos relied on four arguments for its head of claim that the expert report was an unsuitable basis for the assessment of the value of the Cassandra mines.,prem,[]
"Although the General Court replied to the arguments relating to the date that the expert report had been drawn up, in paragraphs 93 to 95 of the judgment under appeal, to the definition of the concept of a mine which is operational, in paragraphs 96 to 98 of that judgment, and to the evaluation method, in paragraphs 100 to 104 of that judgment, the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up, which could have led to the unsuitable nature of that report for the assessment at issue.",prem,[]
"In those circumstances, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by holding, in paragraph 99 of the judgment under appeal, that Ellinikos Chrysos’ arguments that the Commission’s use of the expert report had to be rejected, without responding to the argument based on the purpose for which that report had been drawn up.",prem,['<ORG> infringe obligation']
"Secondly, even if, by criticising the General Court for having used elements of the expert report relating to future events, the appellant does not ask the Court of Justice to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, the appellant does not in any way indicate to what extent such a circumstance would disqualify the Commission’s assessment of the advantage which was granted to it.",prem,"['appellant ask <ORG>', 'circumstance disqualify <ORG>', 'which grant to']"
"Since those events in fact occurred, one of them indeed at a date before that set out in the expert report, it is not clear why such a circumstance would be such as to impair the usefulness of that report for the purpose of assessing the advantage granted.",prem,[]
"As regards the third part of the first ground of appeal, the General Court stated, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the expert report had taken account of the various costs necessary for the Skouries mine to commence production.",prem,"['expert report take account', '<ORG> mence production']"
"Therefore, that third part, by which the appellant submits that the assessment of the value of the Skouries mine did not reflect such costs, results from a misreading of the judgment under appeal.",prem,['assessment reflect company t']
"In any event, as regards the actual amount of those costs, it is apparent from paragraph 21 of the present judgment that Ellinikos Chrysos may not, at the appeal stage, request the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts, in general, and of the actual value of the mines at issue, in particular.",prem,[]
"As regards the first part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission’s approach which took account of the intrinsic value of the land attached to the Cassandra mines.",prem,"['<ORG> firm <ORG>', 'which take account']"
"That said, the appellant does not indicate to what extent such an approach is vitiated by a manifest error of assessment on the ground that account was not taken of the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation and that that land could not have another intended use than that found.",prem,['land company ld number have use']
"In fact, assuming that such a fact is capable of influencing the intrinsic value of the land at issue, the General Court pointed out, in paragraph 126, that the location and the specific nature of that land had been taken into account in the Commission’s assessment.",prem,[]
"Accordingly, the General Court cannot be reproached for having infringed its obligation to state reasons in any way.",prem,[]
"As regards the second part of the second ground of appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, and the appellant has not stated otherwise, that the value of the land used by the Commission after verification corresponded to that notified by Ellinikos Chrysos.",prem,[]
"Moreover, and as was stated in paragraph 42 of the present judgment, the Commission concerned itself with determining the intrinsic value of the land at issue.",prem,['<ORG> cerne itself']
"Therefore, and in so far as the Commission took into account, in the estimation of the value of all of the assets transferred, all of the costs required to operate the Cassandra mines and the specific nature of that land, the fact that the mines at issue were not in operation at the time of their transfer cannot, in itself, influence the intrinsic value of the land at issue.",prem,['fact not influence value']
"In any event, by disputing the assessment of the value of the land attached to the mines in dispute, such as follows from the judgment under appeal, Ellinikos Chrysos is in fact asking the Court to make a fresh assessment of the facts of the case, which it cannot require at the appeal stage, as has been pointed out in paragraph 21 of the present judgment.",prem,['<NAME> ask <ORG>']
It should be borne in mind that the appeal is limited to points of law and that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the relevant facts and to assess the evidence.,prem,['<ORG> have jurisdiction']
"Since Ellinikos Chrysos does not claim any distortion of those facts and evidence, its arguments in support of its second ground of appeal cannot succeed.",prem,['<NAME> claim distortion']
The third ground of appeal is based on the premise that the General Court erred in law as regards the appraisal of the Commission’s assessment of the value of the land relating to the Cassandra mining operations.,prem,[]
"As is apparent from paragraph 46 of the present judgment, Ellinikos Chrysos has not succeeded in demonstrating that that was the case.",prem,[]
"Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be upheld, in so far as the appellant complains that the General Court did not respond to the argument based on the purpose for which the expert report had been drawn up.",conc,[]
That ground of appeal must be rejected as to the remainder.,conc,[]
"Consequently, that ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,[]
The third ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.,conc,[]
