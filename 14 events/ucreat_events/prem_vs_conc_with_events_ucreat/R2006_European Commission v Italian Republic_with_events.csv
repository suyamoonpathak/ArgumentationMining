Both Italy and Wam contest the admissibility of the appeal.,prem,['Italy test admissibility']
Italy argues that the Commission’s contention that the judgment of the Court of First Instance is inconsistent with the case-law of the Court of Justice is a ground of appeal which does not relate to a point of law.,prem,[]
"In that respect, it should be borne in mind that, pursuant to Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, an appeal to the Court of Justice is to be limited to points of law and is to lie on grounds, in particular, of infringement of Community law by the Court of First Instance.",prem,[]
"As the Advocate General states in point 20 of her Opinion, the Commission’s appeal is based, precisely, upon the allegation that the Court of First Instance has infringed Community law by failing to follow and apply the interpretation of Articles 87 EC and 253 EC laid down in the case-law of the Court of Justice.",prem,['<ORG> infringe Community law']
It follows that the Italian Republic’s argument that the appeal is not based on a point of law must be rejected.,prem,[]
"Regarding Wam’s argument that the Commission’s appeal invites the Court of Justice, first, to review the substance of the judgment under appeal rather than being limited to a review of an ‘essential procedural requirement’ as laid down in Article 230 EC, and, second, to carry out a review of the substance over which the Court of Justice has no jurisdiction at the appeal stage, it should be noted that Article 230 EC gives the Court of Justice jurisdiction to review acts of Community institutions other than the Court of First Instance.",prem,"['<ORG> invite <ORG>', '<ORG> have number jurisdiction', 'EC give <ORG>', 'EC give jurisdiction']"
"Appeals against the judgments of the Court of First Instance are governed, however, by the terms of Article 225(1) EC and the Statute of the Court of Justice.",prem,[]
"Next, it must be noted that the obligation to provide a statement of reasons is an essential procedural requirement which must be distinguished from the question whether the reasoning is well founded, the latter being concerned with the substantive legality of the measure at issue (see to that effect, Case C‑310/99 Italy v Commission [2002] ECR I‑2289, paragraph 48).",prem,[]
"Since the objective of the Commission’s single ground of appeal is precisely to contest the legal analysis of the obligation of the Court of First Instance to provide a statement of reasons, the Commission cannot be criticised for inviting the Court of Justice to re-examine the substance of the contested decision.",prem,[]
It follows that Wam’s argument concerning the admissibility of the Commission’s single ground of appeal must be dismissed.,prem,[]
"According to settled case-law, the statement of reasons required by Article 253 EC must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted that measure in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the Court to carry out its review.",prem,['which adopt measure']
"It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons meets the requirements of Article 253 EC must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (Case C‑88/03 Portugal v Commission [2006] ECR I‑7115, paragraph 88 and the case-law cited).",prem,['statement meet requirement']
"Applied to the classification of a measure as aid, that principle requires a statement of the reasons for which the Commission considers that the measure concerned falls within the scope of Article 87(1) EC.",prem,['principle require statement']
"In that regard, even in cases where it is apparent from the circumstances under which it was granted that the aid is liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition, the Commission must at least set out those circumstances in the statement of reasons for its decision (see Portugal v Commission , paragraph 89 and the case-law cited).",prem,['<ORG> set circumstance']
"In that context, it should be noted that, also according to settled case-law, for the purpose of categorising a national measure as State aid, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the aid has a real effect on trade between Member States and that competition is actually being distorted, but only to examine whether that aid is liable to affect such trade and distort competition (Case C-222/04 Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others [2006] ECR I‑289, paragraph 140 and the case-law cited).",prem,['aid have effect']
"With regard more specifically to the condition that trade between Member States be affected, it follows from the case-law that the grant of aid by a Member State, in the form of a tax relief, to some of its taxable persons must be regarded as likely to have an effect on trade and, consequently, as meeting that condition, where those taxable persons perform an economic activity in the field of such trade or it is conceivable that they are in competition with operators established in other Member States  (see Portugal v Commission , paragraph 91, and Case C‑172/03 Heiser [2005] ECR I‑1627, paragraph 35).",prem,['person perform activity']
"Furthermore, the Court has held that, when aid granted by a Member State strengthens the position of an undertaking compared with other undertakings competing in intra-Community trade, the latter must be regarded as influenced by that aid (Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraph 141 and the case-law cited).",prem,['aid strengthen position']
"In that regard, the fact that an economic sector has been liberalised at Community level may serve to determine that the aid has a real or potential effect on competition and affects trade between Member States  (Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraph 142 and the case-law cited).",prem,['aid have effect']
"With regard to the condition of the distortion of competition, it should be borne in mind in that regard that, in principle, aid intended to release an undertaking from costs which it would normally have to bear in its day-to-day management or normal activities distorts the conditions of competition  (see Case C‑156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑6857, paragraph 30, and Heiser , paragraph 55).",prem,['intend distort company dition']
"In the circumstances of the present case, it must be held that the Court of First Instance did not infringe the case-law cited above concerning the Commission’s obligation to state reasons in matters of State aid by holding in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the reasoning provided in recitals 74 to 79 of the contested decision does not make it possible to understand how, in the circumstances of the present case, the aid at issue was likely to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition.",prem,['<ORG> infringe case law']
"Regarding the specific circumstances of the present case, the Court of First Instance correctly points out, in particular in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that the aid at issue is intended to finance, by means of loans at reduced rates, expenses for market penetration programmes in non-member States concerning the establishment of permanent structures or for trade promotion and that the grant equivalent is relatively small in amount.",prem,[]
"Furthermore, in paragraph 75 of the judgment, the Court of First Instance underlined that the aid is not intended directly and immediately to support exports to outside the EU, but to finance a market penetration programme.",prem,[]
"In light of the specific circumstances of the case, the Court of First Instance did not err in law by holding, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission is, in particular, obliged to examine whether the aid at issue is liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort competition, giving information relevant to their likely effects in the contested decision.",prem,[]
"In that regard, in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rightly explained that it would suffice that the Commission show correctly how the aid at issue was likely to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition.",prem,['<ORG> show company']
"The Court of First Instance notably stressed in that context that the Commission was not obliged to carry out an economic analysis of the actual situation of the relevant market or the patterns of the trade in question between Member States or to show the real effect of the aid at issue, in particular on the prices applied by Wam, or to examine Wam’s sales on the United Kingdom market.",prem,[]
"With regard to the practical implementation of those principles, the Court of First Instance was right to hold, in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, that a general reasoning such as that contained in recitals 75 and 77 of the contested decision, which is based on the reaffirmation of the principles flowing from the Tubermeuse judgment cannot, by itself, be considered to satisfy the requirements arising under Article 253 EC.",prem,[]
"Regarding the reasons set out at recitals 76 and 78 to the contested decision, the Court of First Instance, without erring in law, held, in paragraphs 68 to 74 of the judgment under appeal, that those recitals, even when read in combination with the principles set out in recital 75 of the contested decision and with the finding that the financial situation of Wam has improved are not sufficient to permit an understanding of how the aid at issue is liable, in the present case, to affect trade between Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition in that sector.",prem,[]
"Contrary to the claim of the Commission in that respect, the mere fact that Wam took part in intra-Community trade by exporting an important part of its production within the EU cannot suffice, in the particular circumstances of the case recalled in paragraph 55 of this judgment, to demonstrate those effects.",prem,['<ORG> take part']
"In that context, it should be noted, in particular, that although it follows from the case-law cited in paragraphs 50 and 53 of this judgment that such effects can, in principle, result from the fact that the beneficiary of an aid is active on a liberalised European market, the fact remains that in the circumstances of this case and contrary to the circumstances giving rise to those cases,  the aid at issue is not directly connected to the activity of the beneficiary on that market, but is intended to finance expenditure for a non-member State market penetration programme.",prem,[]
"In those circumstances, and all the more when it involves aid, the grant equivalent of which was of relatively low value, the effect of the aid on trade and on intra-Community competition is less immediate and even less discernible and this requires a greater effort to state reasons on the part of the Commission.",prem,"['it involve aid', 'this require effort']"
"Finally, as to the case-law cited in paragraph 54 of this judgment, according to which, in principle, the aid which is intended to release an undertaking from costs which it would normally have had to bear in its day-to-day management or normal activities distorts the conditions of competition, it is sufficient to note that the aid at issue is not in fact intended to release Wam from such costs.",prem,['aid distort dition']
"It follows from the above that the Court of First Instance, when it held in substance in paragraphs 62 to 76 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission should have carried out a more detailed analysis of the potential consequences of the aid at issue on intra-Community trade and on competition and should have given additional information, in the contested decision, concerning those effects, did not intend to depart from the case-law cited above but to take into account the specific circumstances of the case, and it cannot be accused of erring in law in this respect.",prem,"['<ORG> carry analysis', '<ORG> carry analysis']"
"Furthermore, that conclusion is not invalidated by the arguments advanced by the Commission with regard to the findings of the Court of First Instance in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,[]
"Those findings on the examination of the interdependence between EU and Far Eastern markets relate to the possibility of an indirect effect on trade and intra-Community competition, such as that referred to principally in the Tubemeuse judgement.",prem,[]
"While it is true that the examination of such interdependence cannot be required if it is demonstrated that the State aid directly affects the intra-Community markets, it must however be held that the contested decision, as has been confirmed in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, does not adequately demonstrate this.",prem,"['<ORG> affect market', 'decision demonstrate this']"
"Accordingly, the appeal must be held admissible.",conc,['appeal hold admissible']
It follows from all the above considerations that the appeal must be dismissed.,conc,[]
