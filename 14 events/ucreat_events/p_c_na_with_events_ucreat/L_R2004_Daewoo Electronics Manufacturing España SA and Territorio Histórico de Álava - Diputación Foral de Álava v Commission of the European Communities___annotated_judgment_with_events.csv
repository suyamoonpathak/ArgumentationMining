"It referred to Commission Decision 93/337/EEC of 10 May I - 10640 DEMESA AND TERRITORIO HISTÓRICO DE ÁLAVA v COMMISSION 1993 concerning a scheme of tax concessions for investment in the Basque country (OJ 1993 L 134, p.",0,[]

Demesa maintained that the provisions necessary for adjusting the regional legislation to Decision 93/337 had been laid down and that the Commission had expressed its approval of the solution adopted.,0,['<ORG> express approval']
"Accordingly, both the Spanish authorities and the Commission itself considered that the problem was solved.",0,[]
"For that reason, the Commission never initiated a procedure in respect of State aid or raised any objection against similar tax measures adopted subsequently.",0,['<ORG> never initiate procedure']
"It therefore led Demesa, and any trader subject to the regional legislation concerned,to entertain legitimate expectations that the tax measures adopted by the Diputación Foral de Álava were authorised by the Commission provided that they did not involve any infringement of Article 52 of the Treaty.",0,['it lead <ORG>']

"of the judgment under appeal, rejected its plea on the ground that the impugned tax measure had not been the subject of prior notification, contrary to the requirements of Article 93(3) of the EC Treaty (now Article 88(3) EC).",0,[]
"In its submission, in the context of the policy followed by the Commission at the time of its application for the tax credit of 45%, it was excessive to require a trader to ascertain whether the tax measure applicable to it satisfied the conditions of Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and should, in consequence, be notified to the Commission.",0,['tax measure satisfy company dition']
Demesa was therefore correct to invoke the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.,0,[]

"That declaration of incompatibility was not linked solely to breach of the principle of freedom of establishment but, as the Court of First Instance observed at paragraph 237 of the judgment under appeal, also to breach of the various rules relating to aid.",0,[]
"0 It is clear, moreover, that Decision 93/337 could only be based on a prior finding that the measures in question were in the nature of State aid.",0,[]
"I - 10642 DEMESA AND TERRITORIO HISTÓRICO DE ALAVA v COMMISSION 41 However, Demesa did not ascertain whether the aid it received had been authorised by the Commission.",0,[]
"In any event, in the absence of prior notification of the impugned tax measure, the appellant could not plead that the Commission had failed to act.",0,[]
"Accordingly, the Court of First Instance was correct to find that there had been no legitimate expectation.",0,[]
"Findings of the Court 44 It should be borne in mind, first, that in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Commission under Article 93 of the Treaty, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that article and, second, that a diligent businessman should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed (Case C-5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I-3437, paragraph 14; Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 51; and Case C-24/95 Alean Deutschland [1997] ECR I-1591, paragraph 25).",1,['procedure follow I-3437']
"In particular, where aid is paid without prior notification to the Commission, so that it is unlawful under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Alean Deutschland, cited above, paragraphs 30 and 31).",1,['recipient not have expectation']
"In the present case, the Court of First Instance stated at paragraph 235 of the judgment under appeal that it was not disputed that the tax credit of 45% had been introduced without prior notification, in infringement of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",1,[]
"At paragraph 236 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance correctly held, referring inter alia to Commission v Germany, cited above, that the argument based on the principle of the protection of legitimate interests could not be upheld.",1,[]
"At the following paragraph of that judgment, the Court of First Instance correctly stated that the applicant's argument was based on a misreading of Decision 93/337.",1,[]
"In that decision, as the Court of First Instance emphasised, the Commission had characterised the aid in question as incompatible with the common market not only because it was contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty but also, at Part V of that decision, in which the Commission examines the possibility of applying one of the derogations provided for in Article 92 of the Treaty, because it did not comply with the various rules relating to aid.",1,"['<ORG> characterise aid', '<ORG> examine possibility']"
"More specifically, in Decision 93/337 the Commission: — had stated that the aid in question included a tax credit of 20% in respect of investments (Part I); I - 10644 DEMESA AND TERRITORIO HISTÓRICO DE ALAVA v COMMISSION had considered that, for the purpose of applying the derogation provided for in Article 92(3) (c) of the Treaty, the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines of 19 August 1992 on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ 1992 C 213, p.",1,"['aid include tax credit', 'company dition lay OJ']"
"), which, after defining in point 2.2 the components of the category of small and medium-sized enterprises, stated, at point 4.1, fifth paragraph, that the Commission had decided to allow investment aid only up to the levels of 15% of the investment for small enterprises and 7.5% of the investment for other enterprises in the same category, were not satisfied (Part V); had ordered the Spanish authorities to ensure that the aid was granted, inter alia, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (Article 1(4)).",1,[]
It is thus apparent that Demesa could not infer from Decision 93/337 that a tax credit of 45% granted to an undertaking of a size allowing it to make a minimum investment of ESP 2 500 million required by the Sixth Additional Provision of Norma Foral 22/1994 could not be categorised as aid for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.,1,['it make investment']
"In the light of the terms of Decision 93/337, the appellant cannot therefore claim the possibility, which cannot be excluded (see Commission v Germany, cited above, paragraph 16), for the recipient of unlawful aid to rely on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful.",1,['appellant not claim possibility']
I - 10645 JUDGMENT OF 11.,0,[]
"4 — JOINED CASES C-183/02 P AND C-187/02 P 52 As regards the Commission's alleged failure to act, the Commission rightly claims that any apparent failure to act is irrelevant when an aid scheme has not been notified to it.",1,[]
It follows that the ground of appeal which Demesa bases on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations must be rejected.,2,[]
"The grounds of appeal whereby the Territorio Histórico de Álava alleges, first, incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measure as State aid incompatible with the common market and, second, failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point Arguments of the parties 54 Before the Court of First Instance, the Territorio Histórico de Álava maintained that the Commission had infringed Article 92 of the Treaty by considering the tax credit of 45% to be State aid incompatible with the common market, on the ground that Norma Foral 22/1994 constituted a specific measure favouring 'certain undertakings or the production of certain goods'.",0,"['<ORG> allege categorisation', '<ORG> infringe article', 'company stitute measure']"
"It claimed that, in any event, any selective nature which that measure might have was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system.",0,[]
"The Territorio Histórico de Álava complains that the Court of First Instance, at paragraphs 148 to 170 of the judgment under appeal, rejected that argument and thus erred in law in applying Article 92 of the Treaty.",0,['<ORG> reject argument']
"I - 10646 DEMESA AND TERRITORIO HISTÓRICO DE ÁLAVA v COMMISSION 56 In the pleading which it lodged on 20 February 2004, it states that it maintains its ground of annulment, but at an earlier stage than that of the categorisation of the impugned tax measure as State aid.",0,['it maintain ground']
"It claims that during the proceedings at first instance it maintained that the tax credit of 45% was outside the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty, in so far as, as a tax measure, it was justified as a means of attaining an economic-policy objective.",0,[]
The Court of First Instance considered that that did not preclude its categorisation as State aid incompatible with the Treaty.,0,['that preclude categorisation']
"That conclusion is incorrect, because it was formulated at an inappropriate point in the interpretation process.",0,[]
"In reality, the Court of First Instance should, before addressing any question of categorisation as State aid, have considered that a tax measure adopted before the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy (OJ 1998 C 2, p.",0,['<ORG> sidere tax measure']
") and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p.",0,[]
) was excluded from the review of State aid.,0,[]
"Where such a measure formed part of the industrial policy implemented by the Member State concerned, it was excluded from the outset from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty.",0,['measure form part']
"In the same pleadings, the Territorio Histórico de Álava further states that it also maintains its ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal as regards the point of law raised.",0,['it maintain ground']
"The Commission contends that, in its present form, the ground of appeal alleging incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measure as State aid incompatible with the common market, notwithstanding the amended form in which it is presented, still requires an examination by the Court of the question of the nature as aid of that measure.",0,['ground require examination']
The analysis carried out pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty contains no stage preceding that of discussion of whether the measure in question must be categorised as State aid; the fiscal nature of a measure is of no relevance to the determination of whether or not it constitutes aid.,0,['analysis tain number stage']

"In those circumstances, by disputing the competence of the Commission, the Territorio Histórico de Álava is persisting in challenging the categorisation as State aid of the impugned tax measure.",0,[]
"Findings of the Court 59 It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.",1,"['party put plea', 'it bring case']"
"In an appeal the Court's jurisdiction is thus confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59; Case C-7/95 P Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I-3111, paragraph 62; and Case C-217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I-3701, paragraph 37).",1,[]
"In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that: — the impugned tax measure is excluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid; Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.",1,[]
"In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the impugned tax measure in the course of argument as to whether that measure was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measure as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.",1,['company cerne categorisation']
T h e Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraphs 167 and 168 of the judgment under appeal.,1,['<ORG> examine argument']
"The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the impugned tax measure was excluded from the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.",1,['company stitute plea']
