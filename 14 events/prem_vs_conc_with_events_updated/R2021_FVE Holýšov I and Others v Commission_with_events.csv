"It should be noted that the decision-making nature of the 2004 letter, even if that were established, has no bearing on the lawfulness of the decision at issue.",prem,"['that be establish ', 'nature have number', ' bear lawfulness']"
"In that regard, the General Court held, in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, having regard to the information available to it, that the scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES, which was notified in 2014 and which gave rise to the decision at issue, was substantially different from the provisional scheme as set out in the 2003 draft law which was the subject of the 2004 letter.",prem,"['court hold paragraph', ' have regard', 'which be ifie 2014', 'which give rise', 'which give decision', ' set law']"
"That assessment by the General Court of the facts and evidence before it cannot be challenged before the appeal court, except where the facts have been distorted (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 May 2019, CJ v ECDC, C‑170/18 P, not published, EU:C:2019:410, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited), which is not relied on by the appellants, which claim only that the General Court did not examine the evidence adduced, nor did it take account of their offer to submit additional evidence.",prem,"['assessment can be not challenge company', 'fact have be distort ', ' see judgment', ' see effect', ' rely appellant', 'which claim ', 'court do examine evidence', 'it do take account', ' to submit evidence']"
"The plea in the application at first instance alleging that the Commission had found, in the 2006 decision, that the Czech scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES did not constitute State aid and that, consequently, that institution could not have decided to the contrary by the decision at issue, was rejected by the General Court in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, inter alia, on the ground that it had been put before it for the first time only in the reply and that, as a result, it constituted a new inadmissible plea.",prem,"['commission have find decision', ' stitute aid', 'number have decide company', 'number have decide decision', 'plea be reject court', 'plea be reject paragraph', 'plea be reject appeal', 'plea be reject ground', 'it have be put it', 'it have be put time', 'it have be put reply', 'company stitute plea']"
It is common ground that that plea was only put forward for the first time in the reply.,prem,"['plea be put time', 'plea be put reply']"
"Furthermore, contrary to what the appellants claim, it cannot be regarded as the extension of the first plea in the action before the General Court, which alleged that the 2004 letter, by which the Commission had adopted a position on the proposed scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES, was a decision.",prem,"['appellant claim ', 'it can be not regard extension', 'which allege ', 'commission have adopt position']"
"Moreover, the appellants were not in a position, either before the Court of Justice or the General Court, to provide reasons why that plea could not have been put forward earlier.",prem,"[' to provide reason', 'number have be put ']"
"Consequently, the General Court correctly applied Article 84(1) of its Rules of Procedure by rejecting that plea on the ground that it was out of time.",prem,"['company apply article', ' reject plea', ' reject ground']"
"According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, for infringement of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations to be established, it is necessary for an EU institution, by giving a citizen precise assurances, to have led that person to entertain justified expectations.",prem,"[' accord law', 'infringement to be establish ', ' give assurance', 'institution to have lead person', ' to entertain expectation']"
"Information which is precise, unconditional and consistent, in whatever form it is given, constitutes such assurances (judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 63).",prem,"['it be give ', 'company stitute judgment']"
"In that regard, in its 2004 letter, the Commission merely expressed a preliminary opinion on a draft of the promotion scheme which was adopted only the following year, the precise conditions of which were not then fully known.",prem,"['commission express opinion', 'which be adopt ']"
"Consequently, that letter did not give precise assurances that the initial scheme was not in the nature of State aid.",prem,['letter do give assurance']
"Therefore, the General Court did not err in its legal characterisation by holding in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal that that letter could not give rise to any legitimate expectation.",prem,"['court do number', ' hold paragraph', 'number give rise', 'number give expectation']"
Nor can the General Court be criticised for not taking the view that such an expectation could result from the alleged ‘2006 decision’.,prem,"['court can be criticise ', 'number take view', 'expectation result decision', 'company result decision']"
"As the General Court pointed out in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, that decision had not been placed on the file, nor even specifically identified by the appellants.",prem,"['court point paragraph', 'decision have be place file', 'number have be place file', ' identify appellant']"
"Nor do the appellants demonstrate that the General Court incorrectly characterised the Commission’s conduct between 2004 and the adoption of the decision at issue in finding, in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, that that conduct could not be regarded as having provided precise, unconditional and consistent assurances that there was no State aid.",prem,"['appellant do demonstrate ', 'court characterise duct', 'court characterise 2004', ' find paragraph', 'number be regard ', ' having provide assurance', 'there be aid']"
"Moreover, the appellants may criticise the General Court for failing to take into account certain other factors, which they claim to have submitted to it, only if that evidence proves that they could rely on a legitimate expectation that the initial scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES would be maintained.",prem,"['appellant may criticise court', ' to take factor', ' to take account', 'they claim ', ' to have submit it', 'evidence prove ', 'company ld rely expectation', 'scheme would be maintain ']"
The appellants have not shown that that evidence was sufficient to justify the legitimate expectation alleged.,prem,"['appellant have show ', ' to justify expectation']"
"In particular, the appellants do not effectively challenge the finding, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that exceptional circumstances should not be taken into account in the present case, in so far as that consideration was envisaged, in the judgment of 11 July 1996, SFEI and Others (C‑39/94, EU:C:1996:285), only in order to establish that, in certain cases, the repayment of State aid sought before a national court is inappropriate.",prem,"['appellant do challenge finding', 'circumstance should be take account', 'circumstance should be take case', 'circumstance should be take judgment', 'sideration be envisage ', ' seek rt']"
"By the first part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants, referring to the judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission (C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268, paragraphs 83 to 85), submit that it is not sufficient that the initial promotion scheme was financed by a compulsory levy to enable it to be regarded as being financed through State resources.",prem,"[' refer judgment', 'appellant submit ', 'scheme be finance levy', 'it to be regard ', ' be finance resource']"
"However, it must be pointed out that that argument is based on a misreading of that judgment.",prem,"['it must be point ', 'argument be base misreading']"
"It is apparent from that judgment that the fact of coming from a compulsory levy is, on the contrary, sufficient to identify State resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission, C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268, paragraphs 65 to 72).",prem,"[' to identify resource', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"On the other hand, it is irrelevant that the financing mechanism at issue does not, strictly speaking, fall within the category of fiscal levies under national law (see, to that effect, order of 22 October 2014, Elcogás, C‑275/13, not published, EU:C:2014:2314, paragraph 31).",prem,"['mechanism do number ', ' fall category', ' see order', ' see effect']"
The first part of the fourth ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.,prem,['part must be reject ']
"By the second part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court, in any event, infringed EU law and committed a procedural irregularity in finding that there was a compulsory levy.",prem,"['appellant submit ', 'court infringe law', 'court mitte irregularity', 'there be levy']"
"However, even if that finding were incorrect, that error would vitiate the interpretation of national law.",prem,['error would vitiate interpretation']
"The interpretation of national law by the General Court is not open to challenge before the appeal court, except where the facts have been distorted (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited), which has not been alleged in the present case by the appellants.",prem,"[' challenge rt', 'fact have be distort ', ' see judgment', ' see effect', 'which have be allege case', 'which have be allege appellant']"
"Accordingly, this part of that ground of appeal must also be rejected as inadmissible.",prem,['part must be reject ']
"By the third part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for vitiating its judgment with a procedural irregularity by disregarding the evidence which they had adduced to the General Court or which they had proposed to be communicated to that court.",prem,"['appellant criticise court', ' vitiate judgment', ' vitiate irregularity', ' disregard evidence', 'they have adduce court', 'they have propose ', ' to be municate rt']"
"However, that part, which does not indicate the elements which are being referred to, is presented in terms that are too imprecise to enable the Court to assess its merits,",prem,"['which do indicate element', 'which be be refer ', 'part be present term', ' to enable court', ' to assess merit']"
with the result that it must also be rejected as inadmissible.,prem,['it must be reject ']
"The appellants submit, in essence, that, in paragraphs 130 to 136 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly held that the ‘review mechanism’ of the scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES had not been imposed by the Commission on the Czech Republic and that that mechanism did not exceed the requirements laid down in the 2008 Guidelines applicable to the facts at issue.",prem,"['appellant submit essence', 'court hold ', 'mechanism have be impose commission', 'mechanism have be impose republic', 'mechanism do exceed requirement', ' lay guidelines']"
"However, first, the factual assessment that the Czech Republic voluntarily undertook to implement the ‘review mechanism’ does not, as is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraph 24 above, fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice when hearing an appeal, except where the facts have been distorted, which is not alleged by the appellants.",prem,"['republic undertake ', ' to implement mechanism', ' cite paragraph', ' fall jurisdiction', ' hear appeal', 'fact have be distort ', ' allege appellant']"
"Secondly, since the review mechanism must be regarded as having been introduced by the Czech Republic, any failure to comply with the 2008 Guidelines has no bearing on the General Court’s assessment of the legality of the decision at issue adopted by the Commission.",prem,"['mechanism must be regard ', ' having be introduce republic', ' to ply guidelines', 'failure have number', ' bear assessment', ' adopt commission']"
"First, assuming that the criticism that the General Court made a twofold error in finding that the initial promotion scheme provided for the fixing of tariff levels and was financed by a tax does not relate to an assessment of the facts, which does not as such fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice when hearing an appeal, it must be held that the appellants have not established that the General Court’s assessment on that point is incorrect.",prem,"['court make error', 'scheme provide fixing', 'scheme be finance tax', 'criticism do relate assessment', 'which do fall jurisdiction', ' hear appeal', 'it must be hold ', 'appellant have establish ']"
"Secondly, although by a second part of the sixth ground of appeal the appellants criticise the General Court’s rejection of the seventh plea in their action at first instance on the ground that it lacks precision, their arguments are themselves too imprecise to enable the Court of Justice’s to assess the merits.",prem,"['appellant criticise rejection', 'appellant criticise action', 'appellant criticise instance', 'appellant criticise ground', 'it lack precision', ' to enable court', ' to assess merit']"
It must be stated that the appellants set out the complaint which they criticise the General Court for having misunderstood in the same terms as paragraph 144 of the judgment under appeal.,prem,"['it must be state ', 'appellant set plaint', 'they criticise court', 'they criticise term']"
"Thus, the first part of the seventh ground of appeal has no factual basis.",prem,['part have basis']
"As for the second part of this ground of appeal, it is ineffective, since it is not directed against the judgment under appeal.",prem,[' direct judgment']
"Furthermore, and in any event, the General Court held that the Commission had responded to the arguments raised during the administrative procedure, and that assessment is not open to challenge in an appeal, unless there has been a distortion of the facts, which is not alleged in the present case.",prem,"['court hold ', 'commission have respond argument', ' raise procedure', ' allege case']"
"By their eighth ground of appeal, the appellants, in essence, criticise the General Court for not finding, in paragraphs 157 to 163 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had exceeded the limits of its powers by asserting in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law, and, secondly, that any compensation granted, as the case may be, by an arbitration decision in itself constitutes State aid, infringes Article 108 TFEU and cannot therefore be enforced.",prem,"['appellant criticise court', 'appellant criticise finding', 'commission have exceed limit', ' assert decision', 'republic have infringe principle', ' grant decision', 'pensation stitute aid', 'company stitute aid', 'pensation infringe tfeu', 'company infringe tfeu']"
"In paragraphs 160 and 161 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court also erred in refusing to identify, in those assertions, the evidence of misuse of powers.",prem,"['court err ', ' to identify evidence', ' to identify assertion']"
"It is common ground that the Commission stated in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of legitimate expectations under national law and, secondly, that any compensation which an arbitration tribunal might grant would, in itself, constitute State aid, would infringe Article 108 TFEU and would therefore not be enforceable.",prem,"['commission state decision', 'republic have infringe principle', 'tribunal might grant ', 'pensation would stitute aid', 'republic would infringe tfeu']"
"However, as the General Court found in paragraphs 158 and 159 of the judgment under appeal, those assertions do not form part of the necessary grounds for the decision at issue.",prem,"['court find paragraph', 'court find appeal', 'assertion do form part']"
"Therefore, the General Court was fully entitled to reject as ineffective the complaints alleging that those assertions were unlawful.",prem,"['court be entitle ', ' to reject plaint']"
"Moreover, in paragraph 158 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court expressly accepted that the Commission lacked competence to make a decision on compliance with the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law.",prem,"['court accept ', 'commission lack petence', ' to make decision']"
"As regards the existence of a misuse of powers, which the General Court did not take into account, it should be recalled that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it where, as in the present case, there is no allegation of distortion of that evidence.",prem,"[' regard existence', 'court do take account', 'it should be recall ', 'court have jurisdiction', ' to assess value', 'which should be attach evidence', ' produce it', 'there be allegation']"
"Consequently, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,['ground must be reject ']
It follows that the second ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow ', 'ground must be reject ']"
It follows from the foregoing that the third ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow forego', 'ground must be reject ']"
It follows from the foregoing that the fourth ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow forego', 'ground must be reject ']"
It follows from the foregoing that the fifth ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow forego', 'ground must be reject ']"
"Consequently, the sixth ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,['ground must be reject ']
It follows that the seventh ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow ', 'ground must be reject ']"
