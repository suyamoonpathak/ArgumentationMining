"Contrary to the assertions of the Commission and the Comunidad Autónoma de La Rioja, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did raise before the Court of First Instance, in the initial application itself, at paragraph 71 et seq., a plea alleging misuse of powers on the part of the Commission.",prem,"['lava do raise plea', 'lava do raise court', 'lava do raise application', 'lava do raise .', ' allege misuse']"
That plea was examined with regard to Ramondín and the Territorio Histórico de Álava at paragraphs 82 to 88 of the judgment under appeal.,prem,"['plea be examine regard', 'plea be examine paragraph', 'plea be examine appeal']"
"The Court of First Instance rightly observed that a measure is only vitiated by misuse of powers if it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been taken with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving an end other than that stated (see, inter alia, Case C‑110/97 Netherlands v Council [2001] ECR I‑8763, paragraph 137 and the cases cited).",prem,"['court observe ', 'measure be vitiate misuse', 'it appear basis', ' to have be take purpose', ' achieve end']"
"At paragraphs 85 to 87, it analysed and assessed the applicants’ allegations and their arguments.",prem,"['it analyse ', 'it assess allegation']"
It found that they had not adduced any objective evidence from which it could be concluded that the Commission’s real purpose in adopting the contested decision was to achieve tax harmonisation.,prem,"['it find ', 'they have adduce evidence', 'company ld be clude ', ' adopt decision', ' to achieve harmonisation']"
"In doing that, the Court of First Instance undertook an assessment of the facts which does not, unless the clear sense of the evidence produced to it was distorted, constitute a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see inter alia Joined Cases C‑280/99 P to C‑282/99 P Moccia Irme and Others v Commission [2001] ECR I‑4717, paragraph 78, and Joined Cases C‑238/99 P, C‑244/99 P, C‑245/99 P, C‑247/99 P, C‑250/99 P to C‑252/99 P and C‑254/99 P Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I‑8375, paragraph 285).",prem,"[' do that', 'court undertake assessment', 'which do number ', ' produce it', 'sense be distort ', ' stitute question', ' see cases', ' see commission']"
"The appellants confine themselves, by assertions, to challenging those findings of fact.",prem,"['company fine themselves', 'company fine assertion', ' challenge finding']"
They do not produce any evidence such as to establish that the Court of First Instance distorted the clear sense of the evidence produced to it.,prem,"['they do produce evidence', 'court distort sense', ' produce it']"
In any event it cannot be maintained that the Court of First Instance should have concluded from the absence of any complaint from a competitor that the Commission’s objectives were other than those stated.,prem,"['it can be not maintain ', ' have clude absence']"
The mere fact that there was no complaint does not admit of such a hypothesis.,prem,"['there be plaint', 'fact do admit hypothesis', 'number do admit hypothesis']"
It follows that the ground of appeal alleging misuse of powers must be rejected.,prem,"['it follow ', ' allege misuse', 'ground must be reject ']"
"As regards the ground of appeal based on a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on this point, it must be held that Ramondín did not raise that plea in its appeal.",prem,"[' regard ground', ' base failure', ' to state ground', ' to state point', 'it must be hold ', 'ramondn do raise plea', 'ramondn do raise appeal']"
"In stating, in its pleading lodged on 18 February 2004, that it was maintaining its ground of appeal concerning the failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal in relation to the plea alleging misuse of powers, Ramondín is thus, in reality, introducing a new plea in law.",prem,"[' state pleading', ' lodge february', 'it be maintain company', ' cerne failure', ' to state ground', ' to state relation', ' allege misuse', 'ramondn be introduce plea', 'ramondn be introduce law']"
That plea is inadmissible under Articles 42(2) and 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.,prem,[]
"As regards the Territorio Histórico de Álava, which put forward a ground of appeal concerning failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal and maintained it in its pleading lodged on 20 February 2004, it is to be noted that that judgment states:",prem,"[' regard lava', 'which put failure', ' to state ground', ' to state appeal', 'which maintain it', 'which maintain pleading', ' lodge february', 'judgment state ']"
"at paragraph 85, that all the applicants’ arguments were based on speculation regarding possible underlying reasons for the contested decision and that they had not even shown that any harmonisation had in fact been achieved at Community level by the contested decision;",prem,"['argument be base speculation', ' regard reason', 'they have show ', 'harmonisation have be achieve level', 'harmonisation have be achieve decision']"
"at paragraph 86, that the Territorio Histórico de Álava referred to the cases which gave rise to the order of the President of the Court of Justice of 16 February 2000 in Joined Cases C-400/97 to C‑402/97 Juntas Generales de Guipúzcoa and Others [2000] ECR I-1073, cases in which the Commission, in the applicant’s submission, undermined the legislative capacity of the Basque authorities in the field of taxation in finding that the Normas Forales constituted State aid since they were applicable exclusively to a particular area of a Member State;",prem,"['lava refer case', 'which give rise', 'which give order', 'commission undermine capacity', 'company stitute aid']"
"at paragraph 87, that the last-mentioned argument had to be rejected, since in the contested decision the Commission had not taken the criterion of regional selectivity as a basis for establishing that the tax advantages from which Ramondín benefited constituted State aid falling within the scope of Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC).",prem,"['argument have ', 'commission have take criterion', 'commission have take basis', 'ramondn benefit company', 'advantage stitute aid', ' fall scope']"
That statement of the grounds appears adequate in the light of the arguments presented before the Court of First Instance in the application and the reply.,prem,"['statement appear adequate', 'statement appear light', ' present court', ' present application']"
Those arguments did not include any reference to withdrawal of a series of tax measures from a list drawn up by a group set up within the Council.,prem,"['argument do include reference', ' draw group', ' set council']"
"It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.",prem,"['it must be bear mind', 'party to put plea', 'party to put time', 'party to put court', 'it have raise court', 'it to bring case', 'it to bring court', 'which come court']"
"In an appeal the Court’s jurisdiction is confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59, Case C‑7/95 P John Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I‑3111, paragraph 62, and Case C‑217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I‑3701, paragraph 37).",prem,"[' fine review', ' argue court', 'jurisdiction be see case']"
"In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that:

–
    the impugned tax measures are precluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid;",prem,"['company tend instance', 'measure be preclude scope']"
Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.,prem,"['article have apply provision', 'article have apply clusion', ' relate taxation']"
"In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the measure reducing the basis of assessment in the course of argument concerning the selectivity of that measure, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measures as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.",prem,"['it refer objective', 'it refer stage', ' reduce basis', ' cerne selectivity', ' cerne categorisation']"
The Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal.,prem,"['court examine argument', 'court examine paragraph', 'court examine appeal']"
"The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the tax measure at issue was excluded at the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.",prem,"[' submit court', ' submit appeal', 'measure be exclude outset', 'measure be exclude stage', 'measure be exclude scope', ' precede reasoning', 'company stitute plea', ' raise time', ' raise appeal']"
"This new plea must be declared inadmissible, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on the point of law raised, since the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.",prem,"['plea must be declare inadmissible', ' allege failure', ' to state ground', 'latter can be not dissociate former']"
It follows that the Territorio Histórico de Álava’s ground of appeal concerning a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal so far as concerns the alleged misuse of powers on the part of the Commission must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow ', ' to state ground', 'company cern misuse', 'failure must be reject ']"
It follows from all of the foregoing that the appeals must be dismissed.,conc,"['it follow all', 'appeal must be dismiss ']"
