"Contrary to what the Commission and the Irish Government claim, the first part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal is not ineffective.",prem,['commission claim ']
"Ryanair stated, in its appeal, that that part concerns not only paragraph 74 but also paragraphs 75 and 76 of the Ryanair judgment.",prem,"['ryanair state appeal', 'cern number paragraph', 'cern number judgment']"
"Moreover, those three paragraphs develop, essentially, one and the same line of reasoning, based on the fact that, during the period covered by the decision at issue, the EUR 3 rate did not apply and could not therefore be used as the reference rate.",prem,"['paragraph develop line', ' base fact', 'company ere decision', 'rate do apply ', 'number be use rate']"
"However, as regards the substance, Ryanair’s arguments cannot succeed.",prem,"[' regard substance', 'argument can not succeed ']"
"It is the Court’s established case-law that, when appraising the requirement of selectivity, Article 107(1) TFEU requires assessment of whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ in comparison with others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' appraise requirement', 'that require assessment', 'tfeu require assessment', ' to favour undertaking', ' pursue regime']"
"As the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 41 of his Opinion, that assessment cannot be carried out by comparing the amount which the airlines subject to the lower rate of ATT were required to pay with a hypothetical tax amount, calculated on the basis or a rate which, as Ryanair itself accepts, did not apply to any flight or any airline during the period covered by the decision at issue .",prem,"['general observe essence', 'general observe point', 'assessment can be not carry ', 'company pare amount', 'company pare amount', 'airline be require ', ' calculate basis', 'ryanair accept ', ' do apply flight', ' do apply period', ' ere decision', ' ere issue']"
"Thus, the General Court was correct to state, in paragraph 75 of the Ryanair judgment, that fixing a reference rate other than that actually applied during the period in question would not allow all the effects of ATT to be fully apprehended.",prem,"[' to state paragraph', ' fix rate', ' apply period', 'fix would number allow ', 'effect to be apprehend ']"
"Contrary to what is submitted by the Irish Government, Ryanair has set out to the requisite legal standard the reasons why it considers that paragraph 89 of the Ryanair judgment is vitiated by an error of law.",prem,"['what be submit government', 'ryanair have set reason', 'ryanair have set standard', 'company sider ', 'paragraph be vitiate error']"
"The fact nonetheless remains that those reasons are not such as to call into question the grounds of the General Court’s rejection of Ryanair’s argument, so that this part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal must also be discounted.",prem,"['number remain ', ' to call ground', ' to call question', 'part must be discount ']"
"As the General Court observed, in essence, in paragraph 89 of the Ryanair judgment, if the Court were to find that the lower rate of ATT did not procure a selective advantage for the undertakings liable to pay that rate on the sole ground that that rate was introduced at the same time as the rate of EUR 10 per passenger, that would be tantamount to a finding that the decision whether a State intervention measure constituted State aid depended on the technique used.",prem,"['court observe essence', 'court observe paragraph', 'rate do procure advantage', 'rate do procure ground', ' to pay rate', 'rate be introduce time', 'company stitute aid', 'decision depend technique']"
"As is apparent from the Court’s established case-law, Article 107(1) TFEU does not draw a distinction between measures of State intervention on the basis of the techniques used by the national authorities (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 87 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['tfeu do draw distinction', ' use authority', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"As regards, first, the first part of Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal, it should be noted that the only decisive factor for determining whether a tax measure is to be classified as State aid and, in particular, for ascertaining whether that measure gives rise to more favourable tax treatment for its beneficiaries by comparison with other taxpayers, is the effects produced by the measure (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 87 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' regard part', ' to be classify aid', 'measure give rise', 'measure give treatment', ' produce measure', ' see effect']"
"Accordingly, the fact that a tax measure is contrary to provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU does not mean that the exemption from that measure enjoyed by certain taxpayers cannot be classified as State aid, as long as the measure in question produces effects vis-à-vis other taxpayers and has not been either repealed or declared unlawful and, therefore, inapplicable (see, to that effect, judgment of 30 March 2005, Heiser, C‑172/03, EU:C:2005:130, paragraph 38).",prem,"['fact mean ', ' enjoy taxpayer', 'exemption can be not classify aid', 'measure produce effect', 'measure produce taxpayer', ' have be repeal c172/03', ' declare unlawful', ' see effect']"
"That is, in essence, what the General Court stated in paragraph 43 of the Aer Lingus judgment and in paragraph 65 of the Ryanair judgment.",prem,['court state paragraph']
"Accordingly, contrary to what is claimed by Aer Lingus in the first part of its single ground of appeal, paragraph 43 of the Aer Lingus judgment is not vitiated by any error of law.",prem,"['what be claim lingus', 'what be claim part', ' be vitiate error']"
That conclusion is not called into question by the case-law relied on by Aer Lingus and cited in paragraph 60 above.,prem,"[' call question', ' call law', ' rely lingus', ' cite paragraph']"
The effect of that case-law is simply that the reimbursement to an undertaking of an amount of tax which it was required to pay in breach of EU law or the damages which national authorities are ordered to pay to undertakings to compensate for the damage they have caused them does not constitute State aid.,prem,"['it be require ', ' to pay breach', 'authority be order ', ' to pay damage', 'they have cause they']"
"The State aid with which the decision at issue is concerned derives neither from the reimbursement of a tax contrary to the provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU that was paid by Aer Lingus and Ryanair, nor from the payment of compensation to those two undertakings.",prem,"['aid derive reimbursement', 'that be pay lingus']"
That case-law is therefore irrelevant for the purposes of the present cases.,prem,[]
It follows that the first part of the Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal must be rejected.,prem,"['it follow ', 'part must be reject ']"
"Next, the second to fourth parts of Aer Lingus’ single ground of appeal and the second and third parts of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal are based on the premiss that the fact that ATT is totally or partially at odds with provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU is likely to have a bearing on whether the total or partial exemption from that tax enjoyed by certain operators may be described as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, in so far as, in particular, the unlawfulness of that measure could give rise, in proceedings before the national courts, to the repayment of all or part of the tax in question to other operators who were not entitled to the exemption in question.",prem,"['part be base premiss', ' to have bearing', ' enjoy operator', 'exemption may be describe aid', 'exemption may be describe meaning', 'unlawfulness give rise', 'unlawfulness give proceeding', 'unlawfulness give repayment']"
"It is common ground that, when the Commission carried out its assessment and adopted the decision at issue, the tax measure in question was producing its effects, in the sense that certain airlines were paying ATT at the reduced rate, whereas others — which, according to the Commission’s assessment that went unchallenged by Aer Lingus and Ryanair, were in a comparable legal and factual situation in the light of the objectives of the tax measure at issue — were paying the same tax at the higher rate.",prem,"['commission carry assessment', 'commission adopt decision', 'measure be produce effect', 'measure be produce sense', 'airline be pay att', 'airline be pay rate', ' accord assessment', 'that go lingus', 'other be pay tax', 'other be pay rate']"
"It follows from the considerations set out in paragraphs 68 and 69 above that the Commission was obliged to take account of those effects and could not ignore them simply on the basis that the airlines subject to less favourable tax treatment might obtain reimbursement of the excess tax which they had paid by commencing proceedings before the national courts, where appropriate on the basis of provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU.",prem,"['it follow sideration', ' set paragraph', 'commission be oblige basis', ' to take account', ' to take effect', ' ignore they', 'airline might obtain reimbursement', 'they have pay basis', ' mence proceeding']"
"It should be noted that it is not for the Commission but for the national courts to give a definitive decision on any claim for reimbursement of a tax alleged to be unlawful in the light of the law of the Member State concerned or contrary to the provisions of EU law other than Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, if necessary after those court have obtained from the Court of Justice, by way of a reference for a preliminary ruling, such clarification as may be necessary on the scope and interpretation of EU law.",prem,"[' to give decision', ' have obtain clarification', ' have obtain court', ' have obtain way']"
"The effectiveness of Article 107 TFEU would be substantially diminished if the Commission were required, before classifying a measure as State aid within the meaning of that provision, to wait for the decision of the courts with jurisdiction regarding any reimbursement of excess tax or tax paid by certain taxpayers.",prem,"['effectiveness would be diminish ', 'commission be require ', ' classify measure', ' classify aid', ' classify meaning', ' to wait decision', ' regard reimbursement', ' pay taxpayer']"
"As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, contrary to what is claimed by Ryanair, the Commission’s single ground of appeal is not ineffective.",prem,['what be claim ryanair']
"According to the Court’s well-established case-law, in an appeal, complaints directed against a ground included in a judgment of the General Court purely for the sake of completeness must be immediately dismissed as ineffective, since they cannot lead to the judgment under appeal being set aside (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' accord law', ' direct ground', ' direct sake', ' include judgment', 'plaint must be dismiss ', 'they can not lead ', 'judgment be set ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"However, in the present cases, contrary to Ryanair’s assertions, paragraphs 120 to 149 of the Ryanair judgment do not put forward three distinct grounds, each of which would be sufficient in itself to justify the annulment of Article 4 of the decision at issue.",prem,"['paragraph do put ground', ' to justify annulment']"
"Those paragraphs, in the same way as paragraphs 104 to 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment, which are worded in very similar terms, develop different aspects of the General Court’s single line of reasoning justifying its decision — given in paragraph 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 119 of the Ryanair judgment — that the Commission had committed ‘an error of assessment and an error of law’ by setting the amount of aid to be recovered from the airlines at EUR 8 per passenger.",prem,"['which be word term', 'paragraph develop aspect', ' justify decision', ' give paragraph', 'commission have mitte error', ' set amount', ' set 8', ' to be recover airline']"
Those different aspects of the reasoning are interlinked and Ryanair’s separation of them into three allegedly separate grounds is artificial and fails to have regard to their internal cohesion.,prem,"['aspect be interlink ', 'separation fail ', ' to have regard']"
"Furthermore, the arguments relied on by the Commission call into question the General Court’s entire line of reasoning, not simply a part of that reasoning, as claimed by Ryanair.",prem,"[' rely commission', 'argument call line', 'argument call question', ' number part', ' claim ryanair']"
"That said, as regards the analysis of the substance of the Commission’s single ground of appeal, it should be noted, first, that the obligation on the Member State concerned to abolish, through recovery, aid considered by the Commission to be incompatible with the single market has as its purpose, according to the Court’s established case-law, to restore the situation as it was before the aid was granted (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 April 1995, Commission v Italy, C‑350/93, EU:C:1995:96, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['that say ', ' regard analysis', ' to abolish company', ' to abolish recovery', ' sidere commission', 'obligation have purpose', ' accord law', ' to restore situation', 'aid be grant ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"That objective is attained once the aid in question, together, where appropriate, with default interest, has been repaid by the recipient, or, in other words, by the undertakings which actually enjoyed the benefit of it.",prem,"['objective be attain ', 'aid have be repay recipient', 'which enjoy benefit']"
"By repaying the aid, the recipient forfeits the advantage which it had enjoyed over its competitors on the market, and the situation prior to payment of the aid is restored (judgment of 29 April 2004, Germany v Commission, C‑277/00, EU:C:2004:238, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' repay aid', 'recipient forfeit advantage', 'it have enjoy petitor', 'it have enjoy market', 'situation be restore judgment']"
"Second, the recovery of unlawful aid with a view to re-establishing the status quo ante does not imply reconstructing past events differently on the basis of hypothetical elements such as the choices, often numerous, which could have been made by the operators concerned, since the choices actually made with the aid might prove to be irreversible (judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraph 118).",prem,"[' establish ante', 'recovery do imply ', ' reconstruct event', ' reconstruct basis', ' have be make operator', ' make aid', 'choice might prove ']"
"It follows, as the Advocate General observed, in essence, in point 62 of his Opinion, that recovery of such aid entails the restitution of the advantage procured by the aid for the recipient, not the restitution of any economic benefit the recipient may have enjoyed as a result of exploiting the advantage.",prem,"['it follow ', 'general observe essence', 'general observe point', 'recovery entail restitution', ' procure aid', 'recipient may have enjoy result', ' exploit advantage']"
"That benefit may not be the same as the advantage constituting the aid and there may indeed be no such benefit, but that cannot justify any failure to recover that aid or the recovery of a different sum from that constituting the advantage procured by the unlawful aid in question.",prem,"[' stitute aid', 'that can not justify failure', ' to recover aid', ' stitute advantage', ' procure aid']"
"With regard, in particular, to unlawful aid granted in the form of a tax advantage, it is also the Court’s settled case-law that recovery of aid means that the transactions actually carried out by the recipients of the aid in question must be subject to the tax treatment which the recipients would have received in the absence of the unlawful aid (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraph 119).",prem,"[' grant form', 'recovery mean ', ' carry recipient', 'recipient would have receive absence', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"In the present cases, the tax advantage conferred by ATT consisted, according to the decision at issue, in the application during the period in question of different tax rates, which had the effect of conferring a benefit on airlines in Ireland that had to pay the EUR 2 tax rate by comparison with other airlines that had to pay EUR 10 per passenger during the same period.",prem,"['company ferre company', 'advantage siste application', 'advantage siste period', ' accord decision', 'which have effect', 'company ferre benefit', 'company ferre airline', 'that have ', ' to pay rate', ' to pay parison', ' to pay airline', 'that have ', ' to pay 10', ' to pay period']"
"Aer Lingus and Ryanair have failed to demonstrate that, in so far as it establishes the existence of State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, that decision is vitiated by unlawfulness.",prem,"['lingus have fail ', 'it establish existence', 'it establish meaning', 'decision be vitiate unlawfulness']"
"In those circumstances, in the light of the considerations set out in paragraphs 89 to 93 above, it must be concluded that restitution of the advantage procured by the aid measure, as identified by the decision at issue, required the Irish tax authorities to recover from the beneficiaries of the lower rate of ATT the difference between the amount of ATT which, in the absence of unlawful aid, should have been paid in respect of each of the flights in question, namely the amount of ATT at the higher rate, and the amount of ATT actually paid — in other words, the amount calculated on the basis of the lower rate of ATT.",prem,"[' set paragraph', 'it must be clude ', ' procure measure', ' identify decision', 'restitution require authority', ' to recover difference', ' to recover beneficiary', 'which should have be pay respect', ' pay word', ' calculate basis']"
"Accordingly, it must be found that, in the present cases, repayment of the aid called for the recovery of a sum of EUR 8 per passenger for each of the flights concerned, as the Commission stated in Article 4 of the decision at issue.",prem,"['it must be find ', 'repayment call recovery', 'company cerne ', 'commission state article']"
"The considerations set out in paragraphs 104 to 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraphs 120 to 149 of the Ryanair judgment cannot justify, contrary to the view reached by the General Court, any different conclusion.",prem,"[' set paragraph', 'sideration can not justify clusion', ' reach court']"
"In so far as, under the applicable Irish legislation, airlines were directly liable for ATT, it is of little consequence, in the circumstances of the present cases, that that tax was classified under Irish law as ‘excise duty’.",prem,"['tax be classify law', 'tax be classify duty']"
"For the same reason, the question whether, from a technical point of view, ATT is to be classified as a direct or indirect tax is irrelevant.",prem,[' to be classify tax']
"Equally irrelevant, as regards the question of the recovery of the aid, is the notion of ‘economic passing on’ referred to in paragraph 91 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 123 of the Ryanair judgment, respectively.",prem,"[' regard question', ' refer paragraph']"
"The General Court stated in that connection, as regards flights subject to the lower rate of EUR 2 per passenger, that for the purpose of assessing the ‘economic passing on’, it was necessary to determine to what extent the airlines concerned actually retained the economic advantage arising from the application of the lower rate.",prem,"['court state nection', ' regard flight', ' assess passing', 'company retain advantage', ' arise application']"
"As is apparent from paragraphs 92 and 93 above, the recovery of aid entails the restitution of the advantage procured by the aid for the beneficiary, not the restitution of the economic benefit that may have been conferred by the aid as a result of the exploitation of the advantage.",prem,"['recovery entail restitution', ' procure aid', 'that may have be ferre aid', 'that may have be ferre result']"
There is therefore no need to examine whether and to what extent those airlines actually utilised the economic advantage arising from the application of the lower rate.,prem,"['there be need', 'airline utilise advantage', ' arise application']"
The considerations of the General Court set out in paragraphs 92 to 105 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraphs 124 to 136 of the Ryanair judgment disclose the same confusion between the advantage obtained as a result of the effect of the lower rate of ATT and the benefit which the aid recipients derived or could have derived from that advantage.,prem,"[' set paragraph', 'sideration disclose fusion', ' obtain result', 'recipient derive ', 'recipient have derive advantage']"
"Indeed, contrary to the view expressed by the General Court in paragraph 105 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 136 of the Ryanair judgment, the advantage, as identified by the Commission in the decision at issue, did not consist in the fact that the airlines subject to the lower rate were able to ‘offer more competitive prices’.",prem,"[' express court', ' express paragraph', ' identify commission', ' identify decision', 'advantage do number sist', 'advantage do number fact', ' to offer price']"
"It consisted, quite simply, in the fact that those companies had to pay a lower rate of ATT than they would have had to pay if their flights had been subject to the higher rate of ATT.",prem,"['it siste fact', ' to pay rate', 'they would have have ']"
"The question whether that advantage enabled them to offer more competitive ticket prices, or whether they exploited that advantage differently, relates to the assessment of any benefit they were able to accrue from the exploitation of the advantage granted;",prem,"['advantage enable they', ' to offer price', 'they exploit advantage', 'question relate assessment', ' to accrue exploitation']"
that assessment is irrelevant to the recovery of the aid.,prem,[]
"The General Court was also incorrect in stating, in paragraph 110 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 141 of the Ryanair judgment, respectively, that the circumstances of the cases before it were different from those of the case giving rise to the judgment of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano (C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774) as the airlines benefiting from the lower rate of ATT ‘could not have opted for an operation other than that which was coupled with the aid’.",prem,"[' state paragraph', ' give rise', ' give judgment', ' benefit rate', 'airline have opt operation', ' plead aid']"
"As the General Court acknowledged, in essence, in paragraph 111 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 142 of the Ryanair judgment, there was nothing to prevent those airlines from increasing by EUR 8 the ticket price, excluding tax, of flights subject to the lower rate of ATT.",prem,"['court acknowledge essence', 'court acknowledge paragraph', 'there be hing', ' to prevent airline', ' increase price', ' exclude tax']"
"The fact that, pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008, they could add to the ticket price, excluding tax, only EUR 2, corresponding to ATT calculated at the reduced rate, does not lead to any different conclusion, as the amount corresponding to the difference between the two rates of ATT, namely EUR 8, could have been included previously in the price of the ticket, excluding tax.",prem,"[' add 2', ' add price', ' add tax', ' exclude tax', ' respond att', ' calculate rate', 'fact lead clusion', ' respond difference', 'amount have be include price', 'amount have be include tax', ' exclude tax']"
The considerations set out above are not called into question by Ryanair’s argument based on Article 13 of Directive 2014/104.,prem,"[' call question', ' call argument', ' base article']"
"As is apparent from the Court’s case-law cited in paragraphs 89 and 90 above, the recovery of unlawful aid had a different purpose from that of Directive 2014/104.",prem,"[' cite paragraph', 'recovery have purpose']"
"In particular, that directive, as is made clear in recitals 3 and 4 thereof, seeks to ensure that any person who considers that he has been adversely affected by an infringement of the competition rules laid down in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU may effectively exercise his right to claim compensation for the harm which he believes he has suffered.",prem,"[' be make clear', 'directive seek ', 'who sider ', 'he have be affect infringement', ' lay tfeu', 'person may exercise right', ' to claim pensation', 'he believe ', 'he have suffer ']"
"On the other hand, the purpose of aid recovery is not to seek compensation for individual harm of any kind, but to re-establish, on the market in question, the situation as it was before the aid was granted.",prem,"[' to seek pensation', ' establish situation', ' establish market', 'aid be grant ']"
"It is apparent from all the foregoing considerations that, by finding, in paragraph 123 of the Aer Lingus judgment and paragraph 119 of the Ryanair judgment, respectively, that the Commission had committed ‘an error of assessment and an error of law’, by setting the amount of aid to be recovered from the beneficiaries of the lower rate of ATT at EUR 8 per passenger in respect of the flights to which that rate applied, the General Court’s decision was vitiated by an error of law.",prem,"[' find paragraph', 'commission have mitte error', ' set amount', ' set 8', ' set respect', ' to be recover beneficiary', 'rate apply ', 'decision be vitiate error']"
It follows that paragraphs 74 to 76 of the Ryanair judgment are not vitiated by the error of law alleged by Ryanair and that the first part of its single ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,"['it follow ', 'paragraph be vitiate error', ' allege ryanair', 'part must be reject ']"
"Accordingly, the fourth part of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal must also be rejected.",conc,['part must be reject ']
"In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the second, third and fourth parts of Aer Lingus’s single ground of appeal and the second and third parts of Ryanair’s single ground of appeal must be rejected and, accordingly, the cross-appeals dismissed in their entirety as unfounded.",conc,"['part must be reject ', 'cros dismiss entirety', '- dismiss entirety', 'appeal dismiss entirety']"
"As a consequence, the Commission’s appeals must be upheld and paragraph 1 of the operative part of the Aer Lingus judgment and of the Ryanair judgment must be set aside.",conc,"['appeal must be uphold ', 'paragraph must be set ']"
