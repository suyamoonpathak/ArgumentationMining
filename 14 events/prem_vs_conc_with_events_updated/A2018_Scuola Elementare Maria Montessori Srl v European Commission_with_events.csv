"In the first place, it should be recalled that by the Treaty of Lisbon a third limb was added to the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, relaxing the conditions of admissibility of actions for annulment brought by natural and legal persons.",prem,"['it should be recall ', 'limb be add paragraph', ' relax dition', ' bring person']"
"That limb, without subjecting the admissibility of actions for annulment brought by natural and legal persons to the condition of individual concern, allows such actions to be brought against ‘regulatory acts’ which do not entail implementing measures and are of direct concern to the applicant (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 57).",prem,"[' subject admissibility', ' subject dition', ' bring person', 'limb allow ', 'action to be bring act', 'which do entail ', ' implement measure', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"As regards the concept of ‘regulatory acts’, the Court has held that its scope is more restricted than that of the concept of ‘acts’ used in the first and second limbs of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU and refers to acts of acts of general application other than legislative acts (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraphs 58 to 61).",prem,"[' regard cept', 'court have hold ', ' use limb', 'court refer judgment', 'court refer act', ' see effect']"
"As the Advocate General observes in point 26 of his Opinion, the interpretation supported by the Commission, namely that there are non-legislative acts of general application, such as the decision at issue, that are not covered by the concept of ‘regulatory act’ within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, cannot be accepted.",prem,"['general observe point', ' support commission', 'there be act', 'interpretation can be not accept ']"
"There is no basis for that interpretation in the wording, origin or purpose of that provision.",prem,"['there be basis', 'there be wording']"
"As regards, first, the wording of the provision, it refers to ‘regulatory acts’ generally and contains no indication that that reference is only to certain kinds or subcategories of those acts.",prem,"[' regard wording', 'it refer act']"
"As regards, next, the origin of the provision, it appears from the legislative history of Article III‑365(4) of the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the content of which was repeated in the same words in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, that the addition of the third limb to that provision was intended to broaden the conditions of admissibility of actions for annulment with respect to natural and legal persons, and the only acts of general application for which a restrictive approach was to be maintained were legislative acts (see, in particular, Secretariat of the European Convention, Final report of the discussion circle on the Court of Justice, 25 March 2003 (CONV 636/03, point 22), and Cover note from the Praesidium to the Convention, 12 May 2003 (CONV 734/03, p. 20)).",prem,"[' regard origin', 'it appear history', ' establish constitution', 'tent be repeat word', 'addition be intend ', ' to broaden dition', ' see secretariat']"
"As regards, finally, the purpose of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, as may be seen from paragraphs 22, 23 and 26 above, its objective is to relax the conditions of admissibility of actions for annulment brought by natural and legal persons against all acts of general application, with the exception of those of a legislative nature.",prem,"[' regard purpose', ' may be see paragraph', ' to relax dition', ' to relax act', ' bring person']"
To remove certain kinds or subcategories of non-legislative acts of general application from the scope of that provision would run counter to that objective.,prem,"[' to remove kind', ' to remove scope', 'remove would run nter', 'remove would run objective']"
"Consequently, it must be considered that the concept of ‘regulatory act’ within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU extends to all non-legislative acts of general application.",prem,"['it must be sidere ', 'cept extend act']"
"Since the decision at issue is not a legislative act, the General Court did not err in law by confining itself, for the purpose of examining the regulatory nature of the three parts of that decision, to assessing whether those parts are of general application.",prem,"['court do number', 'court do err', 'court do law', 'court do purpose', 'company fine itself', ' examine nature']"
"In the second place, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an act is of general application if it applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects with respect to categories of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (judgments of 11 July 1968, Zuckerfabrik Watenstedt v Council, 6/68, EU:C:1968:43, p. 415; of 15 January 2002, Libéros v Commission, C‑171/00 P, EU:C:2002:17, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited; and of 17 March 2011, AJD Tuna, C‑221/09, EU:C:2011:153, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it should be recall ', ' accord law', 'it apply situation', 'it produce effect', ' envisage manner', ' envisage judgment']"
"Article 1(d) of Regulation No 659/1999 defines ‘aid scheme’ as ‘any act on the basis of which, without further implementing measures being required, individual aid awards may be made to undertakings defined within the act in a general and abstract manner and any act on the basis of which aid which is not linked to a specific project may be awarded to one or several undertakings for an indefinite period of time and/or for an indefinite amount’.",prem,"['article define scheme', 'article define act', 'award may be make ', ' define act', ' define manner', 'which be link project', ' may be award period']"
"As regards the second limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, the Court has repeatedly held in the field of State aid that decisions of the Commission authorising or prohibiting a national scheme are of general application.",prem,"[' regard limb', 'court have hold field', 'commission authorise ', 'commission prohibit scheme']"
"That general application derives from the fact that such decisions apply to objectively determined situations and produce legal effects with respect to a category of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 December 2008, British Aggregates v Commission, C‑487/06 P, EU:C:2008:757, paragraph 31; of 17 September 2009, Commission v Koninglijke Friesland/Campina, C‑519/07 P, EU:C:2009:556, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited; and of 28 June 2018, Lowell Financial Services v Commission, C‑219/16 P, not published, EU:C:2018:508, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['application derive fact', 'decision apply situation', 'decision produce effect', ' envisage manner', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"As the Advocate General observes in points 48 and 49 of his Opinion, that case-law may be applied to the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.",prem,"['general observe point', 'law may be apply limb']"
The issue of whether or not an act is of general application concerns an objective characteristic of the act which cannot vary according to the different limbs of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.,prem,"['which can not vary ', ' accord limb']"
"Moreover, an interpretation according to which an act could at the same time be of general application in relation to the second limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU and not be of general application in relation to the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU would run counter to the objective behind the addition of that provision, which was to relax the conditions of admissibility for annulment actions brought by natural or legal persons.",prem,"[' accord which', 'company ld ', 'interpretation would run nter', 'interpretation would run objective', ' to relax dition', ' bring person']"
"Consequently, the General Court did not err in law in considering that the second and third parts of the decision at issue are of general application.",prem,"['court do number', 'court do sidering']"
"In the third place, as regards the first part of the decision at issue, it is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, a recovery order is of individual concern to the beneficiaries of the aid scheme in question, in that, once such an order is adopted, they are exposed to the risk that the benefits they have received will be recovered and are therefore members of a restricted class (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraphs 33 to 35; of 29 April 2004, Italy v Commission, C‑298/00 P, EU:C:2004:240, paragraph 39; and of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 56).",prem,"[' regard part', ' accord law', 'order be adopt ', 'they be expose risk', 'they have receive ', 'benefit will be recover ', ' see effect']"
"However, contrary to the Commission’s arguments, it cannot be deduced from that case-law that the first part of the decision at issue is not of general application and is therefore not regulatory.",prem,['it can be not deduce law']
It follows from that case-law that the fact that that part is of individual concern to the restricted class of beneficiaries of the aid scheme concerned does not preclude that part from being regarded as of general application where it applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects for categories of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner.,prem,"['it follow law', 'fact do preclude part', 'it apply situation', 'it produce effect', ' envisage manner']"
That is so in the present case.,prem,[]
"Since the Commission considered, in the first part of the decision at issue, that it was not appropriate to order the recovery of the aid granted by virtue of the exemption from ICI despite its being unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, that decision preserves the anticompetitive effects of the general and abstract measure which that exemption constitutes with respect to an indefinite number of competitors of the beneficiaries of the aid granted under that measure.",prem,"['company sidere part', ' to order recovery', ' grant virtue', 'decision preserve effect', 'company stitute respect', ' grant measure']"
The decision therefore applies to objectively determined situations and produces legal effects for categories of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner.,prem,"['decision apply situation', 'decision produce effect', 'decision produce category', ' envisage manner']"
It follows that the General Court was entitled to consider that the first part of the decision at issue is of general application.,prem,"['it follow ', 'court be entitle sider']"
"According to settled case-law of the Court, the condition that a natural or legal person must be directly concerned by the decision against which the action is brought, laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, requires two cumulative criteria to be met, namely, first, the contested measure must directly affect the legal situation of the individual and, second, it must leave no discretion to its addressees who are entrusted with the task of implementing it, such implementation being purely automatic and resulting from the EU rules alone without the application of other intermediate rules (judgments of 5 May 1998, Glencore Grain v Commission, C‑404/96 P, EU:C:1998:196, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited; of 13 October 2011, Deutsche Post and Germany v Commission, C‑463/10 P and C‑475/10 P, EU:C:2011:656, paragraph 66; and order of 19 July 2017, Lysoform Dr. Hans Rosemann and Ecolab Deutschland v ECHA, C‑666/16 P, not published, EU:C:2017:569, paragraph 42).",prem,"[' accord law', 'person must be cerne decision', 'action be bring ', ' lay paragraph', 'dition require criterion', 'measure must affect situation', 'it must leave discretion', 'it must leave addressee', 'who be entrust task', ' implement it', 'implementation result rule', ' cite october']"
"As regards specifically the rules on State aid, it must be noted that their objective is to preserve competition (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 June 2006, Air Liquide Industries Belgium, C‑393/04 and C‑41/05, EU:C:2006:403, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited, and of 17 July 2008, Essent Network Noord and Others, C‑206/06, EU:C:2008:413, paragraph 60).",prem,"[' regard rule', ' to preserve petition', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"So, in that field, the fact that a Commission decision leaves intact all the effects of the national measures which the applicant, in a complaint addressed to that institution, claimed were not compatible with that objective and placed it in an unfavourable competitive position makes it possible to conclude that the decision directly affects its legal situation, in particular its right under the provisions on State aid of the FEU Treaty not to be subject to competition distorted by the national measures concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 January 1986, Cofaz and Others v Commission, 169/84, EU:C:1986:42, paragraph 30).",prem,"['decision leave intact', 'decision leave effect', ' address institution', 'applicant claim ', 'which place it', 'which place position', 'fact make ', 'decision affect situation', ' distort measure', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"In the present case, with respect to the first of the two criteria mentioned in paragraph 42 above, the General Court considered in substance, in paragraph 42 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), and paragraph 45 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Ferracci v Commission (T‑219/13, EU:T:2016:485), that it was satisfied because the services offered by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori respectively were similar to those offered by the beneficiaries of the national measures assessed in the decision at issue and, consequently, the former ‘might be in a competitive relationship’ with the latter.",prem,"[' mention paragraph', 'company sidere substance', 'company sidere paragraph', ' offer ferracci', ' offer beneficiary', ' assess decision']"
"As the Commission rightly submits, that reasoning is vitiated by an error of law.",prem,"['commission submit ', 'reasoning be vitiate error']"
"While it is not for the EU judicature, at the stage of the examination of admissibility, to rule definitively on the competitive relationships between an applicant and the beneficiaries of the national measures assessed in a decision of the Commission on State aid, such as the decision at issue (see, to that effect, judgments of 28 January 1986, Cofaz and Others v Commission, 169/84, EU:C:1986:42, paragraph 28, and of 20 December 2017, Binca Seafoods v Commission, C‑268/16 P, EU:C:2017:1001, paragraph 59), a direct effect on such an applicant cannot be deduced from the mere potential existence of a competitive relationship, such as that found in the judgments under appeal.",prem,"['judicature to rule relationship', 'judicature to rule effect', ' assess decision', 'effect can be not deduce existence', ' find judgment']"
"Given that the condition of direct concern requires the contested measure to produce effects directly on the applicant’s legal situation, the EU judicature must ascertain whether the applicant has adequately explained the reasons why the Commission’s decision is liable to place him in an unfavourable competitive position and thus to produce effects on his legal situation.",prem,"['dition require measure', ' to produce effect', ' to produce situation', 'judicature must ascertain ', 'applicant have explain reason', ' to place he', ' to place position', ' to produce effect']"
"It must nonetheless be recalled that, if the grounds of a decision of the General Court reveal an infringement of EU law but the operative part of the judgment can be seen to be well founded on other legal grounds, that infringement is not capable of leading to the annulment of that decision and a substitution of grounds must be made (judgment of 26 July 2017, Council v LTTE, C‑599/14 P, EU:C:2017:583, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it must be recall ', 'ground reveal infringement', 'part can be see ', ' found ground', ' lead annulment', 'substitution must be make ']"
That is the case here.,prem,[]
"It may be seen from the applications brought by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori before the General Court that they submitted, with evidence in support and without being contradicted by the Commission on this point, that their establishments were situated in the immediate vicinity of ecclesiastical or religious entities carrying on similar activities to theirs which were thus active in the same market for services and the same geographical market.",prem,"['it may be see application', ' bring ferracci', ' bring court', 'they submit evidence', ' be tradicte commission', ' be tradicte point', 'establishment be situate vicinity', ' carry activity']"
"In so far as such entities were a priori eligible for the national measures assessed in the decision at issue, it must be considered that Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori have adequately explained the reasons why the decision at issue was liable to place them in an unfavourable competitive position and, consequently, that that decision directly affected their legal situation, in particular their right not to be subject in that market to competition distorted by the measures in question.",prem,"[' assess decision', 'it must be sidere ', 'ferracci have explain reason', ' to place they', ' to place position', 'decision affect situation', 'decision affect number', ' distort measure']"
"Contrary to the arguments of the Commission, that conclusion is not called into question by the judgments of 28 April 2015, TL Sugars and Sidul Açúcares v Commission (C‑456/13 P, EU:C:2015:284), and of 17 September 2015, Confederazione Cooperative Italiane and Others v Anicav and Others (C‑455/13 P, C‑457/13 P and C‑460/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:616).",prem,"[' call question', ' call judgment']"
"While the Court held in those judgments that the mere fact that provisions adopted as part of the common agricultural policy place an applicant in an unfavourable competitive position does not in itself allow it to be concluded that those provisions affect the applicant’s legal situation, that line of case-law cannot be transposed to actions brought by competitors of beneficiaries of State aid.",prem,"['court hold judgment', ' adopt part', 'provision place applicant', 'provision place position', 'it to be clude ', 'provision affect situation', 'line can be not transpose action', ' bring petitor']"
"The cases cited in the preceding paragraph did not concern the rules on State aid, the objective of which is precisely to preserve competition, as noted in paragraph 43 above.",prem,"[' cite paragraph', ' to preserve petition']"
"Consequently, the actions brought by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori satisfy the first of the two criteria mentioned in paragraph 42 above.",prem,"[' bring ferracci', 'action satisfy first', ' mention paragraph']"
"With respect to the second of those criteria, the General Court considered in paragraph 45 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), and paragraph 48 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Ferracci v Commission (T‑219/13, EU:T:2016:485), that the decision at issue, both in its first part and in its second and third parts, produces legal effects purely automatically on the basis of the EU rules alone without the application of other intermediate rules.",prem,"['company sidere paragraph', 'decision produce effect', 'decision produce basis', 'decision produce application']"
"As the Advocate General observes in substance in point 52 of his Opinion, that consideration, which is not contested by the Commission in these appeals, is not vitiated by any error of law.",prem,"['general observe substance', 'general observe point', ' test commission', ' test appeal', 'sideration be vitiate error']"
It follows that the General Court was entitled to consider that Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori were directly concerned by the decision at issue.,prem,"['it follow ', 'court be entitle sider', ' cerne decision']"
"According to settled case-law of the Court, the expression ‘does not entail implementing measures’ within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU must be interpreted in the light of the objective of that provision, which, as is apparent from its drafting history, is to ensure that individuals do not have to break the law in order to have access to a court.",prem,"[' accord law', 'expression do entail ', ' implement measure', ' implement meaning', ' must be interpret light', 'individual do have ', ' to break law', ' to have access']"
"Where a regulatory act directly affects the legal situation of a natural or legal person without requiring implementing measures, that person could be denied effective judicial protection if he did not have a legal remedy before the EU judicature for the purpose of challenging the lawfulness of the regulatory act.",prem,"['act affect situation', ' require measure', 'company be deny protection', 'he do have remedy', 'he do have judicature', 'he do have purpose', ' challenge lawfulness']"
"In the absence of implementing measures, a natural or legal person, although directly concerned by the act in question, would be able to obtain judicial review of the act only after having infringed its provisions, by pleading that those provisions are unlawful in proceedings initiated against them before the national court (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 27, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' cerne act', ' to obtain review', ' having infringe provision', ' initiate they', ' initiate judgment']"
"By contrast, where a regulatory act entails implementing measures, judicial review of compliance with the EU legal order is ensured irrespective of whether those measures were adopted by the European Union or the Member States.",prem,"['act entail ', ' implement measure', 'review be ensure ', 'measure be adopt union']"
"Natural or legal persons who are unable, because of the conditions of admissibility in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, to challenge an EU regulatory act directly before the EU judicature are protected against the application to them of such an act by the ability to challenge the implementing measures which the act entails (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 28, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' to challenge act', 'person be protect application', 'person be protect ability', ' to challenge measure', 'act entail judgment']"
"Where responsibility for the implementation of such acts lies with the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the European Union, natural or legal persons are entitled to bring a direct action before the EU judicature against the implementing acts under the conditions stated in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, and to plead in support of that action, pursuant to Article 277 TFEU, the unlawfulness of the basic act concerned.",prem,"['responsibility lie institution', 'person be entitle ', ' to bring action', ' to bring judicature', ' state paragraph', ' to plead unlawfulness', ' to plead support']"
"Where that implementation is a matter for the Member States, those persons may plead the invalidity of the basic act concerned before the national courts and cause them to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 TFEU (judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 29, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['person may plead invalidity', 'person cause ', 'they to refer question', 'they to refer court', 'they to refer ruling', 'they to refer judgment', 'law cite ']"
"The Court has, moreover, repeatedly held that the question whether a regulatory act entails implementing measures should be assessed by reference to the position of the person pleading the right to bring proceedings under the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.",prem,"['court have hold ', 'act entail ', ' implement measure', 'question should be assess reference', ' plead right', ' to bring proceeding', ' to bring limb']"
It is therefore irrelevant whether the act in question entails implementing measures with regard to other persons.,prem,"['act entail ', ' implement measure']"
"Furthermore, in that assessment, reference should be made exclusively to the subject matter of the action (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraphs 30 and 31; of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraphs 50 and 51; and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraphs 38 and 39 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['reference should be make matter', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"In the present case, in so far as the actions brought by Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori sought the annulment of the first part of the decision at issue, it must be considered, as the Advocate General observes in point 69 of his Opinion, that, the materialisation of the legal effects of the decision not to order recovery of the aid found to be unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, which was the subject of that first part, did not need any implementing measures which could be the subject of judicial review by the EU judicature or the national courts.",prem,"[' bring ferracci', 'action seek annulment', 'general observe point', ' to order recovery', 'number do need measure']"
The General Court was therefore entitled to conclude that that part does not entail implementing measures within the meaning of the third limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU with respect to Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori.,prem,"['court be entitle ', 'part do entail ', ' implement measure', ' implement meaning', ' implement respect']"
Nor indeed does the Commission put forward any specific argument to challenge that conclusion.,prem,"['commission do put argument', ' to challenge clusion']"
"As regards the second and third parts of the decision at issue, in which the Commission found that Article 149(4) of the TUIR and the exemption under the IMU scheme did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, it must be recalled that the Court has indeed repeatedly held that, for the beneficiaries of an aid scheme, the national provisions establishing the scheme and the measures implementing those provisions, such as a tax notice, constitute implementing measures entailed by a decision declaring the aid scheme incompatible with the internal market or declaring it compatible with the internal market subject to compliance with commitments entered into by the Member State concerned (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraphs 35 and 36; of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraphs 52 and 53; and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonlinie and Others v Commission, C‑133/12 P, EU:C:2014:105, paragraphs 39 and 40).",prem,"[' regard part', 'commission find ', 'article do number stitute', 'article do number meaning', 'it must be recall ', 'court have hold judgment', ' establish scheme', ' implement provision', 'company stitute ', ' implement measure', ' entail decision', ' enter company', ' see effect']"
"That case-law reflects the fact that a beneficiary of an aid scheme can, where he satisfies the conditions under national law for being eligible for that scheme, request the national authorities to grant him the aid as it would have been granted if there were an unconditional decision declaring the scheme compatible with the internal market, and contest before the national courts a measure refusing that request, pleading the invalidity of the Commission’s decision declaring the scheme incompatible with the internal market or compatible with that market subject to compliance with commitments entered into by the Member State concerned, in order to cause those courts to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling on its validity (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraphs 36 and 59, and order of 15 January 2015, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Telefónica v Commission, C‑587/13 P and C‑588/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:18, paragraphs 49 and 65).",prem,"['law reflect fact', 'he satisfy dition', 'he satisfy law', 'beneficiary can request authority', ' to grant aid', 'it would have be grant ', 'there be decision', 'company rt measure', ' refuse request', ' plead invalidity', ' enter company', 'rt to refer question', 'rt to refer court', 'rt to refer ruling', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"However, that case-law cannot be applied to the situation of the competitors of beneficiaries of a national measure that has been found not to constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, such as Mr Ferracci and Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori.",prem,"['law can be not apply situation', 'law can be not apply ferracci', 'that have be find ']"
"The situation of such a competitor differs from that of the beneficiaries of aid referred to by that case-law, in that the competitor does not satisfy the conditions laid down by the national measure in question for eligibility for that aid.",prem,"['situation differ that', ' refer law', 'petitor do satisfy dition', ' lay measure']"
"In those circumstances, as the Advocate General observes in point 71 of his Opinion, it would be artificial to require that competitor to request the national authorities to grant him that benefit and to contest the refusal of that request before a national court, in order to cause the national court to make a reference to the Court on the validity of the Commission’s decision concerning that measure.",prem,"['general observe point', ' to require petitor', ' to request authority', ' to grant benefit', ' to test refusal', ' to test rt', 'rt to make reference', ' cerne measure']"
"The General Court was therefore entitled to find that the decision at issue did not, either in its first or in its second and third parts, comprise implementing measures with respect to Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori and Mr Ferracci.",prem,"['court be entitle ', 'decision do number first', ' implement measure']"
"As regards the first part of the first ground of appeal, it must be recalled that in accordance with the first sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, where negative decisions are taken in cases of unlawful aid, the Commission is to decide that the Member State concerned shall take all necessary measures to recover the aid from the beneficiary.",prem,"[' regard part', 'it must be recall ', 'decision be take case', 'company shall take measure', ' to recover aid', ' to recover beneficiary']"
It is settled case-law that the adoption of an order to recover unlawful aid is the logical and normal consequence of a finding that it is unlawful.,prem,[' to recover aid']
"The principal objective of such an order is to eliminate the distortion of competition caused by the competitive advantage conferred by the unlawful aid (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 December 2005, Unicredito Italiano, C‑148/04, EU:C:2005:774, paragraph 113 and the case-law cited; of 1 October 2015, Electrabel and Dunamenti Erőmű v Commission, C‑357/14 P, EU:C:2015:642, paragraph 111 and the case-law cited; and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Aer Lingus and Ryanair Designated Activity, C‑164/15 P and C‑165/15 P, EU:C:2016:990, paragraph 116).",prem,"[' to eliminate distortion', ' to eliminate judgment', ' cause company', ' ferre aid']"
"However, in accordance with the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, the Commission shall not require the recovery of the aid if this would be contrary to a general principle of EU law.",prem,['commission shall require recovery']
"As the Advocate General observes in points 107 and 110 of his Opinion, the principle that ‘no one is obliged to do the impossible’ is among the general principles of EU law (see, to that effect, order of 3 March 2016, Daimler, C‑179/15, EU:C:2016:134, paragraph 42).",prem,"['general observe point', 'number be oblige ', ' to do impossible', ' see order', ' see effect']"
"While it follows from settled case-law of the Court that the only defence that may be relied on by a Member State against an action for failure to fulfil obligations brought by the Commission on the basis of Article 108(2) TFEU is the absolute impossibility of implementing correctly the Commission’s decision to order recovery of the aid in question (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 January 1986, Commission v Belgium, 52/84, EU:C:1986:3, paragraph 14; of 1 June 2006, Commission v Italy, C‑207/05, not published, EU:C:2006:366, paragraph 45; and of 9 November 2017, Commission v Greece, C‑481/16, not published, EU:C:2017:845, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited), that case-law relates, however, solely to the pleas that can be raised in defence by the Member State against an order for recovery made by the Commission, not to whether or not the absolute impossibility of recovering the aid may already be established at the stage of the formal investigation procedure.",prem,"['it follow law', 'that may be rely state', 'that may be rely action', ' to fulfil obligation', ' bring commission', ' bring basis', ' implement decision', ' to order recovery', ' see judgment', ' see effect', 'law relate plea', 'that can be raise defence', 'that can be raise state', 'that can be raise order', ' make commission', ' recover aid', 'impossibility may be establish stage']"
"Moreover, and above all, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s argument that the absolute impossibility of recovering unlawful aid can be established only after the adoption of an order for recovery conflicts with the very wording of the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, under which the Commission is not to adopt an order for recovery if that would be contrary to a general principle of EU law.",prem,"[' recover aid', 'impossibility can be establish adoption', 'argument flict wording', ' to adopt order']"
"The Court has previously held that the Commission cannot, on pain of its being invalid, adopt an order for recovery which, from the moment of its adoption, is objectively and absolutely impossible to implement (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 June 1999, Belgium v Commission, C‑75/97, EU:C:1999:311, paragraph 86).",prem,"['court have hold ', 'commission can not adopt order', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"In so far as Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori also bases the first part of its first ground of appeal on the principle of sincere cooperation, it must be recalled that under Article 4(3) TEU that principle applies throughout the procedure for the examination of a measure by reference to the provisions of EU law on State aid (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 147 and the case-law cited, and of 21 December 2016, Club Hotel Loutraki and Others v Commission, C‑131/15 P, EU:C:2016:989, paragraph 34).",prem,"['montessori base part', 'montessori base principle', 'it must be recall ', 'principle apply procedure', 'principle apply reference', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"Thus where, as in the present case, the Member State concerned already claims during the formal investigation procedure that recovery is absolutely impossible, the principle of sincere cooperation requires the Member State, at that stage, to submit to the Commission for assessment the reasons underlying that claim and requires the Commission to examine them scrupulously.",prem,"['company claim procedure', 'principle require state', 'principle require stage', ' to submit reason', ' to submit commission', ' to submit assessment', ' underlie claim', 'principle require commission', ' to examine they']"
"Consequently, contrary to Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s submission, that principle does not require the Commission to attach an order for recovery to every decision declaring aid to be unlawful and incompatible with the internal market, but requires it to take into consideration the arguments put to it by the Member State concerned on the existence of absolute impossibility of recovery.",prem,"['principle do require commission', ' to attach order', ' to attach decision', 'principle require it', ' to take argument', ' to take sideration', ' put it', ' put company', ' cerne existence']"
It follows that the first part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.,prem,"['it follow ', 'part must be reject ']"
"As regards the fourth part of this ground of appeal, it should be recalled that an appellant must, pursuant to Article 256 TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and demonstrate the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to that distortion.",prem,"[' regard part', 'it should be recall ', 'appellant must indicate evidence', ' to have be distort court', 'appellant demonstrate error', 'which lead distortion']"
"In addition, it is settled case-law of the Court that the distortion must be obvious from the documents in the case file without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (see, to that effect, judgments of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraphs 152 and 153, and of 8 March 2016, Greece v Commission, C‑431/14 P, EU:C:2016:145, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it be settle law', ' to carry assessment', 'evidence see judgment', 'evidence see effect']"
"In the present case, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori mentions only, in this fourth part, the Commission’s reply of 17 September 2015 to a question asked by the General Court as a measure of organisation of procedure, referred to in paragraph 100 of the judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), in which the Commission described the provisions of the Italian legislation on tax databases.",prem,"['montessori mention reply', 'montessori mention part', ' ask court', ' ask measure', ' refer paragraph', 'commission describe provision']"
"It must be stated, first, that Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori does not challenge in any way the presentation of the material content of that evidence in paragraphs 101 and 102 of that judgment, but confines itself to calling in question the assessment made by the General Court on the basis of that content.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'montessori do challenge presentation', 'montessori do challenge way', 'company fine itself', ' call assessment', ' call question', ' make court', ' make basis']"
"Second, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori has not shown in what way the General Court’s assessment that the Italian tax databases did not make it possible retroactively to trace the kind of activities carried on by entities enjoying the exemption from ICI for their real property, or to calculate the amount of the unlawfully obtained exemptions, appears manifestly erroneous.",prem,"['montessori have show ', 'assessment make ', ' to trace kind', ' carry entity', ' enjoy exemption', ' to calculate amount', ' appear erroneous']"
The fourth part of the first ground of appeal cannot therefore succeed.,prem,['part can not succeed ']
"As regards the second and third parts of this ground of appeal, which should be considered together, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court’s settled case-law on actions for failure to fulfil obligations brought on the ground of infringement of a decision ordering the recovery of unlawful aid, a Member State which encounters unforeseen and unforeseeable difficulties or becomes aware of consequences overlooked by the Commission must submit those problems to the Commission for consideration, together with proposals for suitable amendments to the decision at issue.",prem,"[' regard part', 'which should be sidere ', 'it must be recall ', ' to fulfil obligation', ' bring ground', ' order recovery', 'which encounter difficulty', 'which become ', ' overlook commission', 'state must submit problem', 'state must submit commission', 'state must submit sideration', 'state must submit proposal']"
"In such a case, the Member State and the Commission must, by virtue of the principle of sincere cooperation, work together in good faith with a view to overcoming difficulties while fully observing the provisions of the FEU Treaty, in particular those on aid (see, to that effect, judgments of 2 July 2002, Commission v Spain, C‑499/99, EU:C:2002:408, paragraph 24, and of 22 December 2010, Commission v Italy, C‑304/09, EU:C:2010:812, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['state must work faith', 'state must work view', ' overcome difficulty', ' observe provision', ' see effect']"
"However, the condition of absolute impossibility of implementation is not satisfied where the defendant Member State does no more than inform the Commission of the internal difficulties of a legal, political or practical nature, attributable to the national authorities’ own acts or omissions, raised by implementation of the decision at issue, without taking real steps to recover the aid from the undertakings concerned and without suggesting to the Commission alternative methods of implementing the decision which would allow those difficulties to be overcome (see, to that effect, judgments of 13 November 2008, Commission v France, C‑214/07, EU:C:2008:619, paragraph 50, and of 12 February 2015, Commission v France, C‑37/14, not published, EU:C:2015:90, paragraph 66 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' inform commission', ' inform difficulty', ' raise implementation', ' take step', ' to recover aid', ' to recover undertaking', ' suggest method', ' suggest commission', ' implement decision', 'which would allow ', 'difficulty to be overcome ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
That case-law is applicable mutatis mutandis to the assessment during the formal investigation procedure of whether it is absolutely impossible to recover unlawful aid.,prem,[' to recover aid']
"Thus a Member State which at that stage of the procedure encounters difficulties in recovering the aid concerned must submit those difficulties to the Commission for consideration and cooperate in good faith with the Commission with a view to overcoming them, in particular by suggesting alternative methods allowing recovery, if only in part, of the aid.",prem,"['which encounter difficulty', 'state must submit difficulty', 'state must submit commission', 'state must submit sideration', 'state must submit faith', 'state must submit commission', 'state must submit view', ' overcome they', ' suggest method', ' allow recovery']"

"In the present case, it follows from paragraphs 76 and 85 of the General Court’s judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), that the Commission confined itself, in the first part of the decision at issue, to deducing the absolute impossibility of recovering the unlawful aid in question solely from the fact that it was not possible to obtain the necessary information for recovery of the aid from the Italian land registry and tax databases, while omitting to consider the possible existence of alternative methods allowing recovery, if only in part, of the aid.",prem,"['it follow paragraph', 'company fine itself', 'company fine part', ' deduce impossibility', ' deduce fact', ' recover aid', ' to obtain information', ' to obtain registry', ' omit existence', ' omit sider', ' allow recovery']"
"By upholding the decision on this point, the General Court erred in law.",prem,"[' uphold decision', 'court err law']"
"As the Advocate General observes in points 116 and 117 of his Opinion, the circumstance that the information needed for recovery of the unlawful aid in question could not be obtained from the Italian land registry and tax databases must be regarded as caused by internal difficulties attributable to the national authorities’ own acts or omissions.",prem,"['general observe point', ' need recovery', 'information be obtain registry', 'circumstance must be regard ', ' cause difficulty']"

"As may be seen from paragraphs 90 to 92 above, recovery of unlawful aid may be considered to be objectively and absolutely impossible only if the Commission finds, following a detailed examination, that two cumulative conditions are satisfied, namely that the difficulties relied on by the Member State concerned are real and that there are no alternative methods of recovery.",prem,"[' may be see paragraph', 'recovery be sidere ', 'commission find examination', ' follow examination', ' rely company', 'there be method']"

"The error of law which thus vitiates the General Court’s judgment of 15 September 2016, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori v Commission (T‑220/13, not published, EU:T:2016:484), overlaps with that also committed by the General Court by rejecting, in paragraphs 86 and 104 to 110 of that judgment, Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori’s argument that the Commission should have examined the existence of alternative methods enabling recovery, if only in part, of the aid in question, on the ground that Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori had not been able to demonstrate their existence.",prem,"['which vitiate judgment', 'error overlap company', ' mitte court', ' reject argument', ' reject paragraph', 'commission should have examine existence', 'commission should have examine ground', ' enable recovery', ' to demonstrate existence']"
"In so far as Article 14(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 requires the Commission, as a general rule, to adopt an order to recover unlawful aid and allows it to refrain from doing so only exceptionally, it was for the Commission to show in the decision at issue that the conditions for it to decline to adopt such an order were satisfied, not for Scuola Elementare Maria Montessori to prove before the General Court that there existed alternative methods enabling recovery, if only in part, of the aid in question.",prem,"['article require commission', 'article require rule', ' to adopt order', ' to recover aid', 'article allow ', 'it to refrain ', 'commission to show decision', 'it to decline ', ' to adopt order', 'montessori to prove court', 'there exist method', ' enable recovery']"

"In this context, the concept of ‘undertaking’ covers any entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way in which it is financed (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 January 2006, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others, C‑222/04, EU:C:2006:8, paragraph 107, and of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraphs 39 and 41 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['entity engage activity', 'it be finance ', 'cept see judgment', 'cept see effect']"
