"It follows from the rules governing the procedure before the Courts of the European Union, in particular Article 21 of the Statute of the Court and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, that the dispute is in principle determined and circumscribed by the parties and that the Courts of the European Union may not rule ultra petita.",prem,"['it follow rule', ' govern procedure', 'dispute be determine ', 'dispute circumscribe party', 'courts may number ']"
"While certain pleas may, and indeed must, be raised by the courts of their own motion, such as the question whether a statement of reasons for the decision at issue is lacking or is inadequate, which falls within the scope of essential procedural requirements, a plea going to the substantive legality of that decision, which falls within the scope of infringement of the Treaties or of any rule of law relating to their application, within the meaning of Article 263 TFEU, can, by contrast, be examined by the Courts of the European Union only if it is raised by the applicant (see, to that effect, Case C-367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 67; Case C-265/97 P VBA v Florimex and Others [2000] ECR I-2061, paragraph 114; and Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 40).",prem,"['plea may must be raise rt', 'plea may must be raise motion', 'plea may must be raise question', 'which fall scope', ' go legality', 'which fall scope', ' relate application', 'plea can be examine courts', 'it be raise see', ' see effect']"
"Consequently, a plea based on an infringement of Article 87(1) EC because of the non‑attributability of the measure in question to the State cannot be raised by a court of its own motion.",prem,"[' base infringement', ' base attributability', 'plea can be not raise rt', 'plea can be not raise motion']"
"In this case, after stating in paragraphs 73 and 74 of the judgment under appeal that, before advantages can be classified as State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, they must, in particular, be attributable to the State, the General Court, in paragraphs 98 and 99 of the judgment under appeal, rejected the Commission’s arguments that the authorisation decisions could not, in any event, have the effect of relieving Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic of their obligation to comply with State aid rules and procedures and that the Council was not entitled, in exercising its own powers in the area of fiscal harmonisation, to encroach on the Commission’s powers in the area of State aid.",prem,"[' state paragraph', 'advantage can be classify aid', 'advantage can be classify meaning', 'court reject argument', 'decision have effect', ' relieve ireland', ' relieve obligation', ' to ply rule', ' exercise power', ' to encroach power']"
"The General Court held that the advantages which the exemptions at issue might have conferred on their beneficiaries had been granted in accordance with the authorisation decisions, and consequently they were attributable not to the Member States but to the European Union and, accordingly, the Commission was not entitled, even in the exercise of its almost exclusive powers under Articles 87 EC and 88 EC, to classify those exemptions as State aid.",prem,"['court hold ', 'exemption might have ferre beneficiary', 'advantage have be grant accordance', ' to classify exemption', ' to classify aid']"
"In paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court concluded that the authorisation decisions precluded the Commission being able to attribute the exemptions at issue to the Member States concerned and, therefore, being able to classify them as State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC and ordering their partial recovery to the extent that it regarded them as not compatible with the internal market, within the meaning of Article 87(3) EC.",prem,"['company clude ', 'decision preclude ', ' to attribute exemption', ' to attribute company', ' to classify they', ' to classify aid', ' to classify meaning', ' order recovery', ' order extent', 'it regard they', 'it regard company', 'it regard meaning']"
"Consequently, in paragraph 110 and in the operative part of the judgment under appeal, the General Court annulled the contested decision ‘in so far as it finds, or is based on the finding, that the exemptions [at issue] constituted State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC’ and in so far as it orders the recovery of those exemptions from their beneficiaries.",prem,"['court annul decision', 'it find ', 'it be base finding', 'exemption stitute aid', 'it order recovery']"
"By holding that the exemptions at issue were attributable to the European Union, the General Court, rather than raising a plea based on an infringement of essential procedural requirements, as suggested by Ireland and the Italian Republic, instead raised a plea going to the substantive legality of the contested decision, which falls within the scope of an infringement of the EC Treaty.",prem,"[' raise plea', ' base infringement', ' suggest ireland', 'court raise plea', ' go legality', 'which fall scope']"
"Yet, as submitted by the Commission and as stated by the Advocate General in points 57 to 63 of his Opinion, none of the applicants before the General Court relied on such a plea.",prem,"[' submit commission', ' state general', ' state point', 'number rely plea']"
"It is clear from the General Court’s file that the question of attributability of the exemptions at issue, merely alluded to by the Commission in its defence in Case T‑56/06, and by Eurallumina in its reply in Case T‑62/06, where however it stated that ‘[h]owever … it is not necessary to address this issue’, was introduced into the debate by the General Court by sending a written question to the parties, and, it may be added, it is also clear from paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['question allude commission', 'question allude eurallumina', 'it state ', ' to address issue', ' be introduce debate', ' be introduce court', ' send question', 'it may be add ']"
"Contrary to what is maintained by the French Republic, Eurallumina and AAL, it cannot be held that the General Court engaged in an amplification of the pleas raised by the parties.",prem,"['what be maintain republic', 'it can be not hold ', 'court engage amplification', ' raise party']"
"Although the General Court may have linked the question of the attributability of the exemptions at issue with the pleas relied on by the parties, alleging infringement of the principles of the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures and legal certainty, it remains the case, first, that that question derives from a plea in law which is distinct and different in kind, its subject being not an infringement of general principles of European Union law but an infringement of the EC Treaty and, secondly, that the parties, as is clear from, in particular, the account of the parties’ pleas set out in paragraphs 53 to 56 of the judgment under appeal, did not plead those principles with a view to the court finding that the exemptions at issue did not constitute State aid.",prem,"['court may have link question', 'court may have link plea', ' rely party', ' allege infringement', ' attach measure', 'it remain case', 'question derive plea', ' set paragraph', 'number do plead principle', 'number do plead view', 'rt find aid']"
"It follows that, by raising of its own motion the plea that the exemptions at issue were attributable not to the Member States but to the European Union, and, for that reason, did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, the General Court caused the judgment under appeal to be vitiated by an error in law.",prem,"['it follow ', ' raise plea', ' raise motion', 'company do stitute aid', 'company do stitute meaning', 'court cause ', 'judgment to be vitiate error']"
"However, the reasoning relating to the attributability of the exemptions at issue, dealt with only in paragraphs 73, 74, 98, 99 and 104 of the judgment under appeal, constitutes only one element of the grounds stated in that judgment.",prem,"[' relate attributability', ' deal appeal', 'reasoning stitute element', 'company stitute element', ' state judgment']"
It is therefore necessary to examine whether that judgment remains well founded on the basis of the other grounds stated.,prem,['judgment remain basis']
"The General Court, in addition to the considerations relating to the non‑attributability of the exemptions at issue to the Member States, based the judgment under appeal on the following grounds.",prem,"[' relate attributability', 'court base judgment', 'court base appeal', 'court base ground']"
"In paragraphs 63 to 72 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held, first, that, in the light of the fact that the rules governing the harmonisation of national fiscal legislation and the rules on State aid have a shared objective, namely to promote the proper functioning of the internal market, by combating, inter alia, distortions of competition, the concept of distortion of competition had to be regarded as having the same scope and the same meaning in both those areas, in order to ensure the consistent implementation of those rules.",prem,"['court hold ', ' govern harmonisation', ' to promote functioning', 'cept have ', ' have scope', ' to ensure implementation']"
"The General Court stated, in that regard, that Article 8(4) and (5) of Directive 92/81 confers in particular on the Commission, which submits a proposal, and the Council, which enacts a measure, the responsibility for assessing whether there is any distortion of competition, in order to decide whether or not to authorise a Member State to apply or continue to apply an exemption from the harmonised excise duty and that, if the assessments differ, the Commission has the option of bringing an action for annulment of the Council’s decision.",prem,"['court state regard', 'article fer commission', 'article fer order', 'company fer commission', 'company fer order', 'which submit proposal', 'which enact measure', 'there be distortion', ' to decide whether', 'state to apply ', ' to apply exemption', 'assessment differ ', 'commission have option', ' bring action']"
"The General Court then found, in paragraphs 76 to 97 of the judgment under appeal, that, in this case, it was not in dispute that Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic had, in order to apply or continue to apply the exemptions at issue until 31 December 2003, relied on the authorisation decisions and that they had fully complied with those decisions which, in so far as restrictive conditions of a geographical and temporal nature were attached to them, were binding on those Member States.",prem,"['court find paragraph', ' to apply exemption', ' to apply december', 'ireland have rely decision', 'they have ply decision', 'dition be attach they', 'which be bind states']"
"In that context, in paragraphs 79 to 96 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court discounted the Commission’s arguments that the authorisation decisions, first, were a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of the Member States being able to grant the exemptions at issue and, second, did not alter the fact that, if those exemptions constituted State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, they had to be notified to the Commission and be authorised by it, in accordance with Article 88 EC, as stated in recital 5 in the preamble to Decision 2001/224.",prem,"['court discount argument', ' to grant exemption', ' to grant issue', 'number do alter fact', ' stitute aid', ' stitute meaning', ' to be ifie commission', ' be authorise it', ' state recital']"
"The General Court observed, in that regard, that the authorisation decisions prior to Decision 2001/224 contained no such qualification and held that recital 5 could not be construed as a manifestation of the Council’s intention to make the effects of its authorisation conditional on compliance with any subsequent procedures and decisions of the Commission in the area of State aid.",prem,"['court observe regard', 'decision taine qualification', 'court hold ', 'number be strue manifestation']"
"According to the General Court, the Commission’s interpretation of recital 5 in the preamble to Decision 2001/224 is rebutted by the Council’s reply to questions put by the General Court.",prem,"[' accord court', 'interpretation be rebut reply', ' put court']"
"Further, that interpretation could not, in any event, be accepted since it would result, in the circumstances of the case, in an inconsistent implementation of the rules governing the harmonisation of fiscal legislation and the rules on State aid, since, first, the authorisation decisions, adopted unanimously by the Council on a proposal from the Commission, were based on those two institutions’ shared assessment that the exemptions at issue did not give rise to a distortion of competition and did not impede the proper functioning of the internal market;",prem,"['number be accept ', 'it would result circumstance', 'it would result implementation', ' govern harmonisation', ' adopt council', ' adopt proposal', 'decision be base assessment', 'exemption do give rise', 'exemption do give distortion', 'exemption do impede functioning']"
"secondly, the fact that those exemptions were regionally selective was a direct consequence of those decisions and, thirdly, those decisions authorised full exemptions from excise duties.",prem,['decision authorise exemption']
"Last, after finding, in paragraphs 100 to 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had never used the powers available to it, under Article 8(5) of Directive 92/81 or Articles 230 EC and 241 EC, in order to secure the abolition or alteration of the authorisation decisions, an annulment of those decisions or a declaration that Directive 92/81 was invalid, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 104 and 105 of the judgment under appeal, that, when the contested decision was adopted, Decision 2001/224 remained valid and that that decision, the decisions which had preceded it and Directive 92/81 were entitled to the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures and produced all their legal effects.",prem,"[' find paragraph', 'commission have never use power', 'commission have never use article', 'commission have never use order', ' to secure abolition', 'court state paragraph', 'decision be adopt ', 'decision remain ', 'which have precede it', ' attach measure', ' produce effect']"
"The General Court held that, consequently, Ireland, the French Republic and the Italian Republic were entitled to rely on those decisions in order to continue to apply the exemptions at issue.",prem,"['court hold ', 'ireland be entitle ', ' to rely decision', ' to apply exemption']"
"The General Court concluded that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the contested decision directly called into question the validity of the exemptions at issue and also, indirectly, but necessarily, the validity of the authorisation decisions and the effects arising from those decisions, thereby infringing the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.",prem,"['company clude ', 'decision call validity', 'decision call question', ' arise decision', ' infringe principle', ' attach measure']"
"Further, in paragraphs 107 to 109 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court upheld the complaint alleging an infringement of the principle of sound administration, raised by Eurallumina in Case T‑62/06 RENV, holding that such an infringement resulted from the fact that the Commission had adopted the contested decision without taking account of the specific rights which the Italian Republic had conferred on that company in accordance with Decision 2001/224, the effects of which were legally protected by the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.",prem,"['court uphold plaint', ' allege infringement', ' raise eurallumina', ' raise case', 'infringement result fact', 'commission have adopt decision', ' take account', ' take right', 'republic have ferre pany', 'republic have ferre accordance', 'effect be protect principle', ' attach measure']"
"In so ruling, the General Court disregarded, however, the respective powers of the Council and the Commission in the area of the harmonisation of legislation relating to excise duties, on the one hand, and in the area of State aid, on the other.",prem,"['court disregard power', ' relate duty']"
"It must be borne in mind that Directive 92/81 was adopted on the basis of Article 99 of the EEC Treaty (which became Article 99 of the EC Treaty, which itself became Article 93 EC) which conferred on the Council the power to adopt provisions for the harmonisation of legislation concerning turnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation to the extent that that harmonisation was necessary to ensure the establishment and functioning of the internal market.",prem,"['it must be bear mind', 'directive be adopt basis', 'which become article', 'which become ec', 'which ferre power', 'which ferre council', 'which ferre extent', ' to adopt provision', ' to ensure establishment']"
"The authorisation decisions were adopted pursuant to Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81, which granted to the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, the power to authorise any Member State to introduce exemptions or reductions other than those laid down by that directive ‘for specific policy considerations’.",prem,"['decision be adopt ', 'which grant power', ' act proposal', ' to authorise state', ' to introduce exemption', ' lay directive', ' lay sideration']"
The purpose and the scope of the procedure laid down in that article differ from those of the rules established in Article 88 EC.,prem,"[' lay article', 'purpose differ those', ' establish ec']"
"As the Court held in paragraphs 29 to 31 of Case C-110/02 Commission v Council [2004] ECR I-6333, the intention of the EC Treaty, in providing through Article 88 EC for aid to be kept under constant review and monitored by the Commission, is that the finding that aid may be incompatible with the common market is to be arrived at, subject to review by the General Court and the Court of Justice, by means of an appropriate procedure which it is the Commission’s responsibility to set in motion.",prem,"['court hold paragraph', ' provide ec', 'aid to be keep review', 'aid monitor commission', ' to be arrive mean', ' to set motion']"
Articles 87 EC and 88 EC thus reserve a central role for the Commission in determining whether aid is incompatible.,prem,['ec reserve role']
"The power conferred upon the Council in the area of State aid by the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) EC is exceptional in character, which means that it must necessarily be interpreted strictly (see also, to that effect, the judgment of 4 December 2013 in Case C‑111/10 Commission v Council [2013] ECR, paragraph 39).",prem,"['company ferre council', 'company ferre area', 'company ferre subparagraph', 'which mean ', 'it must be interpret ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"Consequently, a Council decision authorising a Member State, in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81, to introduce an exemption of excise duties could not have the effect of preventing the Commission from exercising the powers conferred on it by the Treaty and, consequently, setting in motion the procedure laid down in Article 88 EC in order to review whether that exemption constituted State aid and on the conclusion of that procedure, if appropriate, to adopt a decision such as the contested decision.",prem,"[' authorise state', ' authorise accordance', ' to introduce exemption', ' to introduce number', 'decision have effect', ' prevent commission', ' exercise power', 'company ferre it', 'company ferre treaty', ' set procedure', ' set motion', ' lay ec', 'company stitute aid', ' to adopt decision']"
The fact that the authorisation decisions granted full exemptions from excise duties while setting detailed conditions of a geographical and temporal nature and that those conditions were strictly respected by the Member States had no effect on the division of powers between the Council and the Commission and therefore could not deprive the Commission of the right to exercise its powers.,prem,"['decision grant exemption', ' set dition', 'dition be respect states', 'fact have effect', 'number deprive commission', 'number deprive right', ' to exercise power']"
"It may be added that respect for that division of powers prompted recital 5 of Decision 2001/224, which was in force in the period for which the contested decision orders the recovery of aid, to state that Decision 2001/224 was to be without prejudice to the outcome of any procedures that might be undertaken under Articles 87 EC and 88 EC and that it did not override ‘the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission …’.",prem,"['it may be add ', 'respect prompt recital', 'company test order', 'that might be undertake ec', 'it do override requirement', 'states to number instance']"
"Admittedly, the authorisation decisions were adopted on a proposal from the Commission and the latter never used the powers available to it, under Article 8(5) of Directive 92/81 or Articles 230 EC and 241 EC, in order to secure the abolition or alteration of the authorisation decisions, an annulment of those decisions or a declaration that Directive 92/81 was invalid.",prem,"['decision be adopt proposal', 'latter never use power', 'latter never use article', 'latter never use order', ' to secure abolition']"
"It is clear, in that regard, from the contested decision that the Commission had taken the view, at the time when the Council adopted the authorisation decisions, that those decisions did not give rise to a distortion of competition and did not impede the proper functioning of the internal market (Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 83).",prem,"['commission have take view', 'council adopt decision', 'decision do give rise', 'decision do give distortion', 'decision do impede functioning']"
"However, as claimed by the Commission, the concept of State aid corresponds to an objective situation and cannot depend on the conduct or statements of the institutions (Commission v Ireland and Others, paragraph 72).",prem,"[' claim commission', 'cept respond situation', 'cept can not depend duct']"
"Consequently, the fact that the authorisation decisions were adopted on a proposal from the Commission could not preclude those exemptions being classified as State aid, within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, if the conditions governing the existence of State aid were met.",prem,"['decision be adopt proposal', 'fact preclude ', 'exemption be classify aid', 'exemption be classify meaning', ' govern existence', 'dition be meet ']"
"That fact however had to be taken into consideration in relation to the obligation to recover the incompatible aid, in the light of the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty, as was done by the Commission in the contested decision when it declined to order the recovery of aid granted before the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of the decisions to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) EC.",prem,"['fact have ', ' to be take sideration', ' to be take relation', ' to recover aid', ' to recover light', ' be do commission', ' be do decision', 'it decline ', ' to order recovery', ' grant date', ' to initiate procedure', ' lay ec']"
It follows that the grounds of the judgment under appeal set out in paragraphs 39 to 44 of this judgment cannot provide a legal basis for the General Court’s conclusion that the contested decision calls into question the validity of the Council’s authorisation decisions and thereby is in breach of the principles of legal certainty and the presumption of legality attaching to European Union measures.,prem,"['it follow ', ' set paragraph', 'ground can not provide basis', 'decision call validity', 'decision call question', ' attach measure']"
"The same is true of the conclusion, based on the same grounds, that, in Case T‑62/06 RENV, the Commission infringed the principle of sound administration.",prem,"[' base ground', 'commission infringe principle']"
"In the light of the foregoing, the judgment under appeal must be set aside in its entirety, there being no need to examine the parties’ other arguments and pleas.",conc,"['judgment must be set entirety', ' to examine party']"
