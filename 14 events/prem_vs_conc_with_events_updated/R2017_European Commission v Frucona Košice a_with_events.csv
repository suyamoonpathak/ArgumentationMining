"According to the settled case-law of the Court, classification as ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU requires that all the conditions set out in that provision are fulilled.",prem,"[' accord law', 'classification require ', ' set provision', 'dition be fulille ']"
"Thus, first, there must be intervention by the State or through State resources;",prem,[]
"second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States;",prem,[' to affect trade']
"third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient;",prem,['it must fer advantage']
"fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 40, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53).",prem,"['it must distort ', 'it threaten ', ' to distort judgment']"
"The concept of ‘aid’ embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, therefore, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 30).",prem,"['cept embrace benefit', 'which mitigate charge', 'which be include budget', 'which have judgment']"
"However, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['measure must meet ', ' to be treat aid', ' to be treat purpose', 'dition be meet ', 'company respond dition', 'recipient have obtain advantage', 'which have be make available', 'which have be make judgment']"
"When a public creditor grants payment facilities in respect of a debt payable to it by an undertaking, that assessment is made by applying, in principle, the private creditor test (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 32).",prem,"['creditor grant facility', 'creditor grant respect', 'assessment be make ', ' apply judgment', ' apply principle']"
"Accordingly, the private creditor test is not an exception which applies only if a Member State so requests, when all the constituent elements of State aid incompatible with the common market, as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, exist.",prem,"['which apply ', 'state request ', ' lay tfeu', 'element exist ']"
"In fact, that test, where applicable, is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing whether such aid exists (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 103, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 32).",prem,"['commission be require ', ' to take account', ' to take purpose', 'aid exist ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"As a result, where it appears that the private creditor test might be applicable, it is for the Commission to ask the Member State concerned to provide it with all the relevant information enabling it to determine whether the conditions for applying that test are satisfied (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 33).",prem,"['it appear ', 'commission to ask company', ' to provide it', ' to provide information', ' enable it', ' apply test', ' satisfy judgment']"
"In the first place, it is clear from that case-law of the Court that, when it appears that the private creditor test might be applicable, it is for the Commission to examine that possibility, irrespective of any request to that effect.",prem,"['it appear ', 'commission to examine possibility']"
"Accordingly, as the Advocate General noted in points 72 and 76 of his Opinion, nothing prevents the recipient of the aid from invoking the applicability of that test and, if the recipient does invoke that test, it falls to the Commission to assess whether the test needs to be applied and, if so, to assess its application.",prem,"['hing prevent recipient', ' invoke applicability', 'recipient do invoke test', 'it fall commission', 'test need ', ' to assess application']"
"In the second place, as regards the relevance of the subjective state of mind, it must be noted, as the Advocate General pointed out in point 74 of his Opinion, that the starting point for determining whether the private operator test is to be applied must be the economic nature of the Member State’s action, not how that Member State, subjectively speaking, thought it was acting or which alternative courses of action it considered before adopting the measure in question.",prem,"[' regard relevance', 'general point point', 'state think ', 'it be act ', 'it sidere ', ' adopt measure']"
"In any case, the private creditor test is intended to determine whether the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor that sought to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 72) and, accordingly, whether that undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 70).",prem,"['test be intend ', 'undertaking would have obtain facility', 'undertaking would have obtain creditor', 'undertaking would have obtain situation', 'undertaking would have obtain judgment', 'that seek ', ' to recover sum', 'company respond dition', 'ld have obtain advantage', 'ld have obtain judgment', 'which have be make available']"
"It follows from this that the assessment which the Commission is required, where appropriate, to carry out cannot be limited to just the options that the competent public authority actually took into consideration, but must necessarily cover all the options that a private creditor would reasonably have envisaged in such a situation.",prem,"['it follow this', 'commission be require ', 'assessment can be not limit option', 'authority take sideration', 'assessment must company option', 'creditor would have envisage situation']"
"As for the argument put forward by the Commission in the context of the fourth ground of appeal, it suffices to note that the General Court did not err in law when it stated, in paragraph 247 of the judgment under appeal, that, since the private creditor test was applicable as such, the Commission could not make a distinction, as regards the applicability of the test, based on the various alternatives to the measure at issue.",prem,"[' put commission', ' put text', 'it suffice number', 'it state paragraph', 'number make distinction', ' regard applicability', ' base alternative']"
"First, it must be stated that the decision at issue does not expressly specify that the private creditor test is inapplicable in the present case.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'decision do specify ']"
"On the contrary, it applies that test and its conclusion, stated in recitals 139 and 140, that the measure at issue does constitute State aid, is explicitly based on its application.",prem,"['it apply test', ' state recital', 'measure do stitute aid', ' be base application']"
"Second, it must be noted that if the Commission had any doubt as to the applicability of the test, it should, as is clear from paragraph 24 of the present judgment, have asked the Slovak State for relevant information in that regard and carried out an overall assessment of that evidence (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 86).",prem,"['commission have doubt', 'it should have ask state', 'it should have ask information', 'it carry assessment', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"However, the decision at issue makes no mention of such a request or such an assessment.",prem,['decision make mention']
"Lastly, it should be noted that the Commission applied the private creditor test after having stated, in paragraphs 84 and 86 of the decision at issue, that the recipient had claimed that acceptance of the proposed arrangement did not constitute State aid because the bankruptcy procedure would have been less favourable for the Slovak State.",prem,"['commission apply test', ' having state paragraph', 'recipient have claim ']"
"As the third ground of appeal relates to reasoning that was included for the sake of completeness in support of the General Court’s decision that the private creditor test was applicable to the facts of the present case, and since the first, second and fourth grounds of appeal, which criticise the same decision of the General Court, have been rejected as unfounded,",prem,"['ground relate reasoning', 'that be include sake', 'that be include support', 'which criticise decision', 'ground have be reject ']"
"As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal, in essence, relate to the extent of the Commission’s investigation obligations when carrying out a private creditor test assessments, as held by the General Court during its examination of the parts of the decision at issue relating to the bankruptcy procedure and the tax execution procedure.",prem,"['ground relate extent', ' carry assessment', ' hold court', ' hold examination', ' relate procedure']"
"In accordance with the Court’s settled case-law, when applying the private creditor test, the Commission must carry out an overall assessment, taking into account all relevant evidence in the case enabling it to determine whether the recipient company would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from such a private creditor (see, to that effect, judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 73, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 47).",prem,"[' apply test', 'commission must carry assessment', 'commission must carry judgment', ' take evidence', ' take account', ' enable it', 'company would have obtain facility', 'company would have obtain creditor', ' see effect']"
"In that regard, all information liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor, who is in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and is seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor experiencing difficulty in making the payments, must be regarded as being relevant (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 78, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 54).",prem,"[' to have influence', 'who be seek ', ' to recover sum', ' to recover debtor', ' experience difficulty', ' make payment', 'creditor must be regard ']"
"Moreover, for the purposes of applying the private creditor test, the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the decision was taken (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 105).",prem,"[' apply test', 'decision be take ', ' see judgment', ' see p', ' see effect']"
"Such an examination by the Commission of whether particular measures can be classified as State aid because the public authorities did not act in the same way as a private creditor requires a complex economic assessment (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 74, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 48).",prem,"['measure can be classify aid', 'authority do act way', 'examination require judgment']"
"In this connection, it must be observed that, in the context of a review by the Courts of the European Union of complex economic assessments made by the Commission in the field of State aid, it is not for those Courts to substitute their own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 75, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 49).",prem,"['it must be observe ', ' make commission', ' make field', 'courts to substitute assessment', 'courts to substitute that']"
"However, the Courts of the European Union must, inter alia, establish not only whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the relevant information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 76, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C‑405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 50).",prem,"['courts must establish number', 'company tain information', 'which must be take account', ' to assess situation', ' substantiate clusion', ' draw it', ' draw judgment']"
"In the present case, it is necessary to examine, in the first place, the arguments put forward by the Commission in the context of the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal directed against the part of the judgment under appeal relating to the bankruptcy procedure.",prem,"[' to examine argument', ' to examine place', ' put commission', ' put text', ' direct part', ' relate procedure']"
"In this respect, first, it is necessary to reject the Commission’s arguments alleging that the subjective state of mind of the competent public body must first be determined and that the attitude of that body must then be compared with that of a hypothetical private creditor: the relevance of such reasoning has already been rejected in the context of the examination of the second and fourth grounds of appeal in so far as that reasoning is based on an incorrect assessment of the private creditor test.",prem,"[' to reject argument', 'state must be determine ', 'attitude must be pare that', 'relevance have be reject text', 'reasoning be base assessment']"
"Second, in so far as the Commission criticises the General Court for having created, inter alia by failing to limit the Commission’s verification obligation to the evidence available to it, a new requirement imposing on it the excessive burden of having to seek all ‘imaginable’ evidence and information, it is clear that the Commission’s argument is based on an incorrect reading of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['commission criticise court', ' to limit obligation', ' to limit requirement', ' impose burden', ' impose it', ' to seek evidence', 'argument be base reading']"
"In this respect, it must, first of all, be noted that the General Court indicated, inter alia in paragraphs 134 to 137 of the judgment under appeal, that the assessment of the private creditor test must be made in relation to a situation as close as possible to that of the public authority in question.",prem,"['court indicate paragraph', 'assessment must be make relation']"
"Next, the General Court set out, in paragraphs 138 to 143 of the judgment under appeal, the principles that in its view govern the burden of proof on the Commission and, in that context, pointed out the evidence that the institution must, where appropriate, obtain and take into consideration in its examination, as well as the general limits of its investigatory obligations, as identified by the case-law of the Courts of the European Union.",prem,"['court set principle', 'court set paragraph', 'that govern burden', 'court point evidence', 'institution must obtain ', 'institution take sideration', 'institution take examination', ' identify law']"
"In this connection, it should also be borne in mind that the lawfulness of a decision concerning State aid falls to be assessed by the European Union judicature in the light of the information available to the Commission at the time when the decision was adopted (judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C‑290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it should be bear mind', ' cerne aid', 'lawfulness fall ', ' to be assess judicature', ' to be assess light', 'decision be adopt ']"
"However, the information ‘available’ to the Commission includes that which seemed relevant to the assessment to be carried out in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 59 to 61 of the present judgment and which could have been obtained, upon request by the Commission, during the administrative procedure.",prem,"['information include that', 'which seem relevant', ' to be carry accordance', ' refer paragraph', ' have be obtain request', ' have be obtain procedure']"
"Lastly, in paragraphs 171 to 178 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that, according to its case-law, the Commission is in no way subject to a general obligation to commission outside consultants, and on this ground rejected Frucona Košice’s claims that the institution should have obtained new reports by external experts.",prem,"[' accord law', 'commission reject claim', 'institution should have obtain report']"
"Paragraphs 180 to 213 and 235 of the judgment under appeal, against which the Commission’s objections referred to in paragraph 64 of the present judgment are directed, when read in the legal context referred to by the General Court, do not imply new requirements that are incompatible with the case-law of the Court of Justice.",prem,"[' refer paragraph', 'objection be direct ', ' read text', ' refer court', 'paragraph do imply requirement']"
"Thus, the factual findings made in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal — that the Commission had determined the liquidation factors by way of inference from the evidence in the administrative file, had not carried out any methodological or economic analysis and had not requested additional information intended to verify and substantiate the conclusions which it had drawn from that evidence — cannot be read as containing a requirement that goes beyond those demanded by the principles noted by the General Court in paragraphs 138 to 143 of the judgment under appeal or that would be incompatible with those set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the present judgment.",prem,"[' make paragraph', 'commission have determine factor', 'commission have determine way', 'commission have carry analysis', ' have request information', ' substantiate clusion', 'it have draw evidence', 'finding can be not read taining', 'that go those', ' demand principle', ' e court', ' set paragraph']"
"Concerning the General Court’s findings of fact in paragraphs 186, 196, 200 and 201 of the judgment under appeal — that the evidence on the administrative file did not substantiate to the requisite legal standard the Commission’s assessment of the liquidation factors and that, accordingly, it should have sought to obtain additional information in order to substantiate its conclusions — these assessments in no way exceed the limits of judicial review of a manifest error of assessment which is to be carried out by the General Court in accordance with the case-law noted in paragraph 64 of the present judgment, and cannot be considered to introduce a requirement that would be incompatible with the principles set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the present judgment.",prem,"[' concern finding', 'evidence do substantiate assessment', 'evidence do substantiate standard', 'it should have seek ', ' to obtain information', ' to substantiate clusion', 'assessment exceed limit', ' to be carry court', ' to be carry accordance', 'assessment can be not sidere ', ' to introduce requirement', ' set paragraph']"
"To the extent that the General Court held, in paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, that the evidence on the administrative file must substantiate the conclusions drawn by the Commission not only to the requisite legal standard but also unequivocally, it suffices to note that it is clear from paragraphs 187 to 201 of the judgment under appeal that, in any case, the General Court did not carry out its assessment by reference to such a requirement and did not allude to it in the context of its considerations in paragraphs 196, 200, 201 and 235 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['court hold paragraph', 'evidence must substantiate clusion', 'evidence must substantiate standard', ' draw commission', 'it suffice ', 'court do carry assessment', 'court do carry reference', 'court do carry text', 'court do allude it']"
"As the Advocate General noted in paragraphs 125 and 131 of his Opinion, the General Court merely noted, in paragraphs 191 to 195, 198 and 199 of the judgment under appeal, the internal contradictions of the decision at issue and made findings of fact according to which none of the evidence on the administrative file was able to substantiate the liquidation factors used by the Commission.",prem,"[' make finding', ' to substantiate factor', ' use commission']"
"Accordingly, contrary to the Commission’s submissions, the General Court did not apply an incorrect legal test.",prem,['court do apply test']
"It follows that the Commission’s claims must be rejected as, in part, ineffective and, in part, unfounded.",prem,"['it follow ', 'claim must be reject ']"
"In the second place, in so far as the Commission claims that the errors of law which it identified also vitiated the General Court’s assessment of the length of the bankruptcy procedure, in paragraphs 223 to 235 of the judgment under appeal, as well as its assessment of the tax execution procedure, in paragraphs 277 to 284 of that judgment, it is sufficient to state that, since an examination of the Commission’s claims has not led to a finding of an error of law, that line of argument is wholly unfounded.",prem,"['commission claim ', 'it identify ', 'error vitiate assessment', 'examination have lead finding']"
"Moreover, in paragraphs 279, 282 and 283 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission had failed, first, to obtain information on the anticipated duration of a tax execution procedure, second, to take into account that it was likely to be interrupted by the initiation of the bankruptcy procedure and, third, to obtain information concerning the costs that such a procedure might generate.",prem,"['court find ', 'commission have fail ', ' to obtain information', ' to take account', ' to be interrupt initiation', ' to obtain information', ' cerne t', 'procedure might generate ']"
"Such considerations, in so far as they concern the information that a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local tax office could not a priori ignore, are capable, in themselves, of justifying the General Court’s decision that the Commission failed to take into consideration all the relevant information (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraphs 77, 78 and 81).",prem,"['they cern information', 'number ignore ', ' justify decision', 'commission fail ', ' to take judgment', ' to take sideration', ' see effect']"
"Furthermore, it follows from paragraphs 69 to 84 of the present judgment that, contrary to the Commission’s claim, it is apparent from the judgment under appeal that the General Court did explain, to the requisite legal standard, first, the extent of the Commission’s investigation obligations and, second, the kind of additional evidence the Commission could have requested.",prem,"['it follow paragraph', 'court do explain extent', 'court do explain standard', 'ld have request ']"
"Accordingly, the second and fourth grounds of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.",conc,['ground must be reject ']
"In those circumstances, the first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.",conc,['ground must be reject ']
