"First of all, it should be noted that the Practice directions to parties are indicative and have no binding force.",prem,['direction have force']
"As is apparent from recitals 1 to 3 of those directions, they were adopted in order to supplement and clarify the rules applicable to the conduct of proceedings before the Court, in the interest of the proper administration of justice, and are not intended to replace the relevant provisions of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure of the Court (see, to that effect, order of the President of the Court of 30 April 2010, Ziegler v Commission, C‑113/09 P(R), not published, EU:C:2010:242, paragraph 33).",prem,"['they be adopt ', ' clarify rule', ' clarify interest', 'they be intend ', ' to replace provision', ' see order', ' see euc2010242', ' see effect']"
"It is therefore clearly apparent from the wording of paragraph 20 of those practice directions, which state that ‘the appeal …, unless there are special circumstances, should not exceed 25 pages’, that that recital does not set out an absolute limitation on the number of pages to which the admissibility of such an appeal is subject, but that it merely provides a recommendation in that regard to the parties.",prem,"['which state ', 'there be circumstance', ' number exceed page', 'recital do set limitation', 'it provide recommendation', 'it provide regard', 'it provide party']"
It follows that the appeal may not be rejected as inadmissible on the ground that it exceeds a certain number of pages.,prem,"['it follow ', 'appeal may be reject ground', 'number may be reject ground', 'it exceed number']"
"Secondly, it should be noted that, according to the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure, an appeal must, on penalty of being deemed inadmissible, indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal, failing which the appeal or the ground of appeal in question will be dismissed as inadmissible (see, inter alia, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' accord subparagraph', ' be deem inadmissible', 'appeal must indicate ', 'company test element', 'appellant seek ', ' advance support', 'appeal will be dismiss ', ' see judgment']"
"Moreover, it follows from those same provisions that an appeal is inadmissible in so far as it merely repeats the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by it.",prem,"['it follow provision', 'it repeat plea', ' submit court', ' include those', ' base fact', ' reject it']"
"Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to undertake on appeal (see judgment of 30 May 2013, Quinn Barlo and Others v Commission, C‑70/12 P, not published, EU:C:2013:351, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['appeal amount reality', ' submit court', 'court do have jurisdiction', ' to undertake appeal', 'appeal see judgment']"
"By contrast, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of EU law by the General Court, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal.",prem,"['appellant challenge interpretation', ' examine instance', 'point may be discuss rse']"
"Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the General Court, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose (see judgment of 30 May 2013, Quinn Barlo and Others v Commission, C‑70/12 P, not published, EU:C:2013:351, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['number base appeal', 'number base plea', ' rely court', 'appeal would be deprive part', 'appeal see judgment']"
"In the present case, it should be noted that it is apparent from the review of the appeal that DTS has set out clearly and precisely the paragraphs of the judgment under appeal referred to in its grounds of appeal, as well as the reasons why that judgment, in its submission, is vitiated by errors of law.",prem,"['dts have set paragraph', ' refer ground', 'judgment be vitiate error']"
"Moreover, contrary to what RTVE and the Kingdom of Spain submit, DTS does not merely repeat, in its appeal, the arguments made at first instance.",prem,"['rtve submit ', ' repeat argument', ' repeat appeal', ' make instance']"
"It disputes, in fact, for the most part, the manner in which the General Court interpreted and applied EU law, in particular Article 107(1) TFEU, in holding, in the judgment under appeal, that the tax on pay-television operators for which it is liable is not an integral part of the aid granted to RTVE and, for the remainder, it accuses the General Court of having distorted the law and, accordingly, vitiated that judgment.",prem,"['it dispute manner', 'it dispute fact', 'it dispute part', 'court interpret ', 'court apply law', 'court apply tfeu', ' hold judgment', 'it accuse court', ' having distort law', ' vitiate judgment']"
"It should be noted that the Court of Justice has consistently held that where the General Court has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, under Article 256 TFEU, solely to review the legal characterisation of those facts and the conclusions in law drawn from them.",prem,"['court have hold ', 'court have establish ', 'court assess fact', 'court have jurisdiction', 'court have tfeu', ' to review characterisation', ' draw they']"
"The appraisal of the facts by the General Court does not therefore constitute, save where the clear sense of the evidence produced before it is distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see, inter alia, judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 78).",prem,"[' produce it', 'sense be distort ', ' see judgment']"
"Thus, with respect to the assessment, in the context of an appeal, of the General Court’s determinations on national law, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction only to determine whether that law was distorted (see judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['court have jurisdiction', 'law be distort ', ' see judgment']"
"In that regard, it should be noted that distortion must be obvious from the documents on the Court’s file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 80).",prem,[' to carry assessment']
"In the present case, it should be recalled that in paragraphs 65 to 86 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court concluded, in the light of the terms of Law No 8/2009, that, as noted by the Commission, in its view, correctly, the amount of the aid to be given to RTVE does not depend on the amount of the tax levy imposed on DTS, since the amount of the aid is fixed by reference to the net costs of fulfilling RTVE’s public service mandate.",prem,"['it should be recall ', 'company clude light', ' e commission', 'amount do depend amount', ' impose dts', 'amount be fix reference', ' fulfil mandate']"
"In that regard, the General Court, on the one hand, observed in paragraph 66 of that judgment that, under Article 33 of Law No 17/2006, in the event that the income available to RTVE exceeds the costs of fulfilling its public service broadcasting mandate, the surplus is to be reallocated, in so far as it does not exceed 10% of RTVE’s budgeted annual costs, to a reserve fund or the treasury.",prem,"['court observe paragraph', 'income exceed t', ' fulfil mandate', ' to be reallocate fund', ' exceed 10']"
"As regards the first of those situations, the General Court stated, in paragraph 67 of that judgment, that it is apparent from Article 8 of Law No 8/2009 that the capital may be used only with the express authorisation of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and that, if it is not used within four years, it must be used to reduce the compensation to be drawn from the general budget of the Spanish State.",prem,"[' regard first', 'court state paragraph', 'capital may be use authorisation', 'it be use year', 'it must be use ', ' to reduce pensation', ' to be draw budget']"
"Moreover, the General Court noted, in paragraph 68 of the same judgment, that Article 3(2) of Law No 8/2009 lays down an absolute limit on RTVE’s income, which is set at EUR 1200 million for 2010 and 2011 and that any surplus over and above that ceiling is to be directly re-allocated to the general budget of the Spanish State.",prem,"['article lay limit', 'which be set million', ' allocate budget']"
"In the second place, in paragraphs 69, 76 and 80 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that, under Article 2(2) of Law No 8/2009, in the event that the income available to RTVE is insufficient to cover the costs of fulfilling its public service broadcasting mandate, the Spanish State is required to cover the shortfall by means of contributions from its general budget.",prem,"['number e ', ' to company company', ' fulfil mandate', 'state be require ', ' to company shortfall', ' to company mean']"
"In the present case, it is clear that, under the cloak of criticising the General Court for having erred in law when conducting a judicial review of the contested decision and distorted the national law provisions, while having failed to take others into consideration, DTS and the Telefónica companies are actually merely criticising the General Court’s interpretation of national law in paragraphs 65 to 86 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"[' criticise court', ' having err law', 'review test decision', 'review distort provision', ' to take other', ' to take sideration', 'dts be criticise interpretation', 'dts be criticise paragraph', 'dts be criticise appeal']"
"Their purpose is thus to substitute an alternative interpretation thereto and, accordingly, to obtain, by relying, in particular, on national provisions whose merits were not considered at first instance, a new assessment of the facts and evidence.",prem,"[' to substitute interpretation', ' to obtain assessment', ' rely provision', 'merit be sidere instance']"
"They are not seeking to show that the General Court made findings manifestly conflicting with that national legislation or that, in relation to the items in the file, it should have given that legislation a scope which it clearly does not have.",prem,"['they be seek ', 'court make finding', ' flicte legislation', 'it should have give scope', 'it do have ']"
"It should be recalled that, in paragraphs 92 and 93 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that, by its arguments alleging infringement of Article 107(1) TFEU because of the relationship between the fiscal measures at issue and the competitive advantage enjoyed by RTVE, DTS was seeking to call into question the principle derived from the case-law of the Court, enshrined in paragraph 80 of the judgment of 20 September 2001, Banks (C‑390/98, EU:C:2001:456), to the effect that persons liable to pay an obligatory contribution cannot rely on the argument that the exemption enjoyed by other persons constitutes State aid in order to avoid payment of that contribution .",prem,"['it should be recall ', 'court find ', ' allege infringement', ' enjoy rtve', 'dts be seek ', ' to call principle', ' to call question', ' to call effect', ' derive law', ' enshrine paragraph', ' to pay tribution', 'person can not rely argument', ' enjoy company', 'exemption stitute aid', ' to avoid payment']"
"The complaint made by DTS with regard to those findings in the context of the first part of the first ground of appeal is incapable of leading to the judgment under appeal being set aside, since, as correctly argued by RTVE and the Commission, the General Court rejected DTS’s submissions in that respect for the reasons set out not in paragraphs 92 and 93 of that judgment, but in paragraphs 94 to 105 thereof, relating to the relevance of the Laboratoires Boiron judgment for examination of the aid at issue, which grounds of appeal are the subject of the second part of the present plea.",prem,"[' make dts', ' make regard', 'judgment be set ', 'company argue rtve', 'court reject submission', 'court reject reason', ' set paragraph', ' relate relevance']"
"It is settled case-law of the Court that taxes do not fall within the scope of the provisions of the Treaty relating to State aid unless they constitute the method of financing an aid measure, so that they form an integral part of that measure (judgments of 13 January 2005, Streekgewest, C‑174/02, EU:C:2005:10, paragraph 25; of 13 January 2005 in Pape, C‑175/02, EU:C:2005:11, paragraph 14; and of 27 October 2005, Distribution Casino France and Others, C‑266/04 to C‑270/04, C‑276/04 and C‑321/04 to C‑325/04, EU:C:2005:657, paragraph 34).",prem,"['it be settle ', 'taxis do fall scope', ' relate aid', ' stitute method', ' finance measure', 'they form part']"
"Firstly, an aid, in the strict sense, may not substantially affect trade between Member States and thus be deemed admissible, but could have its disruptive effect exacerbated by a method of financing that would make the whole incompatible with the internal market.",prem,"['aid may affect trade', 'aid be deem admissible', 'ld have ', 'effect exacerbate method', 'that would make ']"
"Furthermore, where a tax specifically intended to finance aid proves to be contrary to other provisions of the Treaty, the Commission cannot declare the aid scheme of which the charge forms part to be compatible with the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 October 2003, van Calster and Others, C‑261/01 and C‑262/01, EU:C:2003:571, paragraphs 47 and 48 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' to finance aid', 'tax prove ', 'commission can not declare ', 'charge form part', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
The method by which aid is financed may render the entire aid scheme it is intended to fund incompatible with the internal market.,prem,"['aid be finance ', 'method may render ', 'it be intend ']"
"As a result, the aid cannot be considered separately from its method of financing (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 April 2005, AEM and AEM Torino, C‑128/03 and C‑129/03, EU:C:2005:224, paragraph 45).",prem,"[' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"According to settled case-law, in order for a tax to be regarded as forming an integral part of an aid measure, it must be hypothecated to the aid under the relevant national rules, in the sense that the revenue from the tax is necessarily allocated to the financing of the aid and has a direct impact on the amount of the aid and, consequently, on the assessment of the compatibility of that aid with the internal market (see, inter alia, judgments of 15 June 2006, Air Liquide Industries Belgium, C‑393/04 and C‑41/05, EU:C:2006:403, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited, and of 22 December 2008, Régie Networks, C‑333/07, EU:C:2008:764, paragraph 99).",prem,"[' accord law', 'tax to be regard ', ' form part', 'it must be hypothecate aid', 'it must be hypothecate rule', 'it must be hypothecate sense', 'revenue be allocate financing', 'revenue be allocate december', 'revenue have impact', 'revenue have judgment']"
"In the present case, the General Court found, in paragraphs 65 to 86 of the judgment under appeal, criticised in vain in the second ground of appeal, that it is clear from the applicable national law provisions that the amount of aid allocated to RTVE does not directly depend on the revenue from the fiscal measures at issue, since the amount thereof is determined on the basis of the net costs relating to the fulfilment of the public service mandate entrusted to RTVE.",prem,"['court find paragraph', ' criticise vain', ' criticise ground', ' allocate rtve', 'amount do depend revenue', 'amount be determine basis', ' relate fulfilment', ' entrust rtve']"
"In particular, as is apparent from paragraphs 47 and 48 of the present judgment, the General Court noted, in that regard, that when the tax revenues available to RTVE exceed the costs of fulfilling the latter’s public service mandate, the excess must be reassigned, as appropriate, to a reserve fund or the treasury, since those revenues, in addition, are subject to an absolute limit, with the result that any surplus is also reassigned to the State’s general budget.",prem,"['number e regard', 'revenue exceed t', ' fulfil mandate', 'excess must be reassign fund', 'surplus be reassign budget']"
"Moreover, the General Court found that, where those revenues are insufficient to cover these costs, the Spanish State is required to make up the difference.",prem,"['court find ', ' to company t', 'state be require ', ' to make difference']"
"In those circumstances, although it is common ground that the financing of the aid granted to RTVE is ensured by the fiscal measures at issue, the General Court, contrary to what DTS and the Telefónica companies submit, was nevertheless entitled to conclude, without committing an error of law, in paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal, that those fiscal measures do not form part of the aid.",prem,"['financing be ensure measure', 'dts submit ', 'court be entitle clude', 'court be entitle paragraph', 'company mitte error', ' form part']"
"Since the revenue from the fiscal measures at issue has no direct impact on the amount of the aid granted to RTVE, given that neither the grant or the amount of the aid are based on that revenue and that the revenue from that aid is not used to finance it, in that part of the revenue may be reallocated to other purposes, it cannot be held that those tax measures are hypothecated to the aid in question.",prem,"['revenue have impact', 'grant be base revenue', 'revenue be use ', ' to finance it', 'part may be reallocate purpose', 'it can be not hold ', 'measure be hypothecate aid']"
"It is irrelevant, in that regard, that the fiscal measures at issue were introduced in order to offset the loss of the commercial revenues formerly enjoyed by RTVE, in particular those derived from advertising (see, by analogy, judgment of 13 January 2005, Streekgewest, C‑174/02, EU:C:2005:10, paragraph 27).",prem,"['measure be introduce ', ' to offset loss', ' enjoy rtve', ' derive advertising', 'those see judgment', 'those see analogy']"
"DTS’s line of argument, based on the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, is not such as to call into question those findings.",prem,"[' base judgment', ' to call finding', ' to call question']"
"In that regard, it should be recalled that, in that judgment, the Court held, in essence, that, in the case of asymmetrical tax liability, that is where only one of two categories of competing traders is liable to pay a tax, traders liable to pay the tax may plead the illegality of it.",prem,"['it should be recall ', 'court hold essence', ' to pay tax', ' to pay tax', 'trader may plead illegality']"
"In such a case, the aid derives from the fact that another category of economic operators with which the category liable to pay the tax is in direct competition is not liable for that charge.",prem,"['aid derive fact', ' to pay tax']"
"The aid measure is therefore the tax itself, that tax and the aid constituting two elements of one and the same fiscal measure which are inseparable.",prem,[' stitute element']
"That situation is thus not comparable to that of any exemption from a tax of general application from which that tax may be distinguished (see, to that effect, Laboratoires Boiron judgment, paragraphs 30 to 48).",prem,"['tax may be distinguish ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"The General Court did not err in law in finding, in paragraphs 98 to 103 of the judgment under appeal, that the tax on pay-television operators for which DTS is liable is not comparable to the asymmetrical tax at issue in the case which gave rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment.",prem,"['court do number', ' find paragraph', 'which give rise', 'which give judgment']"
"In the present case, the fiscal measures at issue and the aid to RTVE do not constitute, as noted by the General Court in paragraph 101 of the judgment under appeal, two elements of one and the same fiscal measure which are inseparable, since, unlike the situation at issue in the case giving rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, the possible inapplicability of the fiscal measures at issue because of their possible incompatibility with EU law does not directly entail the calling into question of the aid, since, as is apparent from paragraphs 48 and 70 of the present judgment, the Spanish State is required to cover the shortfall between the sources of funding available to RTVE and all of the costs incurred by RTVE in carrying out its public service obligations.",prem,"[' e court', ' e paragraph', ' give rise', ' give judgment', 'inapplicability do entail calling', 'state be require ', ' to company shortfall', ' incur rtve', ' carry obligation']"
"In addition, and as also correctly noted by the General Court in paragraph 102 of the judgment under appeal, in the case giving rise to the Laboratoires Boiron judgment, the amount of the aid was determined only by the amount of the tax, since the benefit which the beneficiaries derived from the liability of their competitors to that tax necessarily depended on the amount of that tax.",prem,"[' e court', ' e paragraph', ' give rise', ' give judgment', 'amount be determine amount', 'beneficiary derive liability', 'benefit depend amount']"
"However, in the present case, the amount of the aid is determined, as is apparent from paragraphs 69 to 71 of the present judgment, by the net costs of fulfilling the public service mandate.",prem,"['amount be determine t', ' fulfil mandate']"
"Admittedly, as correctly noted by DTS, in the present case, the tax on pay-television operators is also intended to finance an aid scheme in favour of RTVE which the Commission found to be constitutive of State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU.",prem,"[' e dts', 'tax be intend ', ' to finance scheme', 'commission find ']"
"The obligation to pay that tax thus causes DTS an additional competitive disadvantage on the markets on which it operates in competition with RTVE, since the latter is not liable to pay such a tax.",prem,"[' to pay tax', 'obligation cause disadvantage', 'it operate petition', ' to pay tax']"
"However, as the General Court correctly pointed out, in paragraphs 84 and 102 of the judgment under appeal, that fact alone is not sufficient to demonstrate that such a tax is an integral part of the aid.",prem,['company point paragraph']
"On the one hand, as the Court has already held, the question whether a tax is an integral part of an aid financed by a tax depends not on the existence of a competitive relationship between the person liable to pay the tax and the beneficiary of the aid, but only on whether that tax is hypothecated to the aid in question under the relevant national legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 December 2008, Régie Networks, C‑333/07, EU:C:2008:764, paragraphs 93 to 99).",prem,"['court have hold ', ' finance tax', 'question depend number', 'question depend existence', ' to pay tax', 'tax be hypothecate aid', 'tax be hypothecate legislation', ' see effect']"
"Thus, according to the case-law of the Court, a tax cannot be hypothecated to an exemption from payment of that same tax for a category of undertakings, and thus even where those undertakings operate in competition with undertakings liable to pay the tax in question.",prem,"[' accord law', 'tax can be not hypothecate exemption', 'undertaking operate petition', 'undertaking operate undertaking', ' to pay tax']"
The application of a tax exemption and its extent do not depend on the tax revenue.,prem,['number depend revenue']
"Thus, those liable to pay a charge cannot rely on the argument that the exemption enjoyed by other undertakings constitutes State aid in order to avoid payment of that charge or to obtain reimbursement thereof (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 27 October 2005, Distribution Casino France and Others, C‑266/04 to C‑270/04, C‑276/04 and C‑321/04 to C‑325/04, EU:C:2005:657, paragraphs 41 and 42).",prem,"[' to pay charge', 'those can not rely argument', ' enjoy company', 'exemption stitute aid', ' to avoid payment', ' to obtain reimbursement', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"On the other hand, as has already been stated in paragraph 65 of the present judgment, taxes are not, in principle, subject to the rules on State aid.",prem,[' have be state paragraph']
"As noted by the Advocate General in point 96 of his Opinion, DTS’s argument, if followed, would lead to the conclusion that any tax levied at sectoral level and imposed on undertakings in competition with the beneficiary of the aid financed by the tax must be examined under Articles 107 and 108 TFEU.",prem,"[' e general', ' e point', 'argument would lead clusion', ' levy level', ' impose undertaking', ' finance tax', 'tax must be examine tfeu']"
It follows from the foregoing that the General Court did not err in law in holding that the tax on pay-television operators is not part of the aid scheme benefiting RTVE.,prem,"['it follow forego', 'court do number', 'court do law', ' benefit rtve']"
It should be noted that the third ground of appeal rests entirely on the premiss that the General Court misinterpreted the scope of the second plea for annulment raised at first instance alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU.,prem,"['ground rest premiss', 'court misinterpret scope', ' raise instance', ' allege infringement']"
"It should be noted, however, that, by its appeal, DTS does not dispute any of the assessments made by the General Court, in paragraphs 113 to 167 of the judgment under appeal, in order to justify the rejection of that second plea.",prem,"['dts do dispute any', ' make court', ' make paragraph', ' make appeal', ' to justify rejection']"
"In particular, DTS in no way claims that that part of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by errors of law;",prem,"['dts claim ', 'part be vitiate error']"
it states at the outset that its appeal does not relate to the review of the compatibility of the aid granted to RTVE with Article 106(2) TFEU.,prem,"['it state outset', 'appeal do relate review']"
"It follows that the third ground of appeal, even if it were founded, is in no way capable of leading to the annulment of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['it follow ', 'it be found ', ' lead annulment', ' lead appeal']"
"In their reply, the Telefónica companies raised a plea alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in which they submit that the General Court erred in law in rejecting as inadmissible their argument relating to the infringement of Article 108 TFEU.",prem,"['panie raise plea', ' allege infringement', 'they submit ', 'court err law', ' reject argument', ' relate infringement']"
"The Telefónica companies also raised, in that pleading, a plea alleging infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU, in which they argue that the General Court erred in law in conducting an excessively limited review of whether the aid scheme at issue complied with the principle of proportionality, relying in that regard on the Commission’s discretion.",prem,"['panie raise plea', 'panie raise pleading', ' allege infringement', 'they argue ', 'court err law', 'company ply principle', ' rely regard', ' rely discretion']"
It is not disputed that those pleas seek annulment of the judgment under appeal on grounds that were not raised by DTS as part of its appeal.,prem,"['it be dispute ', 'plea seek annulment', 'plea seek appeal', 'plea seek ground', 'that be raise dts', 'that be raise part']"
"On the one hand, DTS did not rely on the infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union in support of its appeal.",prem,"['dts do rely infringement', 'dts do rely support']"
"On the other, although the third ground of appeal formally relies on the infringement of Article 106(2) TFEU, DTS itself stated in its appeal, as is apparent from paragraph 92 of the present judgment, that it is not seeking to challenge the review of the compatibility of the aid granted to RTVE under that provision, merely alleging, as part of that ground of appeal, that the General Court distorted some of its arguments.",prem,"['ground rely infringement', 'dts state appeal', 'it be seek ', ' to challenge review', ' grant provision', ' allege part', 'court distort some']"
"Under Article 174 of the Rules of Procedure, a response shall seek to have the appeal allowed or dismissed, in whole or in part.",prem,"['response shall seek ', 'appeal allow ', 'appeal dismiss ']"
"Furthermore, in accordance with Article 172 of those rules, a party to the relevant case before the General Court may submit, by document separate from the response, a cross-appeal which, according to Article 178(1) and (3), second sentence, of the Rules of Procedure, must seek to have set aside, in whole or in part, the judgment under appeal on the basis of pleas in law and arguments separate from those relied on in the response.",prem,"['party may submit cross', 'party may submit -', 'party may submit appeal', 'party may submit document', ' accord article', 'which must seek ', ' to have set judgment', ' to have set whole', ' to have set basis', ' rely response']"
"It is apparent from those provisions, read together, that the reply may not seek the annulment of the judgment under appeal on the basis of distinct and independent grounds from those raised in the appeal, since such grounds may only be raised as part of a cross-appeal.",prem,"['reply may seek annulment', 'reply may seek appeal', 'reply may seek basis', ' raise appeal', 'ground may be raise part']"
"Regarding the admissibility of the cross-appeal, it should be recalled that, pursuant to the second sentence of Article 178(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the pleas and legal arguments put forward in support of a cross-appeal must, as already stated in paragraph 100 of the present judgment, be distinct from those relied on in the reply relating to the appeal in the main proceedings.",prem,"[' regard admissibility', 'it should be recall ', ' put support', ' must state paragraph', ' rely reply', ' relate appeal', ' relate proceeding']"
"In the present case, it appears that, admittedly, the single plea raised by the Telefónica companies in support of their cross-appeal, alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, corresponds exactly to one of the arguments raised in the reply to the appeal in the main proceedings brought by DTS.",prem,"['it appear ', ' raise company', 'plea panie support', ' allege infringement', 'company respond one', ' raise reply', ' bring dts']"
"However, under penalty of falling foul of the distinction made by the Rules of Procedure between the appeal in the main proceedings and the cross-appeal, the requirement laid down by the second sentence of Article 178(3) of those rules may be understood only as being based on the premiss that the pleas and arguments set out in the reply are, themselves, analogous to those raised in the appeal in the main proceedings.",prem,"[' make rules', ' lay sentence', ' lay rule', 'requirement may be understand ', ' be base premiss', ' set reply', ' raise appeal', ' raise proceeding']"
"In the present case, as is apparent from paragraphs 95 to 102 of the present judgment, the plea put forward by the Telefónica companies in their reply relating to the appeal in the main proceedings brought by DTS, alleging infringement of Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, is inadmissible because it is distinct from those of the appeal.",prem,"[' put company', ' relate appeal', ' relate proceeding', ' bring dts', ' allege infringement']"
"As regards compliance with the requirement laid down by the first sentence of Article 178(3) of the Rules of Procedure, it is sufficient to note that the cross-appeal expressly refers to paragraphs 207 to 218 of the judgment under appeal and, therefore, that it does clearly identify the grounds of that judgment which are in dispute.",prem,"[' regard pliance', ' lay sentence', 'cross refer paragraph', '- refer paragraph', 'appeal refer paragraph', 'it do identify ground']"
"With respect to whether the cross-appeal is well founded, it should be recalled that a party who, pursuant to Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, is granted leave to intervene in a case submitted to the Court may not alter the subject matter of the dispute as defined by the forms of order sought and the pleas in law raised by the main parties.",prem,"['cross be found ', '- be found ', 'it should be recall ', 'who be grant leave', ' to intervene case', ' submit court', 'party may alter matter', ' define form', ' raise party']"

"It is not disputed that DTS did not rely on the infringement of that provision in support of its action at first instance, since the three pleas it relied on in order to seek annulment of the contested decision alleged the infringement, respectively, of Article 107 TFEU, Articles 49 and 64 TFEU and Article 106(2) TFEU.",prem,"['it be dispute ', 'dts do rely infringement', 'dts do rely support', 'dts do rely instance', 'it rely ', ' to seek annulment', 'plea allege infringement']"
"It follows that, as the General Court held in paragraph 212 of the judgment under appeal, the pleas put forward by the Telefónica companies in its statement in intervention before the General Court were wholly unconnected with the subject matter of the dispute as it had been defined by DTS and altered the framework of the dispute to a degree which was contrary to Article 40 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.",prem,"['it follow ', 'court hold paragraph', ' put company', 'it have be define dts', 'plea alter framework', 'plea alter degree']"

"It follows that, as the General Court correctly held in paragraph 217 of the judgment under appeal, in the context of such proceedings, the Court must make all the necessary determinations in order to reach a finding of a failure to fulfil obligations, with the result that a plea in defence, raised by an intervener, which relates to an element of fact or law that the Commission must necessarily take account of in its analysis is not capable of altering the framework of the dispute, even if it was not relied on by the Member State concerned.",prem,"['it follow ', 'company hold paragraph', 'court must make determination', 'court must make result', ' to reach finding', ' to fulfil obligation', ' raise intervener', 'which relate element', 'commission must take account', 'commission must take analysis', ' alter framework', 'it be rely company']"

"As noted by the Advocate General in point 219 of his Opinion, that provision falls within the context of the limits established by the intervention procedure and must be read in the light of Article 129 of that regulation, which states that the intervention is to be limited to supporting, in whole or in part, the form of order sought by one of the parties, that it is ancillary to the main proceedings and that the intervener must accept the case as he finds it at the time of his intervention.",prem,"[' e general', ' e point', 'provision fall text', ' establish procedure', 'provision must be read light', 'which state ', ' support form', ' support whole', ' seek one', 'intervener must accept case', 'he find it', 'he find time']"
