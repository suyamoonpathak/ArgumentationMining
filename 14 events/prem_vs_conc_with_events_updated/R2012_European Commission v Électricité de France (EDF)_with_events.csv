"The Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola claim, in essence, that, in examining whether the private investor test was applicable in the circumstances, the General Court took into account, for that purpose, the objective pursued by the French State when it adopted the contested measure;",prem,"['commission claim essence', 'court take objective', 'court take account', 'court take purpose', ' pursue state', 'it adopt measure']"
"secondly, it confused the roles of the State as shareholder and the State exercising its powers of taxation;",prem,"['it fuse role', 'state exercise power']"
"thirdly, it acted in breach of the principle of equal treatment as between public and private undertakings;",prem,['it act breach']
"and, fourthly, it infringed the rules regarding allocation of the burden of proof.",prem,"['it infringe rule', ' regard allocation']"
"According to case-law, a measure granted through State resources which puts the recipient undertaking in a more favourable financial situation than that of its competitors and which, for that reason, distorts or threatens to distort competition and affects trade between Member States is not excluded outright from being categorised as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 87 EC because of the aims pursued by that State (see, to that effect, Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 15; Case C-156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I-6857, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited; and Joined Cases C-71/09 P, C-73/09 P and C-76/09 P Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission [2011] ECR I-4727, paragraph 94 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' accord law', ' grant resource', 'which put undertaking', 'which put situation', 'which distort ', 'which threaten ', ' to distort petition', 'which affect trade', ' exclude aim', ' be categorise aid', ' be categorise purpose', ' pursue state', ' see effect']"
"Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects (Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission, paragraph 94 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['ec do distinguish measure', 'ec do distinguish reference', 'ec define they', 'ec define paragraph', 'ec define relation']"
"However, it is also clear from settled case-law that the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 87 EC are not met if the recipient public undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, obtain the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources.",prem,"['measure must meet ', ' to be treat aid', ' to be treat purpose', 'dition be meet ', 'company respond dition', 'ld obtain advantage', 'which have be make available', 'which have be make resource']"
"In the case of public undertakings, that assessment is made by applying, in principle, the private investor test (see, to that effect, Case C-303/88 Italy v Commission [1991] ECR I-1433, paragraph 20; Case C-482/99 France v Commission [2002] ECR I-4397, paragraphs 68 to 70; and Comitato ‘Venezia vuole vivere’ and Others v Commission, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['assessment be make ', ' apply see', ' apply case', ' apply principle', ' apply effect']"
"In particular, it is clear from case-law that, in order to assess whether the same measure would have been adopted in normal market conditions by a private investor in a situation as close as possible to that of the State, only the benefits and obligations linked to the situation of the State as shareholder — to the exclusion of those linked to its situation as a public authority — are to be taken into account (see, to that effect, Case 234/84 Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2263, paragraph 14; Case 40/85 Belgium v Commission [1986] ECR 2321, paragraph 13; Joined Cases C-278/92 to C-280/92 Spain v Commission [1994] ECR I-4103, paragraph 22; and Case C-334/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I-1139, paragraph 134).",prem,"['measure would have be adopt number', 'measure would have be adopt dition', 'measure would have be adopt investor', 'measure would have be adopt situation', ' link situation', ' link exclusion', ' link situation', ' to be take account', ' see case', ' see effect']"
"It follows that the roles of the State as shareholder of an undertaking, on the one hand, and of the State acting as a public authority, on the other, must be distinguished , as has been correctly argued by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola and as the General Court held in paragraphs 223 to 228 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['it follow ', ' act authority', 'role must be distinguish ', ' have be argue commission', 'court hold paragraph']"
"The applicability of the private investor test ultimately depends, therefore, on the Member State concerned having conferred, in its capacity as shareholder and not in its capacity as public authority, an economic advantage on an undertaking belonging to it.",prem,"['applicability depend ', 'company have ', ' ferre advantage', ' ferre capacity', ' belong it']"
"It follows that, if a Member State relies on that test during the administrative procedure, it must, where there is doubt, establish unequivocally and on the basis of objective and verifiable evidence that the measure implemented falls to be ascribed to the State acting as shareholder .",prem,"['it follow ', 'state rely test', 'state rely procedure', 'there be doubt', 'it must establish basis', 'measure fall ', ' to be ascribe state', ' act shareholder']"
"That evidence must show clearly that, before or at the same time as conferring the economic advantage (see, to that effect, France v Commission, paragraphs 71 and 72), the Member State concerned took the decision to make an investment, by means of the measure actually implemented, in the public undertaking.",prem,"['evidence must show ', ' ferre advantage', 'company see france', 'company see effect', 'company take decision', ' to make investment', ' to make mean']"
"In that regard, it may be necessary to produce evidence showing that the decision is based on economic evaluations comparable to those which, in the circumstances, a rational private investor in a situation as close as possible to that of the Member State would have had carried out, before making the investment, in order to determine its future profitability.",prem,"[' to produce evidence', 'decision be base evaluation', 'investor would have have carry ', ' make investment', ' to determine profitability']"
"By contrast, for the purposes of showing that, before or at the same time as conferring the advantage, the Member State took that decision as a shareholder, it is not enough to rely on economic evaluations made after the advantage was conferred, on a retrospective finding that the investment made by the Member State concerned was actually profitable, or on subsequent justifications of the course of action actually chosen (see, to that effect, France v Commission, paragraphs 71 and 72).",prem,"['company ferre advantage', 'state take decision', 'state take shareholder', ' to rely evaluation', 'advantage be ferre ', ' make company', ' see effect']"
"If the Member State concerned provides the Commission with the requisite evidence, it is for the Commission to carry out a global assessment, taking into account — in addition to the evidence provided by that Member State — all other relevant evidence enabling it to determine whether the Member State took the measure in question in its capacity as shareholder or as a public authority .",prem,"['company provide commission', 'company provide evidence', 'commission to carry assessment', ' take evidence', ' take account', ' take addition', ' provide state', ' enable it', 'state take measure', 'state take capacity']"
"In particular, as the General Court held in paragraph 229 of the judgment under appeal, the nature and subject-matter of that measure are relevant in that regard, as is its context, the objective pursued and the rules to which the measure is subject.",prem,['court hold paragraph']
"Accordingly, in the circumstances of the case, the General Court was right to hold that the objective pursued by the French State could be taken into account, in the context of the requisite global assessment, for the purposes of determining whether the State had indeed acted in its capacity as shareholder and whether, as a consequence, the private investor test was applicable in the present case.",prem,"[' pursue company', 'objective be take account', 'objective be take text', 'objective be take purpose', 'state have act capacity']"
"As regards the question whether the applicability of the private investor test could be ruled out in the present case simply because the means employed by the French State were fiscal, it should be recalled that, under Article 87(1) EC, any aid granted through State resources — in any form whatsoever — which, in terms of its effects, distorts or threatens to distort competition is incompatible with the common market in so far as it affects trade between Member States (see Case C-156/98 Germany v Commission, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).",prem,"[' regard question', 'applicability be rule case', ' employ state', 'it should be recall ', ' grant resource', 'which distort ', 'which threaten ', ' to distort petition', 'it affect trade', ' see case', ' see law']"
"Moreover, it has been noted in paragraph 78 above that the private investor test is applied in order to determine whether, because of its effects, the economic advantage granted, in whatever form, through State resources to a public undertaking distorts or threatens to distort competition and affects trade between Member States .",prem,"['it have be e paragraph', 'test be apply ', ' grant form', ' grant resource', 'advantage distort ', 'advantage threaten ', ' to distort petition', ' affect trade']"
"The intention underlying Article 87(1) EC and the private investor test is thus to prevent the recipient public undertaking from being placed, by means of State resources, in a more favourable position than that of its competitors (see, to that effect, Case C-387/92 Banco Exterior de España [1994] ECR I-877, paragraph 14, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission, paragraph 16).",prem,"[' underlie ec', ' to prevent undertaking', ' be place mean', ' be place position', ' see case', ' see effect']"
"However, the financial situation of the recipient public undertaking depends not on the means used to place it at an advantage, however that may have been effected, but on the amount that the undertaking ultimately receives.",prem,"['situation depend mean', ' to place it', ' to place advantage', 'that may have be effect ', 'undertaking receive ']"
"Consequently, when considering whether the private investor test was applicable, the General Court did not err in law by focusing its analysis, not on the fiscal nature of the means employed by the French State, but on the improvement — with a view to the opening up of the electricity market — in EDF’s financial situation and on the effects of the measure in question on competition .",prem,"['company sidere ', 'court do number', ' focus analysis', ' focus nature', ' employ state']"
"Accordingly, it follows from all of the foregoing that, in view of the objectives underlying Article 87(1) EC and the private investor test, an economic advantage must — even where it has been granted through fiscal means — be assessed inter alia in the light of the private investor test, if, on conclusion of the global assessment that may be required, it appears that, notwithstanding the fact that the means used were instruments of State power, the Member State concerned conferred that advantage in its capacity as shareholder of the undertaking belonging to it .",prem,"['it follow all', ' underlie ec', 'it have be grant mean', 'advantage must be assess light', 'that may be require ', 'it appear ', ' withstand fact', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre capacity', ' belong it']"
"It follows that the finding made by the General Court in paragraph 250 of the judgment under appeal, to the effect that the obligation for the Commission to verify whether capital was provided by the State in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions exists regardless of the way in which that capital was provided by the State, is not vitiated by an error of law.",prem,"['it follow ', ' make court', ' make paragraph', 'commission to verify ', 'capital be provide state', 'capital be provide circumstance', 'company respond dition', 'obligation exist ', 'capital be provide state', ' be vitiate error']"
"As regards the argument, put forward by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola, that a private investor would not have been able in comparable circumstances to make an investment such as that made by the French State, since it would have had to pay the tax and since only that State, as tax authority, could still have had at its disposal sums corresponding to that tax, it should be noted, first, that in respect of the accounting transaction in question, it is the private undertaking in EDF’s situation which would have had to pay the tax, not its shareholder.",prem,"[' regard argument', ' put commission', ' to make investment', ' make state', 'it would have have ', ' to pay tax', 'state have have disposal', 'company respond tax', 'it be e ', 'which would have have ', ' to pay tax', ' number shareholder']"
"In the present case, therefore, application of the private investor test would have made it possible to determine whether, in similar circumstances, a private shareholder would have subscribed, to an undertaking in a situation comparable with that of EDF, an amount equal to the tax due.",prem,"['application would have make ', 'shareholder would have subscribe amount', 'shareholder would have subscribe undertaking']"
"Secondly, as the General Court pointed out in paragraphs 275 and 276 of the judgment under appeal, the possibility that there might be a difference between the cost to the private investor and the cost to the State as investor does not preclude application of the private investor test.",prem,"['court point paragraph', 'possibility do preclude application']"
"Rather, that test makes it possible to address precisely that point, that is to say, to establish, inter alia, that such a difference exists and to take it into account when assessing whether the conditions laid down by that test are met.",prem,"['test make ', ' to address point', 'difference exist ', ' to take it', ' to take account', ' lay test', 'dition be meet ']"
"It follows that — contrary to the assertions made by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola — the analysis carried out by the General Court is not inconsistent with the principle of equal treatment between public and private undertakings;",prem,"['it follow ', ' make commission', ' carry court']"
it does not cause distortion of competition;,prem,['it do cause distortion']
and it does not go against the objective pursued by the private investor test.,prem,"['it do go objective', ' pursue test']"
"Accordingly, in finding that the private investor test may be applicable even where fiscal means have been employed, the General Court did not err in law.",prem,['mean have be employ ']
"It should be added that, by the judgment under appeal, the General Court did not prejudge the applicability of that test to the present case;",prem,"['it should be add ', 'court do prejudge applicability']"
"nor, as was noted in paragraph 283 of that judgment, did the General Court prejudge the outcome of applying that test.",prem,"['court do prejudge outcome', ' apply test']"
"In particular, by merely verifying whether the applicability of the private investor test could be ruled out simply because the means employed by the French State were fiscal, the General Court in no way adopted an analysis tantamount to authorising the Member States to take into account, when applying that test, the advantages and obligations linked to their status as a public authority or factors which are subjective and open to manipulation.",prem,"['applicability be rule ', ' employ state', 'court adopt analysis', ' authorise states', ' to take advantage', ' to take account', ' apply test', ' link status']"
"As to the question whether, in the present case, it was necessary to define a reference investor, it should be noted that the case-law relied upon in that regard by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola concerns a situation marked by the impossibility of comparing the position of a public undertaking operating in a reserved sector with that of a private undertaking not operating in a reserved sector (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-83/01 P, C-93/01 P and C-94/01 P Chronopost and Others v Ufex and Others [2003] ECR I-6993, paragraph 38).",prem,"[' to define investor', 'law rely regard', 'law rely commission', 'company pare position', 'company pare that', ' operate sector', ' operate sector', 'that see cases', 'that see effect']"
"As it is, the argument put forward by the Commission, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and Iberdrola is not that it is impossible to compare EDF’s situation with that of a private undertaking operating in sectors identical to those in which EDF operates.",prem,"[' put commission', ' to pare situation', ' to pare that', ' operate sector', 'edf operate ']"
"Moreover, it follows from the same line of authority that, for the purposes of such a comparison, an assessment must be carried out by reference to the objective and verifiable evidence which is available.",prem,"['it follow line', 'assessment must be carry reference']"
"Furthermore, contrary to the assertions made by the Commission and the EFTA Surveillance Authority, the private investor test is not an exception which applies only if a Member State so requests, in situations characterised by all the constituent elements of State aid incompatible with the common market, as laid down in Article 87(1) EC.",prem,"[' make commission', 'which apply situation', 'state request ', ' characterise element', ' lay ec']"
"It follows from paragraph 78 above that, where it is applicable, that test is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing the existence of such aid.",prem,"['it follow paragraph', 'commission be require ', ' to take account', ' to take purpose', ' establish existence']"
"Consequently, where it appears that the private investor test could be applicable, the Commission is under a duty to ask the Member State concerned to provide it with all relevant information enabling it to determine whether the conditions governing the applicability and the application of that test are met, and it cannot refuse to examine that information unless the evidence produced has been established after the adoption of the decision to make the investment in question.",prem,"['it appear ', ' to ask company', ' to provide it', ' to provide information', ' enable it', ' govern applicability', 'dition be meet ', 'it can not refuse ', ' to examine information', 'evidence have be establish adoption', ' to make investment', ' to make question']"
"It has already been noted in paragraphs 83 to 85 above that, for the purposes of applying the private investor test, the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the decision to make the investment was taken.",prem,"['it e paragraph', ' apply test', ' to make investment', 'decision be take ']"
"That is especially so where, as in the present case, the Commission is seeking to determine whether there has been State aid in relation to an investment which was not notified to it and which, at the time when the Commission carries out its examination, has already been made by the Member State concerned.",prem,"['commission be seek ', ' ifie it', 'commission carry examination', 'which have be make ']"
"The Commission submits, in essence, that the General Court distorted the evidence in finding that, by the measure at issue, the French Republic converted a tax claim into capital.",prem,"['commission submit essence', 'court distort evidence', 'company verte claim', 'company verte capital']"
"The Commission claims that, by that measure, the French Republic granted EDF an exemption from corporation tax and that, in the case of a tax exemption, the private investor test is not relevant.",prem,"['commission claim ', 'republic grant exemption']"
"However, in the course of considering the second ground of appeal, it has been found that, where a Member State confers an economic advantage upon an undertaking belonging to it, the fiscal nature of the process used to grant that advantage does not mean that the applicability of the private investor test can automatically be ruled out.",prem,"['it have be find ', 'company fer advantage', 'company fer undertaking', ' belong it', ' to grant advantage', 'nature do mean ', 'applicability can be rule ']"
"It follows, a fortiori, that the precise modus operandi chosen by the Member State is irrelevant for the purposes of assessing whether that test applies.",prem,"['it follow ', ' choose state', 'test apply ']"
"In those circumstances, even if it were established, the alleged distortion of the facts would not, in any event, be such as to affect the soundness of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['it be establish ', 'distortion would number event', ' to affect soundness']"
"In the light of all the foregoing, the second ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,['ground must be reject ']
It follows that the first ground of appeal must be rejected as ineffective.,conc,"['it follow ', 'ground must be reject ']"
