"It must be observed at the outset that, as the Advocate General stated in point 47 of his Opinion, the requirement as to selectivity under Article 107(1) TFEU must be clearly distinguished from the concomitant detection of an economic advantage, in that, where the Commission has identified an advantage, understood in a broad sense, as arising directly or indirectly from a particular measure, it is also required to establish that that advantage specifically benefits one or more undertakings.",prem,"['it must be observe outset', 'general state point', 'requirement must be distinguish detection', 'commission have identify advantage', ' understand sense', ' arise measure', 'it be require ', 'advantage benefit undertaking']"
"It falls to the Commission to show that the measure, in particular, creates differences between undertakings which, with regard to the objective of the measure, are in a comparable situation.",prem,"['it fall commission', 'measure create difference']"
It is necessary therefore that the advantage be granted selectively and that it be liable to place certain undertakings in a more favourable situation than that of others.,prem,"['advantage be grant ', ' to place undertaking', ' to place situation']"
"It must, however, be noted that the selectivity requirement differs depending on whether the measure in question is envisaged as a general scheme of aid or as individual aid.",prem,"['requirement differ ', 'measure be envisage scheme']"
"In the latter case, the identification of the economic advantage is, in principle, sufficient to support the presumption that it is selective.",prem,[' to support presumption']
"By contrast, when examining a general scheme of aid, it is necessary to identify whether the measure in question, notwithstanding the finding that it confers an advantage of general application, does so to the exclusive benefit of certain undertakings or certain sectors of activity .",prem,"[' examine scheme', ' withstand finding', 'it fer advantage', 'measure do benefit']"
"It follows that the appropriate comparator for establishing the selectivity of the measure at issue in the present case was to ascertain whether the procedure for concluding and setting the terms and conditions of the agreement extending mining rights, laid down in Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act, draws a distinction between operators that are, in the light of the objective of the measure, in a comparable factual and legal situation, a distinction not justified by the nature and general scheme of the system at issue .",prem,"['it follow ', ' establish selectivity', 'company set term', ' extend right', ' lay article', 'procedure draw distinction', ' justify nature']"
"It follows from those considerations that the present case must be clearly distinguished from those cases giving rise to the case-law mentioned by the Commission in support of its arguments, set out in paragraphs 54 and 56 above, seeking to criticise the analysis made by the General Court of the legal framework governing the 2005 agreement.",prem,"['it follow sideration', 'case must be distinguish case', ' give rise', ' give law', ' mention commission', ' mention support', ' set paragraph', ' to criticise analysis', ' make court', ' govern agreement']"
"Those cases relate to provisions of national law granting relief on taxes or other charges (judgments in France v Commission, C‑241/94, EU:C:1996:353; Piaggio, C‑295/97, EU:C:1999:313; DM Transport, C‑256/97, EU:C:1999:332; P, C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525; Ministerio de Defensa and Navantia, C‑522/13, EU:C:2014:2262; and British Telecommunications v Commission, C‑620/13 P, EU:C:2014:2309), or exceptions in matters of insolvency (judgment in Ecotrade, C‑200/97, EU:C:1998:579).",prem,"['case relate provision', ' grant relief']"
"As the Advocate General stated in point 86 of his Opinion, there is a fundamental difference between, on the one hand, the assessment of the selectivity of general schemes for exemption or relief, which, by definition, confer an advantage, and, on the other, the assessment of the selectivity of optional provisions of national law prescribing the imposition of additional charges.",prem,"['general state point', 'there be difference', ' prescribe imposition']"
"In cases in which the national authorities impose such charges in order to maintain equal treatment between operators, the simple fact that those authorities enjoy discretion defined by law, and not unlimited, as the Commission claimed in its appeal, cannot be sufficient to establish that the corresponding scheme is selective .",prem,"['authority impose charge', ' to maintain treatment', 'authority enjoy discretion', ' define law', 'commission claim appeal']"
"Consequently, it must be stated, first, that the General Court correctly held in paragraph 72 of the judgment under appeal that the margin of assessment at issue in the present case allows the fixing of an additional charge imposed on economic operators in order to take account of the imperatives arising from the principle of equal treatment, and can be distinguished, by its very nature, from cases in which the exercise of such a margin is connected with the grant of an advantage in favour of a specific economic operator.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'company hold paragraph', 'margin allow fixing', ' impose operator', ' to take account', ' to take imperative', ' arise principle', 'margin can be distinguish nature', 'margin can be distinguish case', 'exercise be necte grant']"
"Secondly, it cannot validly be argued that the General Court erred in law by finding, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal that the fact that the rates set by year of validity of the 2005 agreement are the result of negotiation does not suffice to confer on that agreement a selective character, and that the situation would have been different only if the Hungarian authorities had exercised their margin of assessment in such a way as to favour MOL by agreeing to a low fee level without any objective reason having regard to the rationale of increasing fees in the event of an extension of authorisation and to the detriment of any other operator having sought to extend its mining rights or, if there is no such operator, where there is concrete evidence that unjustified favourable treatment has been reserved to MOL.",prem,"['it can be not argue ', 'court err law', ' find paragraph', ' set year', 'fact do suffice ', 'authority have exercise margin', 'authority have exercise way', ' to favour mol', ' agree level', ' agree reason', ' have regard', ' increase fee', ' increase event', ' to extend right', 'there be operator', 'there be evidence', 'treatment have be reserve mol']"
"In addition, in order to determine whether the selective nature of the 2005 agreement had been demonstrated by the Commission, the General Court first analysed, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, the rates stipulated under that agreement and found that no evidence of unjustified preferential treatment of MOL was apparent from the decision at issue, and that therefore it could not be assumed that MOL was afforded favourable treatment in relation to any other undertaking that was potentially in a situation comparable to its own for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['nature have be demonstrate commission', 'court analyse rate', 'court analyse paragraph', ' stipulate agreement', 'court find ', 'number be assume ', 'mol be afford treatment', 'mol be afford relation', 'mol be afford purpose', ' cite paragraph']"
"Secondly, the General Court found in paragraph 80 of the judgment under appeal that, although the Commission had mentioned that there were other extension agreements in the solid minerals sector, it did not take account of them, and that in doing so it did not take into consideration all the factors by means of which it would have been in a position to assess whether the 2005 agreement was selective as regards MOL in the light of the situation created by other agreements extending mining rights, also concluded on the basis of Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.",prem,"['court find paragraph', 'commission have mention ', 'there be agreement', ' take account', ' take they', 'it do take factor', 'it do take sideration', ' regard mol', ' regard light', ' create agreement', ' extend right', ' clude basis']"
"Following the analysis carried out in paragraphs 70 to 74 and 79 to 80 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court was right to conclude, in paragraph 81 of that judgment, that, in the light, first, of the absence of selectivity characterising the legal framework governing the conclusion of agreements extending mining rights and given the considerations justifying the grant of a margin of assessment, and secondly, of the absence of any evidence that those authorities treated MOL favourably in relation to any other undertaking in a comparable situation, the selective nature of the 2005 agreement cannot be regarded as established.",prem,"[' follow analysis', ' carry paragraph', ' characterise framework', ' govern clusion', ' extend right', ' give sideration', ' justify grant', 'authority treat mol', 'authority treat relation', 'authority treat situation', 'nature can be not regard ']"
"In the light of all the above considerations, it must be held that the General Court did not err in law in its examination, in paragraphs 70 to 74 and 79 to 81 of the judgment under appeal, of the legal framework governing the conclusion of the 2005 agreement.",prem,"['it must be hold ', ' govern clusion']"
"It must be stated that, in paragraphs 76 to 78 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court analysed the legal framework governing the conclusion of agreements extending mining rights, including the 2005 agreement, as provided for in Article 26/A(5) of the Mining Act.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'court analyse framework', ' govern clusion', ' extend right', ' include agreement', ' provide article']"
"In order to do so, the General Court examined whether or not the mining fee rate was set on the basis of objective criteria applicable to any potentially interested operator.",prem,"['court examine ', 'rate be set basis']"
"Thus, the General Court noted first, in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal, that the Mining Act was drafted in general terms as regards the undertakings eligible for the extension of mining rights.",prem,"['act be draft term', ' regard undertaking']"
"Next, the General Court found, in paragraph 77 of that judgment, that the fact that MOL was the only undertaking to have concluded an extension agreement in the hydrocarbons sector did not necessarily constitute evidence of selectivity, since the criteria for concluding such an agreement are objective and applicable to any potentially interested operator, and the absence of other agreements may result from decisions by undertakings themselves not to apply for an extension of mining rights.",prem,"['court find paragraph', 'company clude agreement', 'company clude sector', 'fact do number evidence', 'company clude agreement', 'absence may result decision', ' to apply extension']"
"Lastly, the General Court stated, in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, that the mining fees set for the term of the 2005 agreement stem simply from the application of the provisions of the Mining Act .",prem,"['court state paragraph', ' set term', 'fee stem application']"
"It follows from those arguments that, in criticising the General Court for holding that the presence of objective criteria necessarily rules out any possibility of selectivity and for having consequently disregarded the case-law to the effect that a particular aid scheme cannot be cleared of being selective solely on the ground that the beneficiaries are selected on the basis of objective criteria (judgments in Spain v Commission, C‑409/00, EU:C:2003:92, paragraph 49, and GEMO, C‑126/01, EU:C:2003:622, paragraphs 35 and 39), the Commission misreads the judgment under appeal.",prem,"['it follow argument', ' criticise court', 'presence rule possibility', 'company disregard law', 'company disregard effect', 'scheme can be not clear ground', 'beneficiary be select basis', 'commission misread judgment', 'commission misread appeal']"
"In any event, it must be stated that, as MOL contends, in the cases giving rise to those judgments, the Court of Justice addressed the issue of whether or not the beneficiaries of State aid schemes were selected on the basis of objective criteria.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'company tend ', ' give rise', ' give judgment', 'court address issue', 'beneficiary be select basis']"
"Thus, in particular in the judgment in GEMO (C‑126/01, EU:C:2003:622), the Court found that, despite the fact that the beneficiaries of the scheme adopted by national law were defined on the basis of objective and apparently general criteria, the benefits of that law accrued largely to farmers and slaughterhouses .",prem,"['court find ', ' adopt law', 'beneficiary be define basis', 'benefit accrue farmer']"
"As the Advocate General stated in point 91 of his Opinion, that issue is not in question in the present case, so that the case-law arising from those judgments is not relevant in these proceedings.",prem,"['general state point', ' arise judgment']"
"As a preliminary point, it must be stated that, in paragraphs 62 and 63 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court observed that the contested measure consists of two elements, namely, the 2005 agreement and the 2008 amendment, and found that that agreement did not involve any element of State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'court observe ', 'company test sist', 'court find ', 'agreement do involve element', 'agreement do involve purpose']"
"In that context, the General Court first of all held, in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, that, where a Member State concludes with an economic operator an agreement which does not involve any element of State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU, the fact that, subsequently, conditions external to such an agreement change in such a way that the operator in question is in an advantageous position vis-à-vis other operators that have not concluded a similar agreement is not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that, together, the agreement and the subsequent modification of the conditions external to that agreement can be regarded as constituting State aid .",prem,"['court hold paragraph', 'company clude agreement', 'company clude operator', 'which do involve element', 'which do involve purpose', 'dition change way', 'that have number ', ' clude agreement', 'agreement can be regard aid']"
"Next, the General Court made it clear, in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, that, if that were not the case, any agreement that an economic operator might conclude with a State which does not involve any element of State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU would always be open to challenge, when the situation on the market on which the operator party to the agreement is active evolves in such a way that an advantage is conferred on that operator, as described in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, or when the State exercises its regulatory power in an objectively justified manner following a market evolution while observing the rights and obligations resulting from such an agreement.",prem,"['court make paragraph', 'operator might clude state', 'which do involve element', 'which do involve purpose', 'situation evolve way', 'advantage be ferre operator', ' describe paragraph', 'state exercise power', 'state exercise manner', 'state exercise evolution', ' follow evolution', ' observe right', ' result agreement']"
"Finally, the General Court held in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal that a combination of elements such as that observed by the Commission in the decision at issue may be categorised as State aid where the terms of the agreement concluded were proposed selectively by the State to one or more operators rather than on the basis of objective criteria, laid down by a text of general application, applicable to any operator.",prem,"['court hold paragraph', ' observe commission', ' observe decision', 'bination may be categorise aid', 'term be propose state', 'term be propose operator', ' lay text']"
"The General Court made it clear in that regard that the fact that only one operator concluded an agreement of that type is not sufficient to establish the selective nature of the agreement, since that may result from, inter alia, lack of interest on the part of any other operator.",prem,"['court make ', 'company clude agreement', ' to establish nature', 'that may result lack']"
"Moreover, the General Court stated, in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal, that the case-law of the Court of Justice, according to which, for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU, a single aid measure may consist of combined elements on condition that, having regard to their chronology, their purpose and the circumstances of the undertaking at the time of their intervention, they are so closely linked to each other that they are inseparable from one another (judgment in Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission and Others and Commission v France and Others, C‑399/10 P and C‑401/10 P, EU:C:2013:175, paragraphs 103 and 104 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'measure may sist element', ' have regard']"
"In that context, the General Court emphasised, in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal, that a combination of elements such as that relied upon by the Commission in the decision at issue may be categorised as State aid when the State acts in such a way as to protect one or more operators already present on the market, by concluding with them an agreement granting them fee rates guaranteed for the entire duration of that agreement, while having the intention at that time of subsequently exercising its regulatory power, by increasing the fee rate so that other market operators are placed at a disadvantage, be they operators already present on the market on the date on which that agreement was concluded or new operators.",prem,"['court emphasise paragraph', ' rely commission', ' rely decision', 'bination may be categorise aid', 'state act way', ' to protect operator', ' clude agreement', ' clude they', ' grant rate', ' guarantee duration', ' have intention', ' have time', ' exercise power', ' increase rate', 'operator be place disadvantage', 'agreement be clude ']"
"It was in the light of those considerations that the General Court, in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, decided that it was necessary to examine whether, in those proceedings, the Commission was entitled to consider that the contested measure was selective.",prem,['court decide ']
"It follows from the foregoing that, as MOL contends, paragraphs 64 to 67 of the judgment under appeal do not, as such, concern the examination of the selectivity of the 2005 agreement, but are preliminary explanations aimed at introducing the relevant framework in relation to which the General Court examined whether the Commission was correct in finding that the measure at issue was selective.",prem,"['it follow forego', 'company tend ', 'paragraph do number examination', ' introduce framework', 'court examine ']"
"As the Advocate General stated in points 107 and 114 of his Opinion, by those preliminary explanations, the General Court in fact sought to deal with the issue of the links existing between the 2005 agreement and the 2008 amendment, which the Commission had not specifically addressed in the decision at issue, and more particularly, to underline the fact that, given that there is no chronological and/or functional link between those two elements, they cannot be interpreted as constituting a single aid measure.",prem,"['general state point', 'court seek ', ' to deal issue', 'commission have address decision', ' to underline fact', 'there be link', 'they can be not interpret ', 'company stitute measure']"
"By those preliminary explanations, the General Court merely applied the case-law laid down by the Court of Justice in the judgment in Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission and Others and Commission v France and Others (C‑399/10 P and C‑401/10 P, EU:C:2013:175), to which the General Court also expressly referred in paragraph 67 of the judgment under appeal, and according to which, since State interventions take various forms and have to be assessed in relation to their effects, it cannot be excluded that several consecutive measures of State intervention must, for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU, be regarded as a single intervention.",prem,"['court apply law', ' lay court', ' lay judgment', 'court refer paragraph', 'court refer appeal', ' accord which', 'intervention take form', 'intervention have ', ' to be assess relation', 'it can be not exclude ', 'measure must be regard intervention']"
"That could be the case, in particular when consecutive interventions, having regard to their chronology, their purpose and the circumstances of the undertaking at the time of those interventions, are so closely related to each other that they are inseparable from one another.",prem,[' have regard']
"In a similar vein, in paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found, first, that the increase in mining fees, which entered into force in 2008, occurred in a context of an increase of international prices, and secondly, the Commission had not argued that the 2005 agreement had been concluded in anticipation of such an increase, and it therefore concluded that the combination of that agreement and the 2008 amendment could not be categorised as State aid for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU.",prem,"['court find ', 'which enter force', 'which enter 2008', 'increase occur text', 'commission have argue ', 'agreement have be clude anticipation', 'it clude ', 'bination be categorise aid', 'bination be categorise purpose']"
It follows that the General Court’s reasoning in paragraphs 64 to 67 and 82 of the judgment under appeal is not vitiated by any error of law.,prem,"['it follow ', ' vitiate error']"
"In addition, it must be stated that the Commission’s assertion that what is relevant is that, after 8 January 2008, MOL was the only undertaking to enjoy preferential treatment cannot be accepted.",prem,"['it must be state ', ' to enjoy treatment', 'assertion can be not accept ']"
"It is common ground in the present case, as is clear from paragraph 46 of the judgment under appeal, that the question whether the measure at issue is selective in nature was discussed by the parties solely in respect of the 2005 agreement, and not the 2008 amendment.",prem,"['question be discuss party', 'question be discuss respect']"
"The first part of the single ground of appeal must, therefore, be rejected as unfounded.",conc,['part must be reject ']
"Therefore, the second part of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.",conc,['part must be reject ']
"In the light of all of the foregoing, the third and fourth parts of the single ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.",conc,['part must be reject ']
