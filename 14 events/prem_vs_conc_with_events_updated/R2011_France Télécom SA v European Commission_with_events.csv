"With regard to the Commission’s claim that the first ground of appeal is inadmissible, it should be noted that that ground, which forms part of the submissions relating to the existence of State aid, was put forward at first instance in the context of the first and second pleas relied on before the General Court.",prem,"['which form part', ' relate existence', 'ground be put instance', 'ground be put text', ' rely court']"
"As regards whether that ground is well founded, according to settled case-law, the definition of aid is more general than that of a subsidy.",prem,[' accord law']
"It includes not only positive benefits but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (see, Joined Cases C‑78/08 to C‑80/08 Paint Graphos and Others [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it include benefit', 'which mitigate charge', 'which be include budget', 'which have effect']"
"It should also be noted that the concept of advantage that is intrinsic to the classification of a measure as State aid is an objective one, irrespective of the motives of the persons responsible for the measure in question.",prem,[]
"Accordingly, the nature of the objectives pursued by State measures and their grounds of justification have no bearing whatsoever on whether such measures are to be classified as State aid.",prem,"[' pursue measure', 'nature have bear', ' to be classify aid']"
"It is established case-law that Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between the causes or the objectives of State aid, but defines them in relation to their effects (see Case C‑409/00 Spain v Commission [2003] ECR I‑1487, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it be establish ', 'article do distinguish cause', 'article define they', 'article define relation', ' see case']"
"As regards the present case, it should be noted that the tax regime to which FT was subject during the second period under consideration, namely during the years from 1994 to 2002, constituted an exception to the general law regime.",prem,"[' regard case', 'regime stitute exception']"
"In particular, that company benefited from specific tax treatment at national level, characterised by the fact that business tax was calculated on the basis of a weighted average rate, as opposed to the various rates applicable in the different local authorities, whereas the rates to which other undertakings were subject were those voted annually by those authorities.",prem,"['that benefit treatment', ' characterise fact', 'tax be calculate basis', ' oppose rate', ' vote authority']"
"Moreover, FT was subject to a single rate of business tax in its principle place of business, whereas other undertakings were taxed at the different rates voted by the local authorities in the territory within which those undertakings had establishments.",prem,"['undertaking be tax rate', ' vote authority', ' vote territory', 'undertaking have establishment']"
"A rate of 1.9% was also applied to FT, as opposed to the rate of 8% applicable to other undertakings, in respect of management costs.",prem,"['rate be apply ft', 'rate be apply respect', ' oppose rate']"
"As regards the argument relied on in the present appeal that the General Court’s examination of the tax regime at issue should have taken account of a number of variables and extraneous factors, it should be noted that, even though, given the particular characteristics of that regime, the Commission was not in a position to determine in advance for each tax year the precise level of taxation for that year, it is nevertheless accepted that the regime was capable of resulting and in fact resulted – as is apparent from recital 59 of the contested decision and paragraph 225 of the judgment under appeal – in FT’s liability to business tax being lower than it would have been if the general law business tax regime had been applied.",prem,"[' regard argument', ' rely appeal', 'examination should have take account', 'examination should have take number', ' give characteristic', ' to determine level', ' to determine advance', ' to determine year', 'it be accept ', 'it be accept ', 'regime result ', 'regime have be apply ']"
"It should also be noted that, irrespective of the rates of business tax adopted by the local authorities, FT benefited in all circumstances from a reduced rate in respect of management costs.",prem,"['it should be e ', ' adopt authority', 'ft benefit circumstance', 'ft benefit rate', 'ft benefit respect']"
"In those circumstances, the General Court was correct to hold, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, that the finding of the existence of aid depended on a number of ‘circumstances unrelated to’ the special tax regime, such as the fact that the business tax was charged annually and the level of the tax rates voted each year by the authorities in the territory in which FT had establishments.",prem,"[' be to hold paragraph', 'finding depend number', 'tax be charge ', ' vote authority', ' vote territory', 'ft have establishment']"
"Contrary to the French Republic’s and FT’s claims, such circumstances do not in any way preclude the possibility that, even at the time of its adoption, the special tax regime could have been classified as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.",prem,"[' preclude possibility', 'ld have be classify aid', 'ld have be classify purpose']"
"Indeed, it is necessary to make a distinction between, on the one hand, the adoption of an aid scheme, namely in the present case the special tax regime, and, on the other, the grant of annual aid to FT on the basis of that regime, the precise total amount of which depended on certain external factors.",prem,"[' to make distinction', 'amount depend factor']"
"As the Advocate General stated at point 59 of his Opinion, the present case involves a dual categorisation, in which the existence of an advantage is attributable, first, to a fixed element forming part of the special tax regime applied to FT, as opposed to the general law regime, and, second, to a variable element, which depends on factual circumstances, namely the location of premises or land in the various local authorities and the tax rate applicable in those authorities.",prem,"['general state point', 'case involve categorisation', ' form part', ' apply ft', ' oppose regime', 'which depend circumstance']"
"On account of its specific features, as described at paragraph 18 above, the special tax regime could have resulted in FT’s liability to tax being less than it would have been had it been subject to business tax under the general law regime.",prem,"[' describe paragraph', 'ld have result ']"
"The fact that FT’s liability to professional tax was indeed lower as of 1994 is directly attributable to the specific features of the special tax regime applied to it, even though the exact amount of annual aid received by it under that regime depended on certain factors unrelated to the regime.",prem,"[' apply it', ' receive it', ' receive regime', 'amount depend factor']"
"It is also apparent from the structure of the judgment under appeal that paragraph 323 of that judgment, which refers to circumstances unrelated to the special tax regime, concerns only the annual aid granted to FT under the special tax regime.",prem,"['which refer circumstance', ' grant regime']"
"In fact, that paragraph forms part of the analysis of the plea relating to the limitation in time of the Commission’s power to recover unlawful aid.",prem,"['paragraph form part', ' relate limitation', ' to recover aid']"
"The findings of the General Court in connection with that plea can relate only to aid actually received and, therefore, concern only the aid from which FT benefited under the special tax regime.",prem,"['finding can relate aid', 'ft benefit regime']"
"It follows from those considerations that the General Court did not err in law in finding that the special tax regime conferred an advantage on FT for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC, even though the exact amount of aid granted under that regime had to be determined by reference to certain factors unrelated to the regime.",prem,"['it follow sideration', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre ft', 'company ferre purpose', ' grant regime', 'amount have ', ' to be determine reference']"
"At paragraph 201 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the part of the contested decision which found that the aid derived from a tax differential representing the difference between the amount which FT would have had to pay by way of business tax contributions if it had been subject to the tax under the general law and the amount which it was actually charged under the tax regime at issue.",prem,"['court examine part', 'which find ', 'aid derive differential', ' represent difference', 'ft would have have ', ' to pay way', 'it be charge regime']"
"The General Court verified that there was a genuine tax differential at paragraphs 219 to 225 of the judgment, without its findings in that regard being called into question by FT.",prem,"['court verify paragraph', 'there be differential', 'finding be call question', 'finding be call ft']"
"As regards the purported substitution of grounds on the part of the General Court, it is sufficient to note that the court did not exceed its powers of review in substituting its own assessment for that of the Commission, since the tax differential in question and the fact that the business tax is paid annually, as provided for in the General Tax Code, form an integral part of the reasoning adopted by the Commission in the contested decision.",prem,"[' regard substitution', 'company do exceed power', 'rt do exceed power', ' substitute assessment', ' substitute that', 'tax be pay ', ' provide code', 'differential form part', ' adopt commission', ' adopt decision']"
Recital 42 of the contested decision states that ‘the difference between the business tax actually paid by FT and that which should have been due under the ordinary law from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2003 constitutes State aid inasmuch as it represents an advantage for FT granted through resources which would otherwise have been incorporated in the budget of the State’.,prem,"['recital state ', ' pay ft', 'difference stitute aid', 'it represent advantage', ' grant resource', 'which would have be incorporate budget']"
Recital 49 of the decision states that the professional tax was payable annually.,prem,['recital state ']
"Furthermore, the point is also made that business tax is payable annually at recital 25 of the decision initiating the formal investigation, to which recital 15 of the contested decision refers.",prem,"['point be make ', ' initiate investigation', 'recital refer ']"
"Consequently, the General Court’s interpretation to the effect that the aid at issue consisted in the tax differential deriving from the application of the provisions establishing a special regime is consistent with the enacting terms of the contested decision, which categorises the regime applicable to FT between the years 1994 and 2002 as aid which is incompatible with the common market.",prem,"[' siste differential', ' derive application', ' establish regime', 'which categorise regime', 'which categorise aid']"
"Indeed, it is by virtue of that special regime that FT was not required to pay business tax in the amounts for which it would normally have been liable under the general law tax regime.",prem,"['ft be require ', ' to pay tax']"
The second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.,prem,['part must be reject ']
"In the light of the arguments put forward by the parties, it is necessary to consider whether the General Court erred in law in finding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had been correct in refusing in the contested decision to offset the amounts paid by FT by way of fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 against the tax differentials arising from the special tax regime for the period from 1994 to 2002, in order to determine whether that company benefited from State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.",prem,"[' put party', 'court err law', ' find paragraph', ' refuse decision', ' to offset amount', ' to offset order', ' pay ft', ' pay way', ' pay differential', ' arise regime', ' arise period', 'pany benefit aid', 'pany benefit purpose']"
"While recognising that, when examining a measure likely to constitute State aid, the Commission is entitled to take account of the specific charges imposed on an advantage, the General Court nevertheless found, at paragraph 207 of the judgment under appeal, that a measure cannot be saved from categorisation as aid where the aid beneficiary is subject to a specific charge which is different from and unconnected with the aid in question.",prem,"[' examine measure', ' to stitute aid', 'commission be entitle ', ' to take account', ' to take charge', ' impose advantage', 'court find paragraph', 'measure can be not save categorisation']"
"That affirmation on the part of the General Court is based on a correct interpretation of Article 87(1) EC (see Case 173/73 Italy v Commission [1974] ECR 709, paragraph 34), notwithstanding the fact that it referred incorrectly in that regard to the judgment in Case C‑66/02 Italy v Commission.",prem,"['affirmation be base interpretation', ' see case', ' withstand fact', 'it refer regard', 'it refer judgment']"
"The General Court therefore did not err in law in finding, at paragraph 208 of the judgment under appeal, that the validity of the French Republic’s and FT’s argument that the over-taxation of FT between 1991 and 1993, attributable to the fixed levy to which it was subject, offset the tax differential from which that company benefited from 1994 to 2002 depends on the analysis of the objective characteristics of the fixed levy applicable between 1991 and 1993 and on whether it may be regarded as a charge which is connected with the advantage enjoyed by FT as a result of its being taxed under the special regime as of 1994.",prem,"[' find paragraph', 'taxation offset differential', 'pany benefit 1994', 'validity depend analysis', 'it may be regard charge', 'which be necte advantage', ' enjoy ft', ' enjoy result', 'its be tax regime']"
It should be noted that the levy applicable to FT between 1991 and 1993 was determined by different parameters from those applied with effect from 1994 under the special tax regime.,prem,"['levy be determine parameter', ' apply effect', ' apply 1994', ' apply regime']"
The two tax regimes were in fact based on different legal models and operating parameters.,prem,['regime be base model']
"As is apparent from recital 17 of the contested decision and paragraph 209 of the judgment under appeal, under the tax scheme applicable to FT from 1991 to 1993, it did not have to pay any tax or levy other than the fixed levy.",prem,"['it do have ', ' to pay tax']"
The amount of the fixed levy was established not in accordance with the parameters used to determine the amount of business tax but by reference to the earnings paid to the State by the entity from 1989 to 1990.,prem,"['amount be establish accordance', ' to determine amount', ' pay entity', ' pay 1989']"
The fixed levy was also temporary.,prem,[]
"On the other hand, under the special tax regime applicable from 1994 for an indefinite period, FT was required, in principle, to pay all the general law taxes.",prem,"['ft be require principle', ' to pay taxis']"
"However, the rules governing its liability to business tax derogated from the general law and constituted the special tax regime.",prem,"[' govern liability', 'rule derogate law', 'rule stitute regime']"
"In those circumstances, the General Court was entitled to find, at paragraph 213 of the judgment under appeal, that the fixed levy must be regarded not as a charge connected with the introduction of the special tax regime, but rather as a special tax mechanism for FT established for the years prior to 1994.",prem,"['court be entitle ', ' to find paragraph', 'levy must be regard company', ' necte introduction', ' establish year']"
"In any event, as the General Court stated at paragraph 215 of the judgment under appeal, the mere fact that the fixed levy and the special tax regime were both introduced by Law No 90‑568 does not prove that FT’s liability to pay the fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 was connected with the creation of the special tax regime for the years after 1994.",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'levy be introduce number', 'fact do prove ', ' to pay levy', ' to pay 1991', 'liability be necte creation']"
"The General Court did not, therefore, err in law in concluding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was entitled to refuse to apply a set-off between, on the one hand, the amounts paid by FT between 1991 and 1993 by way of fixed levy and, on the other, the tax differentials arising as a result of the special tax regime established for that company for the years 1994 to 2002.",prem,"['court do number law', 'court do number cluding', 'court do number paragraph', 'commission be entitle ', ' to apply off', ' to apply amount', ' pay ft', ' pay 1991', ' pay way', ' arise result', ' establish pany', ' establish year']"
"Lastly, even if it were the case that the tax regime applicable to FT consisted of two inextricably linked periods, the first entailing over-taxation and the second under-taxation, it is accepted that Law No 90-568 introduced with effect from 1994 a special tax regime intended to be of indefinite duration.",prem,"['regime siste period', 'it be accept ', 'number introduce regime', 'number introduce effect', 'number introduce 1994']"
That law did not contain any mechanism for offsetting amounts due by way of fixed levy for the period from 1991 to 1993 against amounts due as of 1994 under the special tax regime.,prem,"['law do tain mechanism', ' offset amount', ' offset amount']"
It therefore provided no mechanism for determining the point at which over-taxation under the first regime should have been offset under the second regime.,prem,"['it provide mechanism', ' determine point', 'over should have be offset regime', 'taxation should have be offset regime']"
"As the Advocate General observed at point 100 of his Opinion, that over-taxation should have exhausted its effects at a given time, which necessarily entailed the conferring of an advantage on FT under the special tax regime.",prem,"['general observe point', 'taxation should have exhaust effect', 'taxation should have exhaust time', 'which entail ferre', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre ft', 'company ferre regime']"
The first and third parts of the second ground of appeal cannot therefore be upheld.,prem,['part can be not uphold ']
"It should be recalled, first, that the obligation to notify is one of the fundamental features of the system of control put in place by the Treaty in the field of State aid.",prem,"['it should be recall ', ' to number ify', ' put place', ' put treaty', ' put field']"
"Under that system, Member States are under an obligation, first, to notify to the Commission each measure intended to grant new aid or alter aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC and, second, not to implement such a measure, in accordance with Article 88(3) EC, until that institution has taken a final decision on the measure.",prem,"[' to number measure', ' to number commission', ' to grant aid', ' alter aid', ' alter purpose', ' to implement measure', ' to implement accordance', 'institution have take decision']"
"Consequently, in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Commission, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in Article 88 EC and a diligent business operator should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed.",prem,"['aid have be grant ', 'undertaking may number principle', ' entertain expectation', 'it have be grant pliance', ' lay ec', 'procedure have be follow ']"
"In particular, where aid is implemented without prior notification to the Commission, with the result that it is unlawful under Article 88(3) EC, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Joined Cases C‑183/02 P and C‑187/02 P Demesa and Territorio Histórico de Álava v Commission [2004] ECR I‑10609, paragraphs 44 and 45 and case-law cited).",prem,"['aid be implement ification', 'aid be implement result', 'recipient can not have expectation', 'recipient can not have time', 'recipient see case']"
"Moreover, the Court has held that, where aid has not been notified to the Commission, any apparent failure to act on its part in relation to the measure is irrelevant (see Demesa and Territorio Histόrico de Álava v Commission, paragraph 52).",prem,"['court have hold ', 'aid have be ifie commission', ' to act part', ' to act relation', 'court see demesa']"
"With regard to the present dispute, it is accepted that the tax regime at issue, which was introduced by Law No 90‑568, was not notified to the Commission.",prem,"['it be accept ', 'which be introduce number', ' ifie commission']"
"In so far as FT argues that there was no obligation to notify, because it had not been established that there was an advantage, it should be noted that neither the purported complexity of the tax regime at issue nor the periodic nature of the aid measure can release the Member State from its obligation to notify or give rise to any legitimate expectation on the part of the company receiving the aid.",prem,"['ft argue ', 'there be obligation', 'it have be establish ', 'there be advantage', 'it should be e ', 'plexity can release state', 'plexity can release obligation', ' to number ify', 'plexity give rise', 'plexity give expectation', ' receive aid']"
"As regards the possible relevance of exceptional circumstances which may give rise, notwithstanding the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, to a legitimate expectation that aid is lawful, it is sufficient to note that the General Court did not err in law in assessing such circumstances in the course of its detailed examination, at paragraphs 263 to 269 of the judgment under appeal, of all the arguments relied on before it in that regard.",prem,"[' regard relevance', 'which may give rise', ' withstand sideration', ' set paragraph', ' assess circumstance', ' assess rse', ' rely it', ' rely regard']"
"Consequently, the General Court concluded correctly, at paragraph 270 of the judgment under appeal, that the French Republic and FT had failed to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances enabling them to rely on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations.",prem,"['company clude company', 'company clude paragraph', 'republic have fail ', ' to prove existence', ' enable they', ' to rely principle']"
"As stated at paragraphs 59 and 60 above, the recipient of aid cannot, in principle, rely on considerations based on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations where the aid in question has not been notified to the Commission.",prem,"[' state paragraph', 'recipient can not rely sideration', ' base principle', 'aid have be ifie commission']"
The argument based on the La Poste decision does not contain any analysis of the special business tax regime applicable to FT.,prem,"[' base decision', 'argument do number ']"
"Accordingly, the General Court could do no other than point out, at paragraph 266 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had expressed no opinion at all on that special tax regime and had not, therefore, taken a view on whether it constituted aid.",prem,"['company do number', ' point paragraph', 'commission have express opinion', 'commission have express regime', 'commission have take view', 'company stitute aid']"
"As regards the argument that FT could have interpreted the context in which the La Poste decision was adopted as a definition of the Commission’s opinion on the tax regime at issue, it must be noted that the General Court, without erring in law, rejected that argument at paragraphs 265 to 269 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,"[' regard argument', 'ld have interpret text', 'ld have interpret definition', 'decision be adopt ', ' err law', 'court reject argument', 'court reject paragraph']"
"Consequently, the General Court was entitled to find that there was nothing of relevance in the La Poste decision that could have given rise to any legitimate expectation on the part of FT that the tax regime at issue was lawful in the light of the rules on State aid.",prem,"['court be entitle ', 'there be number', 'ld have give rise', 'ld have give expectation']"
"As regards the principle of limitation, Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 provides that the powers of the Commission to recover aid are to be subject to a limitation period of 10 years.",prem,"[' regard principle', 'article provide ', ' to recover aid']"
It is apparent from Article 15(2) of the regulation that the limitation period does not begin to run until on the day on which the unlawful aid is awarded to the beneficiary.,prem,"['period do begin ', 'number do begin ', 'aid be award beneficiary']"
"Consequently, the decisive factor in determining the starting point of the limitation period referred to in Article 15 is when the aid was in fact granted.",prem,"[' determine point', ' refer article', 'aid be grant ']"
"It is apparent from Article 15(2) of Regulation No 659/1999 that, for the purpose of determining the date on which the limitation period starts to run, that provision refers to the grant of aid to a beneficiary, not the date on which an aid scheme was adopted.",prem,"[' determine date', 'period start ', 'provision refer grant', 'scheme be adopt ']"
The determination of the date on which aid was granted may vary depending on the nature of the aid in question.,prem,"['aid be grant ', 'determination may vary ', ' depend nature']"
"Thus, in the case of a multi-annual scheme, entailing payments or advantages granted on a periodic basis, the date on which an act forming the legal basis of the aid is adopted and the date on which the undertakings concerned will actually be granted the aid may be a considerable period of time apart.",prem,"[' entail payment', ' grant basis', ' form basis', 'act be adopt ', 'company cerne ', ' will be grant aid']"
"In such a case, for the purpose of calculating the limitation period, the aid must be regarded as not having been awarded to the beneficiary until the date on which it was in fact received by the beneficiary.",prem,"[' calculate period', 'aid must be regard ', 'number having be award date', 'it be receive beneficiary']"
"It should be noted that, at recital 49 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that the limitation period started to run each year on the date on which the business tax was due from FT.",prem,"['commission state ', 'period start ', ' to run date']"
"As is apparent from paragraph 320 of the judgment under appeal, the limitation period starts to run afresh each time an advantage is actually granted, which may be on an annual basis, so that the calculation of the limitation period may depend on how the advantage is identified.",prem,"['period start ', 'advantage be grant ', 'calculation may depend ', 'advantage be identify ']"
"In the present case, since the finding as to whether aid existed depended on the different rates applicable in each municipality within whose territory FT’s establishments were situated, the General Court carried out an analysis, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, of the fact that business tax is charged annually and the consequences flowing from this.",prem,"['aid exist ', 'finding depend rate', 'establishment be situate ', 'court carry analysis', 'court carry paragraph', 'tax be charge ', ' flow this']"
"The General Court was therefore correct in finding, at paragraph 324 of the judgment under appeal, that, in view of the annual nature of business tax, the aid at issue could not be regarded as having been awarded before the year 1994, because that was the year in which the binding legal acts were adopted which made it possible, for the first time, to establish the existence of a tax differential.",prem,"[' find paragraph', 'number be regard ', ' having be award year', 'act be adopt ', 'which make ', ' to establish existence']"
"Moreover, the approach adopted by the General Court is confirmed by the wording of Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, from which it is apparent that it is the Commission’s powers to recover aid which are subject to a limitation period.",prem,"[' adopt court', 'approach be firm wording', ' to recover aid']"
"Lastly, as regards the argument that the General Court failed to have regard to the obligation to state reasons in relation to the principle of limitation, it is settled case-law that that court is not thereby required to provide an account that follows exhaustively and point by point all the reasoning articulated by the parties to the case.",prem,"[' regard argument', 'court fail ', ' to have regard', ' to state reason', 'it be settle law', 'rt be require ', ' to provide account', 'that follow reasoning', ' articulate party']"
"The reasoning may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the competent court with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see Case C‑105/04 P Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Electrotechnisch Gebied v Commission [2006] ECR I‑8725, paragraph 72; and Case C‑3/06 P Groupe Danone v Commission [2007] ECR I‑1331, paragraph 46).",prem,"['it enable ', 'person to know ', 'measure be take ', 'it provide company', 'it provide material', 'it to exercise power', ' see p']"
"It should be noted in that connection that, at paragraphs 323 and 324 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court provided a clear assessment of the characteristics of the business tax scheme, which enabled it to conclude, at paragraph 325 of the judgment, that the limitation period provided for under Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 had not expired by 28 June 2001, the date on which a request for information was sent to the French Republic.",prem,"['court provide assessment', 'court provide paragraph', 'which enable it', ' provide article', 'period have expire june', 'request be send ']"
"In those circumstances, the Court finds that the General Court responded to the requisite legal standard to the arguments relating to the principle of limitation relied on by FT and did not disregard the requirement to state reasons established in the case-law cited at paragraph 88 above.",prem,"['court find ', 'court respond standard', 'court respond argument', ' relate principle', ' rely ft', 'court do disregard requirement', ' to state reason', ' establish law', ' cite paragraph']"
"The principle of legal certainty – which is one of the general principles of European Union law – requires that rules of law be clear and precise and predictable in their effect, so that interested parties can ascertain their position in situations and legal relationships governed by European Union law (see, to that effect, Case C‑63/93 Duff and Others [1996] ECR I-569, paragraph 20; Case C‑76/06 P Britannia Alloys andamp; Chemicals v Commission [2007] ECR I‑4405, paragraph 79; and Case C‑158/07 Förster [2008] ECR I‑8507, paragraph 67).",prem,"['principle require ', 'party can ascertain position', ' govern law', ' see case', ' see case', ' see effect']"
"As regards the argument relied on in support of the fifth ground of appeal, it should be observed that the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal, that, on the basis of the Commission’s estimates, the aid at issue amounted to between EUR 798 million and EUR 1 140 million.",prem,"[' regard argument', ' rely support', 'it should be observe ', 'court point paragraph', 'aid amount million']"
"Since those figures delimit the range within which the final amount was to be established, the General Court found, referring in particular to paragraphs 31 to 40 of Commission v France, that the contested decision contained the appropriate information to enable that amount to be determined without too much difficulty.",prem,"['figure delimit range', 'court find ', ' refer paragraph', 'company taine information', 'amount to be determine difficulty']"
"It should also be noted that the Court of Justice held, at paragraph 29 of Commission v France, that no provision of European Union law requires the Commission, when ordering the recovery of aid declared incompatible with the common market, to fix the exact amount of the aid to be recovered.",prem,"['court hold paragraph', 'provision require commission', ' order recovery', ' declare incompatible', ' to fix amount']"
"It is sufficient for the Commission’s decision to include information enabling the recipient to calculate the amount itself, without overmuch difficulty (see also Case C‑480/98 Spain v Commission [2000] ECR I-8717, paragraph 25, and Case C‑415/03 Commission v Greece [2005] ECR I-3875, paragraph 39).",prem,"['decision to include information', 'decision to include difficulty', ' enable recipient', ' to calculate amount', ' see case']"
"Thus, the General Court stated, at paragraphs 302 and 303 of the judgment under appeal, that that range was based on estimates provided by the French authorities during the administrative procedure and that, since that Member State had been unable to calculate exactly the amount of the advantage from which FT had benefited under the regime at issue, the Commission was entitled to rely on the data thus provided.",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'range be base estimate', ' provide authority', ' provide procedure', ' to calculate amount', 'ft have benefit regime', 'commission be entitle ', ' to rely datum']"
"In those circumstances, the General Court correctly concluded, at paragraph 305 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision did not constitute a breach of the principle of legal certainty.",prem,"['company clude paragraph', 'decision do number ']"
"It follows from the foregoing that neither the French Republic nor FT can rely on that principle in order to prevent recovery of unlawful aid (see Case C‑148/04 Unicredito Italiano [2005] ECR I‑11137, paragraph 104).",prem,"['it follow forego', 'number can rely principle', ' to prevent recovery', ' see case']"
The General Court was therefore entitled to find that the contested decision is not vitiated by unlawfulness because it simply refers to an indicative range as regards the amount of aid to be recovered.,prem,"['court be entitle ', 'decision be vitiate unlawfulness', 'it refer range', ' regard amount']"
"Moreover, it is apparent from paragraphs 301 to 305 of the judgment under appeal that the judgment is not vitiated by an inadequate statement of reasons as regards the assessment of the plea alleging breach of the principle of legal certainty raised by FT and the French Republic.",prem,"['judgment be vitiate statement', ' regard assessment', ' allege breach', ' raise ft']"
