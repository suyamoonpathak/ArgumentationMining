"It should be noted that the decision-making nature of the 2004 letter, even if that were established, has no bearing on the lawfulness of the decision at issue.",prem,['decision making nature have number']
"In that regard, the General Court held, in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, having regard to the information available to it, that the scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES, which was notified in 2014 and which gave rise to the decision at issue, was substantially different from the provisional scheme as set out in the 2003 draft law which was the subject of the 2004 letter.",prem,['which give rise']
"That assessment by the General Court of the facts and evidence before it cannot be challenged before the appeal court, except where the facts have been distorted (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 May 2019, CJ v ECDC, C‑170/18 P, not published, EU:C:2019:410, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited), which is not relied on by the appellants, which claim only that the General Court did not examine the evidence adduced, nor did it take account of their offer to submit additional evidence.",prem,"['<ORG> examine evidence', 'it take account']"
"The plea in the application at first instance alleging that the Commission had found, in the 2006 decision, that the Czech scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES did not constitute State aid and that, consequently, that institution could not have decided to the contrary by the decision at issue, was rejected by the General Court in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, inter alia, on the ground that it had been put before it for the first time only in the reply and that, as a result, it constituted a new inadmissible plea.",prem,['company stitute plea']
It is common ground that that plea was only put forward for the first time in the reply.,prem,[]
"Furthermore, contrary to what the appellants claim, it cannot be regarded as the extension of the first plea in the action before the General Court, which alleged that the 2004 letter, by which the Commission had adopted a position on the proposed scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES, was a decision.",prem,['<ORG> adopt position']
"Moreover, the appellants were not in a position, either before the Court of Justice or the General Court, to provide reasons why that plea could not have been put forward earlier.",prem,[]
"Consequently, the General Court correctly applied Article 84(1) of its Rules of Procedure by rejecting that plea on the ground that it was out of time.",prem,['<ORG> apply Article']
"According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, for infringement of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations to be established, it is necessary for an EU institution, by giving a citizen precise assurances, to have led that person to entertain justified expectations.",prem,['<ORG> lead person']
"Information which is precise, unconditional and consistent, in whatever form it is given, constitutes such assurances (judgment of 12 October 2016, Land Hessen v Pollmeier Massivholz, C‑242/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:765, paragraph 63).",prem,['company stitute assurance judgment']
"In that regard, in its 2004 letter, the Commission merely expressed a preliminary opinion on a draft of the promotion scheme which was adopted only the following year, the precise conditions of which were not then fully known.",prem,['<ORG> express opinion']
"Consequently, that letter did not give precise assurances that the initial scheme was not in the nature of State aid.",prem,['letter give assurance']
"Therefore, the General Court did not err in its legal characterisation by holding in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal that that letter could not give rise to any legitimate expectation.",prem,"['<ORG> do number', 'letter company ld number give rise']"
Nor can the General Court be criticised for not taking the view that such an expectation could result from the alleged ‘2006 decision’.,prem,['number take view']
"As the General Court pointed out in paragraph 60 of the judgment under appeal, that decision had not been placed on the file, nor even specifically identified by the appellants.",prem,[]
"Nor do the appellants demonstrate that the General Court incorrectly characterised the Commission’s conduct between 2004 and the adoption of the decision at issue in finding, in paragraph 78 of the judgment under appeal, that that conduct could not be regarded as having provided precise, unconditional and consistent assurances that there was no State aid.",prem,"['<ORG> characterise <ORG>', 'there be <ORG>']"
"Moreover, the appellants may criticise the General Court for failing to take into account certain other factors, which they claim to have submitted to it, only if that evidence proves that they could rely on a legitimate expectation that the initial scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES would be maintained.",prem,['appellant criticise <ORG>']
The appellants have not shown that that evidence was sufficient to justify the legitimate expectation alleged.,prem,[]
"In particular, the appellants do not effectively challenge the finding, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that exceptional circumstances should not be taken into account in the present case, in so far as that consideration was envisaged, in the judgment of 11 July 1996, SFEI and Others (C‑39/94, EU:C:1996:285), only in order to establish that, in certain cases, the repayment of State aid sought before a national court is inappropriate.",prem,['appellant challenge finding']
"By the first part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants, referring to the judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission (C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268, paragraphs 83 to 85), submit that it is not sufficient that the initial promotion scheme was financed by a compulsory levy to enable it to be regarded as being financed through State resources.",prem,[]
"However, it must be pointed out that that argument is based on a misreading of that judgment.",prem,[]
"It is apparent from that judgment that the fact of coming from a compulsory levy is, on the contrary, sufficient to identify State resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 March 2019, Germany v Commission, C‑405/16 P, EU:C:2019:268, paragraphs 65 to 72).",prem,[]
"On the other hand, it is irrelevant that the financing mechanism at issue does not, strictly speaking, fall within the category of fiscal levies under national law (see, to that effect, order of 22 October 2014, Elcogás, C‑275/13, not published, EU:C:2014:2314, paragraph 31).",prem,[]
The first part of the fourth ground of appeal must therefore be rejected as unfounded.,prem,[]
"By the second part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court, in any event, infringed EU law and committed a procedural irregularity in finding that there was a compulsory levy.",prem,"['<ORG> infringe <ORG>', 'there be levy']"
"However, even if that finding were incorrect, that error would vitiate the interpretation of national law.",prem,['error vitiate interpretation']
"The interpretation of national law by the General Court is not open to challenge before the appeal court, except where the facts have been distorted (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited), which has not been alleged in the present case by the appellants.",prem,[]
"Accordingly, this part of that ground of appeal must also be rejected as inadmissible.",prem,[]
"By the third part of their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants criticise the General Court for vitiating its judgment with a procedural irregularity by disregarding the evidence which they had adduced to the General Court or which they had proposed to be communicated to that court.",prem,['appellant criticise <ORG>']
"However, that part, which does not indicate the elements which are being referred to, is presented in terms that are too imprecise to enable the Court to assess its merits,",prem,['which indicate element']
with the result that it must also be rejected as inadmissible.,prem,[]
"The appellants submit, in essence, that, in paragraphs 130 to 136 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly held that the ‘review mechanism’ of the scheme for the promotion of electricity production from RES had not been imposed by the Commission on the Czech Republic and that that mechanism did not exceed the requirements laid down in the 2008 Guidelines applicable to the facts at issue.",prem,['mechanism exceed requirement']
"However, first, the factual assessment that the Czech Republic voluntarily undertook to implement the ‘review mechanism’ does not, as is apparent from the case-law cited in paragraph 24 above, fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice when hearing an appeal, except where the facts have been distorted, which is not alleged by the appellants.",prem,[]
"Secondly, since the review mechanism must be regarded as having been introduced by the Czech Republic, any failure to comply with the 2008 Guidelines has no bearing on the General Court’s assessment of the legality of the decision at issue adopted by the Commission.",prem,['failure have number']
"First, assuming that the criticism that the General Court made a twofold error in finding that the initial promotion scheme provided for the fixing of tariff levels and was financed by a tax does not relate to an assessment of the facts, which does not as such fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice when hearing an appeal, it must be held that the appellants have not established that the General Court’s assessment on that point is incorrect.",prem,['<ORG> make error']
"Secondly, although by a second part of the sixth ground of appeal the appellants criticise the General Court’s rejection of the seventh plea in their action at first instance on the ground that it lacks precision, their arguments are themselves too imprecise to enable the Court of Justice’s to assess the merits.",prem,"['appellant criticise <ORG>', 'it lack precision']"
It must be stated that the appellants set out the complaint which they criticise the General Court for having misunderstood in the same terms as paragraph 144 of the judgment under appeal.,prem,"['appellant set company plaint', 'they criticise <ORG>']"
"Thus, the first part of the seventh ground of appeal has no factual basis.",prem,['part have basis']
"As for the second part of this ground of appeal, it is ineffective, since it is not directed against the judgment under appeal.",prem,[]
"Furthermore, and in any event, the General Court held that the Commission had responded to the arguments raised during the administrative procedure, and that assessment is not open to challenge in an appeal, unless there has been a distortion of the facts, which is not alleged in the present case.",prem,[]
"By their eighth ground of appeal, the appellants, in essence, criticise the General Court for not finding, in paragraphs 157 to 163 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had exceeded the limits of its powers by asserting in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law, and, secondly, that any compensation granted, as the case may be, by an arbitration decision in itself constitutes State aid, infringes Article 108 TFEU and cannot therefore be enforced.",prem,"['appellant criticise <ORG>', '<ORG> exceed limit', 'Czech Republic infringe principle', 'company pensation stitute <ORG>', 'company stitute <ORG>']"
"In paragraphs 160 and 161 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court also erred in refusing to identify, in those assertions, the evidence of misuse of powers.",prem,[]
"It is common ground that the Commission stated in the decision at issue, first, that the Czech Republic had not infringed the principle of legitimate expectations under national law and, secondly, that any compensation which an arbitration tribunal might grant would, in itself, constitute State aid, would infringe Article 108 TFEU and would therefore not be enforceable.",prem,"['Czech Republic infringe principle', 'company pensation stitute state aid']"
"However, as the General Court found in paragraphs 158 and 159 of the judgment under appeal, those assertions do not form part of the necessary grounds for the decision at issue.",prem,['assertion form part']
"Therefore, the General Court was fully entitled to reject as ineffective the complaints alleging that those assertions were unlawful.",prem,[]
"Moreover, in paragraph 158 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court expressly accepted that the Commission lacked competence to make a decision on compliance with the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations under national law.",prem,['<ORG> lack company petence']
"As regards the existence of a misuse of powers, which the General Court did not take into account, it should be recalled that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it where, as in the present case, there is no allegation of distortion of that evidence.",prem,"['<ORG> have jurisdiction', 'there be number allegation']"
"Consequently, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,[]
It follows that the second ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,[]
It follows from the foregoing that the third ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,[]
It follows from the foregoing that the fourth ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,[]
It follows from the foregoing that the fifth ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,[]
"Consequently, the sixth ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,[]
It follows that the seventh ground of appeal must be rejected.,conc,[]
"Accordingly, the eighth ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,[]
