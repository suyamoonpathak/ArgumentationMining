"By its first ground of appeal, which is in four parts, the appellant challenges the judgment of the Court of First Instance in so far as it found that the contested decision was defective in that it excluded from the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty the measures relating to (i) the amendment in 1985 and 1986 of the allocation of betting levies, (ii) the cash-flow benefits granted to the PMU as a result of the authorisation to defer payment of certain of those levies, (iii) the PMU's access to winnings unclaimed by bettors and (iv) the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT in respect of the period after 1 January 1989.",prem,['appellant challenge judgment']
"In the first part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the Court of First Instance made several errors of law in holding that the three criteria relied on by the Commission in declining to categorise the measure concerning the reduction in the public levies for the benefit of the PMU as State aid were not an appropriate basis for ruling out the existence of aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",prem,['<ORG> make error']
"The appellant maintains, first of all, that in reaching that conclusion the Court of First Instance gave insufficient grounds, contrary to Article 190 of the EC Treaty (now Article 253 EC), for certain steps in its reasoning, that it failed to adopt a position with regard to certain crucial factors relied on both by the Commission, in the contested decision and in its pleadings before the Court of First Instance, and by the appellant itself, in its statement in intervention, and that it based part of its reasoning on false premisses.",prem,"['<ORG> give ground', 'it base part']"
It should be noted at the outset that the appellant's argument relates to the nature and scope of review of the Commission's assessment as to whether a measure adopted by national authorities is to be categorised as State aid.,prem,[]
"According to the appellant, the particular nature of the review of State aid means that, when the court carrying out the review is called on to assess the facts of the case in the light of legal criteria, it must limit itself to satisfying itself that there is no manifest error of assessment.",prem,"['it limit itself', 'there be error']"
"That form of review cannot be reserved for special circumstances, whose existence is in any event often difficult to ascertain.",prem,[]
"Consequently, the Court of First Instance erred in law in its definition of the nature of the review which it was to carry out in that it stated, in essence, that in the absence of special circumstances, arising in particular from the complex nature of the State intervention in question, review by it is not to be confined to determining whether there has been a manifest error of assessment as to whether aid is involved.",prem,[]
"The short answer to that is that State aid, as defined in the Treaty, is a legal concept which must be interpreted on the basis of objective factors.",prem,[]
"For that reason, the Community courts must in principle, having regard both to the specific features of the case before them and to the technical or complex nature of the Commission's assessments, carry out a comprehensive review as to whether a measure falls within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",prem,['<ORG> carry review']
The Court of First Instance therefore did not err in law so far as concerns the scope of judicial review of the Commission's assessments.,prem,"['<ORG> do number', 'company cern scope']"
"Second, the appellant alleges that, in its review of the present case, the Court of First Instance incorrectly assessed the arguments relied on by the Commission when finding that the measure reducing the public levies was not caught by Article 92(1).",prem,['<ORG> assess argument']
"The appellant maintains that the Court of First Instance wrongly failed to verify whether the criteria adopted by the Commission were justified, as stated in the contested decision, by the nature and scheme of the particular system at issue, whose existence the Court of First Instance indeed acknowledged.",prem,[]
"It accordingly erred in law, decisively affecting the outcome of the case.",prem,[]
"The appellant argues that, in the context of regimes applicable to the economy as a whole, consideration of the compatibility of particular measures with Article 92(1) of the Treaty by reason of the nature and scheme of the system of which they form part is essential where the issue is one of distinguishing mechanisms which may constitute State aid from others which are not caught by Article 92(1) precisely because they are justified by the nature and scheme of the system.",prem,"['they form part', 'which stitute state aid']"
The Court of First Instance could therefore not avoid consideration of whether there was such a justification here before categorising the measure at issue as aid.,prem,['there be justification']
"As to that, it is clear from paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance not only was aware of the specific nature of the tax regime applicable to horse-race betting in France but also took account of it.",prem,[]
"Furthermore, the appellant's reasoning is founded on an incorrect analysis of the contested decision.",prem,[]
"As the Advocate General states in points 25 and 26 of his Opinion, the Commission did not rely, a priori and in vague terms, on the particular nature of the French system of fiscal levies on horse-race betting in order to decide that the reduction in the public levies was not State aid.",prem,[]
"On the contrary, it applied three criteria of interpretation from which it derived the three propositions set out in paragraph 5 of this judgment, in order to reach the conclusion that that reduction amounted not to State aid but to a reform in the form of a ""tax"" adjustment that is justified by the nature and economy of the system in question.",prem,"['it apply criterion', 'it derive proposition']"
There is thus no substance to the proposition that the criterion relating to the nature and scheme of the system is independent of the other three criteria or constitutes the legal basis of the Commission's assessment.,prem,"['there be number substance', 'company stitute basis']"
"It follows that the Court of First Instance neither misconstrued nor refused to take account of the criterion of the nature and scheme of the system when it considered whether, having regard to the facts of the case, the Commission was entitled to find that the measure reducing the public levies did not fall within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",prem,[]
"Third, the French Government alleges that the Court of First Instance erred with regard to the legal characterisation of the facts by implicitly holding that the Commission could not infer from the fact that a specific operation was not financed and from the limited change in the public levies that the reduction in the rate of levy of 1.6% for the benefit of the PMU was consistent with the nature and scheme of the system and did not amount to aid within the meaning of Article 92(1).",prem,[]
"It should be noted that in paragraphs 57, 58 and 59 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance queried the validity of those two criteria adopted by the Commission, but it found in any event that the change in the rate of the public levies was designed to finance a specific operation and that the reduction in the rate of levy was not limited in nature.",prem,"['it query validity', '<ORG> query validity']"
"In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for the Court to establish whether the Court of First Instance was wrong to find that the Commission was not entitled to have recourse to those criteria in order to determine whether the fiscal measure at issue constituted State aid.",prem,['measure stitute <ORG>']
"In addition, the arguments relied on by the appellant to contest the findings of the Court of First Instance referred to in paragraph 32 of this judgment effectively dispute the Court's assessment of the facts, a matter not open to challenge on appeal.",prem,['argument dispute <ORG>']
Those arguments must therefore be rejected as inadmissible.,prem,[]
The final argument in the first part of the first ground of appeal consists in the assertion that a contradiction is apparent in the grounds of the judgment under appeal.,prem,[]
"The appellant refers in particular to paragraph 154 of the judgment, where the Court of First Instance stated that it is apparent from the contested decision that before the PMI was set up in January 1989 there was no trade between France and the other Member States, which means that before that date there was not even competition between the PMU and the other economic operators active on the Community market in bet-taking.",prem,"['there be number trade', 'there be company petition']"
"According to the appellant, on the very wording of Article 92(1) of the Treaty that statement should have led the Court of First Instance to find that no measure implemented for the benefit of the PMU before 1989, nor in particular adjustments to the public levies as from 1985 - at least so far as concerns their effects until the end of 1988 - could constitute State aid caught by that provision.",prem,"['statement lead <ORG>', 'company cern effect']"
That proposition cannot be accepted.,prem,[]
It is apparent from paragraphs 51 to 62 of the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance merely determined whether the three criteria referred to in the contested decision concerning the change in the public levies were sufficient to justify the finding that that change amounted to a reform in the form of a tax adjustment that was justified by the nature and scheme of the system in question.,prem,[]
"On the other hand, the Court of First Instance did not rule on the remaining criteria for application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, in particular on the question whether competition in the Community betting market was affected by that adjustment of the public levies.",prem,[]
There can thus be no contradiction between the conclusion set out in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal and the statements contained in paragraph 154 thereof.,prem,[]
The same considerations hold good for the other State measures examined by the Court of First Instance.,prem,['company sideration hold good']
"In the second part of the first ground of appeal, the French Republic criticises the judgment under appeal in so far as the Court of First Instance held that the Commission had misapplied Article 92(1) of the Treaty when it found that the cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer the payment of certain betting levies did not constitute State aid.",prem,"['French Republic criticise judgment', '<ORG> misapply Article', 'it find state aid']"
"It should be noted at the outset that the appellant repeats in part the objections raised in the first part of this ground of appeal, relating to the scope of judicial review and the alleged failure of the Court of First Instance to take account of the particular nature of the system of levies on horse-race betting in France and the way in which it is organised.",prem,['appellant repeat objection']
"For the reasons set out in paragraphs 23 to 30 of this judgment, those objections must be rejected.",prem,[]
"Next, the appellant criticises the Court of First Instance for finding, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision contains no statement to the effect that the change in the rules concerning payment to the Treasury of the betting levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a general amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector and not only for the PMU.",prem,"['appellant criticise <ORG>', 'company test decision company tains number statement']"
"Finally, the appellant alleges that, contrary to the statement made by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission did indeed set out in the contested decision evidence showing that the State intervention in question was made in the context of exceptionally heavy taxation of the horse-racing sector, which is significantly higher than in other sectors.",prem,['<ORG> set evidence']
"In that regard, suffice it to state, as the Advocate General has done in points 37 and 39 of his Opinion, that those arguments relate to the Court of First Instance's assessment of the facts, which cannot be challenged before the Court of Justice on appeal.",prem,[]
"In the third part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the Court of First Instance erred in law by holding, in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission's finding that the PMU's access to winnings unclaimed by bettors, while designed to finance social expenditure of the racecourse undertakings, did not constitute State aid because no transfer of State resources was involved was based on false premisses and for that reason had to be annulled.",prem,[]
"According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal should be set aside in that respect since, having regard to the nature and scheme of the system in question, the funds retained by the PMU after payment of winnings to bettors and of the public levies constitute normal resources.",prem,['fund stitute resource']
The mere fact that at a given moment the State restricts use of part of those resources to particular objectives cannot transform their nature and convert them into State resources.,prem,"['<ORG> restrict use', 'fact not transform nature']"
"In that regard, it is to be noted that in paragraphs 105 to 108 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance explains its assessment concerning the categorisation of the national measure in question as State aid.",prem,['<ORG> explain assessment company']
"As the Advocate General states in point 42 of his Opinion, that assessment leaves no room for criticism of its legal correctness.",prem,"['assessment leave number', 'assessment leave room']"
It is clear from those paragraphs of the judgment under appeal that the measure enables the racecourse undertakings to cover certain social expenditure of the PMU and that the amount of the sums corresponding to the unclaimed winnings is monitored by the competent French authorities.,prem,['measure enable racecourse undertaking']
"The Court of First Instance inferred therefrom in paragraph 109 that, inasmuch as national legislation extended the range of uses to which those sums may be put to activities of the racecourse undertakings other than those initially envisaged, the national legislature, by virtue of that extension, in effect waived revenue which in principle should have been paid over to the Treasury.",prem,"['legislation extend range', 'legislature waive revenue']"
"The Court of First Instance added in paragraph 110 that in so far as those resources had been used to finance social expenditure, in particular, as stated in the contested decision, it was settled case-law that they constituted a reduction in the social security commitments which an undertaking normally had to discharge, and thus constituted aid to it.",prem,"['it settle case law', 'company stitute reduction', 'company stitute aid']"
"The judgment in Case T-358/94 Air France v Commission [1996] ECR II-2109, relied on by the appellant, provides very clear confirmation, at paragraph 67, that Article 92(1) of the Treaty covers all the financial means by which the public sector may actually support undertakings, irrespective of whether or not those means are permanent assets of the public sector.",prem,"['judgment provide company firmation', 'article er mean', 'sector support undertaking']"
"Consequently, even though the sums involved in the measure allowing the PMU access to unclaimed winnings are not permanently held by the Treasury, the fact that they constantly remain under public control, and therefore available to the competent national authorities, is sufficient for them to be categorised as State aid and for the measure to fall within Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",prem,[]
"The fourth part of the first ground of appeal relates to paragraphs 118 to 122 of the judgment under appeal, in which the Court of First Instance held that the Commission erred in fact with regard to the implementation of the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT inasmuch as it found that the system of the permanent deposit with the French Treasury, offsetting the cash-flow benefits resulting from the altered time of deduction, had existed only since 1989 when it had begun to apply in 1969.",prem,[]
The appellant contends that the Court of First Instance set aside the Commission's assessment regarding the period after 1 January 1989 by relying on matters which essentially relate to the period before that date.,prem,['<ORG> set <ORG>']
"Furthermore, the Court of First Instance could not rely solely on those matters in order to conclude that the Commission's assessment in respect of the entire period after 1 January 1989 was erroneous.",prem,[]
"In this respect, the judgment of the Court of First Instance is, in its submission, vitiated by defective reasoning and, in any event, by an inadequate statement of grounds.",prem,[]
Those objections cannot be upheld since they are based on an incorrect analysis of the judgment under appeal.,prem,[]
"Contrary to the appellant's assertions, the Court of First Instance did not hold that the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT constituted State aid as regards the period after 1 January 1989 but merely found that, given the manifest errors of fact on which the whole of the Commission's line of argument was founded, it was impossible for it to rule as to whether or not State aid was involved.",prem,['exemption stitute state aid']
Such an assessment of the substance falls outside the scope of the appellate review which the Court of Justice may carry out.,prem,[]
"In its second ground of appeal, the French Republic contends that the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law inasmuch as the Court of First Instance held in paragraph 185 that the contested decision infringed Article 93(2) of the Treaty by limiting the temporal scope of the French authorities' obligation to require repayment of the aid derived from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy to the period after 11 January 1991, the date on which the procedure against the French Republic was opened, when reimbursement of the State aid should have been required from the date from which it was declared incompatible with the common market, that is to say from 1989.",prem,"['decision infringe article', 'it declare incompatible']"
It should be recalled that the Commission found in the contested decision that the PMU's exemption from the housing levy was incompatible with the Treaty from 1989;,prem,[]
"however, it considered that the PMU had to repay the corresponding sums only from the date on which the procedure was opened in January 1991, because until that time the PMU entertained legitimate expectations as to the legality of the exemption by reason of a judgment of the French Conseil d'État according to which operations of the racecourse undertakings were agricultural and therefore qualified for exemption from the housing levy.",prem,['<ORG> entertain expectation']
"The Court of First Instance stated in paragraph 184 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission could not itself take into account the recipient's legitimate expectations, as invoked by the Member State, in order to set aside the requirement that aid considered by it to be incompatible with the common market should be repaid.",prem,['<ORG> take expectation']
"According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law.",prem,[]
"More specifically, it complains that the Court of First Instance has denied the Commission the possibility of examining a Member State's argument that a recipient of aid entertained a legitimate expectation as to its legality.",prem,"['<ORG> deny <ORG>', '<ORG> deny possibility', 'recipient entertain expectation']"
"It adds that the position adopted by the Court of First Instance makes the procedure excessively cumbersome, since it does not allow a fundamental argument directly affecting the question of recovery of the aid to be considered at the stage of the Commission's review.",prem,[]
"It is unnecessary to examine whether the Court of First Instance was right in stating, at paragraph 183 of the judgment under appeal, that it is not for the State concerned, but for the recipient undertaking, in the context of proceedings before the public authorities or before the national courts, to plead exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had entertained legitimate expectations, justifying refusal to repay unlawful aid.",prem,['it entertain expectation']
"It need merely be stated that, as Ladbroke correctly submitted before the Court of First Instance, the reasoning in the contested decision was in any event inadequate so far as concerns waiver of the requirement to repay part of the aid declared incompatible with the common market.",prem,[]
"In the contested decision, the Commission merely referred to the existence of the judgment of the Conseil d'État, without in any way indicating why, in its opinion, it amounted to an exceptional circumstance liable to give rise to legitimate expectations on the part of the recipient of the aid notwithstanding the failure to comply with the rules laid down in Article 93 of the Treaty.",prem,[]
"The Court of First Instance was accordingly right to conclude that the contested decision had to be annulled in so far as it required repayment of the aid deriving from the PMU's exemption from the housing levy only from the opening of the procedure, that is to say from 11 January 1991.",prem,['it require repayment']
The first part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected.,conc,[]
"Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.",conc,[]
The third part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected.,conc,[]
"Accordingly, the final part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected as inadmissible.",conc,[]
The second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected .,conc,[]
