"It should be borne in mind, first, that in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Commission under Article 93 of the Treaty, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that article and, second, that a diligent businessman should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed (Case C-5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I-3437, paragraph 14; Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 51; and Case C-24/95 Alcan Deutschland [1997] ECR I-1591, paragraph 25).",prem,['procedure follow ECR']
"In particular, where aid is paid without prior notification to the Commission, so that it is unlawful under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Alcan Deutschland, cited above, paragraphs 30 and 31).",prem,['recipient not have expectation']
"In the present case, the Court of First Instance stated at paragraph 235 of the judgment under appeal that it was not disputed that the tax credit of 45% had been introduced without prior notification, in infringement of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",prem,[]
"At paragraph 236 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance correctly held, referring inter alia to Commission v Germany, cited above, that the argument based on the principle of the protection of legitimate interests could not be upheld.",prem,[]
"At the following paragraph of that judgment, the Court of First Instance correctly stated that the applicant’s argument was based on a misreading of Decision 93/337.",prem,[]
"In that decision, as the Court of First Instance emphasised, the Commission had characterised the aid in question as incompatible with the common market not only because it was contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty but also, at Part V of that decision, in which the Commission examines the possibility of applying one of the derogations provided for in Article 92 of the Treaty, because it did not comply with the various rules relating to aid.",prem,"['<ORG> characterise aid', '<ORG> examine possibility']"
"More specifically, in Decision 93/337 the Commission:

–
 had stated that the aid in question included a tax credit of 20% in respect of investments (Part I);",prem,['aid include tax credit']
"had considered that, for the purpose of applying the derogation provided for in Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines of 19 August 1992 on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ 1992 C 213, p. 2), which, after defining in point 2.2 the components of the category of small and medium-sized enterprises, stated, at point 4.1, fifth paragraph, that the Commission had decided to allow investment aid only up to the levels of 15% of the investment for small enterprises and 7.5% of the investment for other enterprises in the same category, were not satisfied (Part V);",prem,[]
"had ordered the Spanish authorities to ensure that the aid was granted, inter alia, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (Article 1(4)).",prem,[]
It is thus apparent that Demesa could not infer from Decision 93/337 that a tax credit of 45% granted to an undertaking of a size allowing it to make a minimum investment of ESP 2 500 million required by the Sixth Additional Provision of Norma Foral 22/1994 could not be categorised as aid for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.,prem,['it make investment']
">In the light of the terms of Decision 93/337, the appellant cannot therefore claim the possibility, which cannot be excluded (see Commission v Germany, cited above, paragraph 16), for the recipient of unlawful aid to rely on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful.",prem,['appellant not claim possibility']
"As regards the Commission’s alleged failure to act, the Commission rightly claims that any apparent failure to act is irrelevant when an aid scheme has not been notified to it.",prem,[]
"It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.",prem,"['party put plea', 'it bring case']"
"In an appeal the Court’s jurisdiction is thus confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59; Case C-7/95 P Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I‑3111, paragraph 62; and Case C-217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I‑3701, paragraph 37).",prem,[]
"In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that:

–
 the impugned tax measure is excluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid;",prem,[]
Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.,prem,[]
"In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the impugned tax measure in the course of argument as to whether that measure was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measure as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.",prem,['company cerne categorisation']
The Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraphs 167 and 168 of the judgment under appeal.,prem,['<ORG> examine argument']
"The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the impugned tax measure was excluded from the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.",prem,['company stitute plea']
The Territorio Histórico de Álava did not raise a plea alleging misuse of powers before the Court of First Instance in the proceedings at first instance which gave rise to the present appeal.,prem,"['<ORG> raise plea', 'which give rise']"
"For the reasons stated at paragraph 59 of this judgment, this ground of appeal must be declared inadmissible, as a new plea, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point, as the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.",prem,['ground declare inadmissible']
It follows that the ground of appeal which Demesa bases on the principle of protection of legitimate expectations must be rejected.,conc,[]
"This new plea must be declared inadmissible, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds in the judgment under appeal on the point of law raised, as the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.",conc,['plea declare inadmissible']
It follows from all of the foregoing that the appeals must be dismissed.,conc,[]
