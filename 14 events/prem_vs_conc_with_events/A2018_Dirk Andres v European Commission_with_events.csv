"Under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, any natural or legal person may, under the conditions laid down in the first and second paragraphs of that article, institute proceedings against an act addressed to that person or which is of direct and individual concern to them, and against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures.",prem,['person institute proceeding']
"In the present case, first, it is common ground that, as the General Court observed in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal, the contested decision is addressed solely to the Federal Republic of Germany.",prem,[]
"Moreover, as is apparent from paragraphs 58 to 79 of that judgment, whereas HBH was directly and individually concerned by that decision, and thus by virtue of the second situation referred to in that provision, the General Court held that HBH had locus standi.",prem,['<ORG> have standi']
"By the first part of its single ground of appeal, the Commission submits, in essence, that, in paragraphs 62, 63, 70 and 74 to 77 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law in assessing the condition of admissibility of HBH’s action in the light of the latter’s factual and legal situation, whereas the only relevant criterion was whether it was an actual or potential recipient of the aid scheme in question.",prem,[]
"According to the settled case-law of the Court, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if the decision affects them by reason of certain attributes peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and if, by virtue of those factors, it distinguishes them individually in the same way as the person addressed (judgments of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission, 25/62, EU:C:1963:17, p. 107, and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 57).",prem,"['decision affect they', 'it distinguish they']"
"The possibility of determining more or less precisely the number, or even the identity, of the persons to whom a measure applies by no means implies that it must be regarded as being of individual concern to them as long as that measure is applied by virtue of an objective legal or factual situation defined by it (judgments of 16 March 1978, Unicme and Others v Council, 123/77, EU:C:1978:73, paragraph 16, and of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).",prem,[]
"Thus, the Court stated that an undertaking cannot, as a general rule, contest a decision of the Commission which prohibits a sectoral aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme.",prem,['which prohibit aid scheme']
"Such a decision is, vis-à-vis such an undertaking, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (see judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited, and of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 49).",prem,[]
"In contrast, where the decision affects a group of persons who were identified or identifiable when that measure was adopted by reason of criteria specific to the members of the group, those persons might be individually concerned by that measure inasmuch as they form part of a limited class of traders (judgments of 13 March 2008, Commission v Infront WM, C‑125/06 P, EU:C:2008:159, paragraph 71 and the case-law cited, and of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 59).",prem,"['decision affect group', 'they form part']"
"Thus, the actual recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme of which the Commission has ordered the recovery are, accordingly, individually concerned within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraphs 34 and 35; see, also, judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 53).",prem,"['<ORG> order recovery', 'Italy see judgment', 'Italy see p']"
"Admittedly, as argued by the Commission, it follows from that case-law that the Court, on the one hand, acknowledges that the actual recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market are individually concerned by a Commission decision declaring that scheme incompatible with the internal market and ordering its recovery, and, on the other hand, precludes an applicant from being regarded as individually concerned merely because it is a potential beneficiary of the scheme.",prem,[]
"However, it cannot be inferred, as the Commission claims, that, where a Commission decision declaring an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market is at issue, the only relevant criterion for the purpose of determining whether an applicant is individually concerned, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, by such a decision, is whether the applicant is an actual or potential recipient of aid granted under the scheme.",prem,[]
"As also noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in points 57, 59, 67 and 68 of his Opinion, the case-law cited in paragraphs 43 and 45 of the present judgment, in the specific context of State aid, is merely a specific expression of the relevant legal test for assessing individual concern, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, stemming from the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17).",prem,[]
"According to that judgment, an applicant is individually concerned by a decision addressed to another person where that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them, or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons (see also, in the field of State aid, judgments of 19 October 2000, Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, C‑15/98 and C‑105/99, EU:C:2000:570, paragraph 32, and of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission, C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368, paragraph 52, and, in other fields, judgments of 17 January 1985, Piraiki-Patraiki and Others v Commission, 11/82, EU:C:1985:18, paragraphs 11, 19 and 31, and of 13 March 2018, European Union Copper Task Force v Commission, C‑384/16 P, EU:C:2018:176, paragraph 93).",prem,['decision affect they']
"Consequently, the fact that an applicant may fall within or outside the category of actual or potential recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme declared incompatible with the internal market by a Commission decision is not decisive as regards determining whether the applicant is individually concerned by that decision, where it is in any event established that the applicant is otherwise affected by it by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to it or a factual situation which differentiates it from all other persons.",prem,['which differentiate it']
"It follows from the foregoing that it is without erring in law that, after setting out, in paragraphs 60 to 62 of the judgment under appeal, the case-law set out in paragraphs 41 to 44 of the present judgment, the General Court, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, committed ‘to determine whether, given its legal and factual situation, [HBH] must be regarded as being individually concerned by the contested decision’.",prem,[]
"It also follows that it is without erring in law that, in paragraphs 62, 70 and 74 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, in support of its analysis, relied on the judgments referred to in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, since they all consist in applying the criterion of individual concern laid down in the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17), in circumstances where, as in the present case, the specific expression of that case-law, taking the form of a distinction between the actual and potential recipients of individual aid granted under an aid scheme declared incompatible with the internal market, did not appear relevant.",prem,['number appear relevant']
"Likewise, nor did the General Court err in law, in paragraphs 75 and 76 of the judgment under appeal, in rejecting the Commission’s argument that only an advantage effectively granted through State resources could establish that HBH was individually concerned on the basis of the judgment of 9 June 2011, Comitato Venezia vuole vivere and Others v Commission (C‑71/09 P, C‑73/09 P and C‑76/09 P, EU:C:2011:368).",prem,[]
"As has already been stated in paragraph 47 of present judgment, in order to establish that an applicant is individually concerned, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, by a Commission decision declaring an aid scheme incompatible with the internal market, the relevant criterion is whether the applicant is affected by that decision by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to it or a factual situation which differentiates it from all other persons , which the General Court also correctly recalled in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal.",prem,['which differentiate it']
"As regards the second and third parts of that single ground of appeal, it should be recalled that, in them, the Commission alleges that the General Court, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal, erred in law in holding that HBH was individually concerned on the ground that that company had had an ‘acquired right’ to receive aid under the measure at issue.",prem,[]
"In that respect, it should be noted that, in paragraph 74 of that judgment, the General Court stated in particular that ‘in the present case, … it was found that, because of the particularities of the German tax legislation, [HBH] had an acquired right to a tax saving, certified by the German tax authorities …, that circumstance setting it apart from other operators which are concerned only as potential beneficiaries of the measure at issue’, referring in that respect to paragraph 68 of the judgment.",prem,"['<ORG> have right', 'circumstance set it']"
"In paragraph 68 of that judgment, the General Court found that the circumstances which it had identified in paragraphs 66 and 67 of that judgment as characterising HBH’s legal and factual situation within the meaning of the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17), had been certified by the German tax authorities, in particular by means of binding information.",prem,[]
"Those circumstances consisted, on the one hand, in the fact that, prior to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure by the Commission, HBH had a right, under German legislation, to carry its losses forward where the conditions stipulated by the restructuring clause were satisfied and, on the other, in the fact that, during 2009, HBH made taxable profits from which it claims to have deducted the losses carried forward under the restructuring clause.",prem,['<ORG> make profit']
"It concluded, in paragraph 69 of the judgment under appeal, that, ‘pursuant to the German legislation, it was certain that, at the close of the 2009 tax year, [HBH] would have made a tax saving, which it was, moreover, able to quantify precisely’, since ‘the German authorities had no discretion with regard to the application of the measure at issue, the realisation of that tax saving was only a matter of time, under the detailed rules for the implementation of the tax system’.",prem,"['<ORG> make tax saving', 'authority have number discretion']"
"In point 69, it stated that, consequently, HBH ‘had an acquired right, certified by the German authorities before the adoption of the opening decision and, subsequently, of the contested decision, to the application of that tax saving, which, had it not been for those decisions, would have crystallised as a result of the issue of a tax assessment authorising the loss carry-forward and the consequent posting thereof to the applicant’s balance sheet’ and that it ‘was, therefore, easily identifiable by the German tax authorities and the Commission’.",prem,['<ORG> have right']
"It concluded, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, that HBH ‘may not be regarded solely as an undertaking concerned by the contested decision because it belongs to the sector in question and because of its status as a potential beneficiary, but must rather be seen as being part of a closed category of traders, who were identified or at least readily identifiable at the time of the adoption of the contested decision, within the meaning of the judgment [of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17)]’.",prem,[]
"It is thus apparent from a reading of the relevant passages of the judgment under appeal that the use by the General Court, in paragraph 74 of that judgment, of the words ‘acquired right’ was intended only to refer briefly to HBH’s specific factual and legal situation, making it possible to regard it as being individually concerned by the contested decision within the meaning of the judgment of 15 July 1963, Plaumann v Commission (25/62, EU:C:1963:17).",prem,[]
"By the first part of its second ground of appeal, HBH, supported by the Federal Republic of Germany, submits, in essence, that the General Court, in paragraphs 103 to 107 of the judgment under appeal, incorrectly determined the reference framework within which the selectivity of the measure at issue was to be examined.",prem,['<ORG> determine reference framework']
"Since the Commission objected to the admissibility of that first limb, on the ground that it concerned questions of fact, it should be noted that, admittedly, the assessment of facts and evidence does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the facts and evidence has been distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal.",prem,"['it number company stitute', 'assessment number company stitute']"
"However, where the General Court has determined or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review their legal characterisation and the legal conclusions which were drawn therefrom (judgments of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited, and of 20 December 2017, Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco and Others v Commission, C‑66/16 P to C‑69/16 P, EU:C:2017:999, paragraph 97).",prem,['<ORG> have jurisdiction']
"Thus, with respect to the assessment, in the context of an appeal, of the General Court’s findings on national law, which, in the field of State aid, constitute findings of fact, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction only to determine whether that law was distorted (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 79 and the case-law cited, and of 20 December 2017, Comunidad Autónoma del País Vasco and Others v Commission, C‑66/16 P to C‑69/16 P, EU:C:2017:999, paragraph 98).",prem,"['which stitute finding', 'company stitute finding', '<ORG> have jurisdiction']"
"By contrast, since the assessment, in the context of an appeal, of the legal classification which has been given to that national law by the General Court in the light of a provision of EU law constitutes a question of law, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 83, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraphs 61 to 63).",prem,"['which give to', 'company stitute question']"
"In the present case, it must be stated that, by that first part, HBH is not disputing the content or the scope of national law as found by the General Court, but rather the classification as a ‘reference framework’ which, like the Commission in the contested decision, the General Court gave to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses.",prem,"['which give to', '<ORG> give to']"
"However, the concept of ‘reference framework’ refers to the first step of the assessment of the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, which, according to the case-law of the Court, is a constituent factor in the concept of ‘State aid’ within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU (judgments of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 74 and the case-law cited, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 54).",prem,[]
"Since the purpose of HBH’s line of argument is to call into question the legal characterisation of the facts by the General Court, the first part of the second ground of appeal is admissible.",prem,[]
"On the merits, it should be recalled that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, classification of a national measure as ‘State aid’, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, requires all the following conditions to be fulfilled.",prem,[]
"First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources.",prem,[]
"Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States.",prem,[]
"Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient.",prem,['it fer advantage']
"Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgments of 10 June 2010, Fallimento Traghetti del Mediterraneo, C‑140/09, EU:C:2010:335, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited).",prem,[]
"So far as concerns the condition relating to the selectivity of the advantage, it is clear from settled case-law that, in order to assess that condition, it is necessary to determine whether, under a particular legal regime, the national measure in question is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ over others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation and which are accordingly subject to different treatment that can, in essence, be classified as discriminatory (see judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 54 and the case-law cited).",prem,[]
"Further, where the measure at issue is conceived as an aid scheme and not as individual aid, it is for the Commission to establish that that measure, although it confers an advantage of general application, confers the benefit of that advantage exclusively on certain undertakings or certain business sectors (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it fer advantage', 'company fer benefit']"
"As regards, in particular, national measures that confer a tax advantage, it must be recalled that a measure of that nature which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable position than other taxpayers is capable of procuring a selective advantage for the recipients and, consequently, constitutes State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU .",prem,"['company fer tax advantage', 'number involve transfer', 'which place recipient', 'company stitute <ORG>']"
"On the other hand, a tax advantage resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators does not constitute aid within the meaning of that provision (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 72 and 73 and the case-law cited; see, also, judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 56).",prem,"['case law see judgment', 'case law see p', 'case law see euc2016981']"
"In that context, in order to classify a national tax measure as ‘selective’, the Commission must begin by identifying the ordinary or ‘normal’ tax system applicable in the Member State concerned, and thereafter demonstrate that the tax measure at issue is a derogation from that ordinary system, in so far as it differentiates between operators who, in the light of the objective pursued by that ordinary tax system, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (see to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 57 and the case-law cited).",prem,[]
"The concept of ‘State aid’ does not, however, cover measures that differentiate between undertakings which, in the light of the objective pursued by the legal regime concerned, are in a comparable factual and legal situation, and are, therefore, a priori selective, where the Member State concerned, thirdly, is able to demonstrate that that differentiation is justified since it flows from the nature or general structure of the system of which the measures form part (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 52; see also judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 58 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['company cept number measure', 'measure form part']"
"The examination of the selectivity condition therefore implies, in principle, the determination, first, of the reference framework within which the measure concerned falls, that determination being of greater importance in the case of tax measures, since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation (see, to that effect, judgments of 6 September 2006, Portugal v Commission, C‑88/03, EU:C:2006:511, paragraph 56, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 55).",prem,['examination imply determination']
"Thus, the determination of the set of undertakings which are in a comparable factual and legal situation depends on the prior definition of the legal regime in the light of whose objective it is necessary, where applicable, to examine whether the factual and legal situation of the undertakings favoured by the measure in question is comparable with that of those which are not (judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt Lübeck, C‑524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 60).",prem,[]
"However, the classification of a tax system as ‘selective’ is not conditional upon that system being designed in such a way that undertakings which might enjoy a selective advantage are, in general, subject to the same tax burden as other undertakings but benefit from derogating provisions, so that the selective advantage may be identified as being the difference between the normal tax burden and that borne by those former undertakings (judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraph 91).",prem,['which enjoy advantage']
Such an interpretation of the selectivity criterion would require that in order for a tax system to be classifiable as ‘selective’ it must be designed in accordance with a certain regulatory technique;,prem,[]
"the consequence of this would be that national tax rules fall from the outset outside the scope of control of State aid on account of the sole fact that they were adopted under a different regulatory technique although, by adjusting and combining various tax rules, they produce the same effects in law and/or in fact.",prem,['they produce effect']
"It therefore conflicts with settled case-law that Article 107(1) TFEU does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects, and thus independently of the techniques used (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2011, Commission and Spain v Government of Gibraltar and United Kingdom, C‑106/09 P and C‑107/09 P, EU:C:2011:732, paragraphs 87, 92 and 93 and the case-law cited).",prem,[]
"If, on the basis of that case-law, the use of a regulatory technique cannot enable national tax rules to escape from the outset the scrutiny concerning State aid provided for under the FEU Treaty, resorting to the regulatory technique used is not sufficient to define the relevant reference framework for the purposes of assessing the condition relating to selectivity, except in order to ensure that the form of State intervention prevails decisively over its effects.",prem,"['use not enable tax rule', 'company cerne <ORG>']"
"Consequently, as also noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 108 of his Opinion, the regulatory technique used cannot be decisive for the purposes of determining the reference framework.",prem,[]
"However, it also follows from that case-law that while, for the purposes of establishing the selectivity of a tax measure, the regulatory technique used is not decisive, with the result that it is not always necessary for it to derogate from a common tax system, the fact that it is a derogation as a result of the use of that regulatory technique is relevant for those purposes where it follows that two categories of operators are distinguished and a priori treated differently, namely those covered by the derogation and those which are covered by the ordinary taxation regime, even though those two categories are in a comparable situation with regard to the objective pursued by that system (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 77).",prem,['company see judgment']
"Further, it must be recalled that the fact that only taxpayers satisfying the conditions for the application of a measure may benefit from the measure does not, in itself, make it selective (judgments of 29 March 2012, 3M Italia, C‑417/10, EU:C:2012:184, paragraph 42, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 59).",prem,[]
"It is in the light of those considerations that the Court must examine whether, as maintained by HBH and the Federal Republic of Germany, the General Court disregarded, in the present case, Article 107(1) TFEU, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, in holding that the Commission had not erred in holding that the relevant reference framework for assessing the selectivity of the measure at issue was constituted by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses.",prem,['<ORG> disregard TFEU']
"In that regard, it should be noted that, in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that ‘in the contested decision, the Commission established … the rule governing the forfeiture of losses as being the general rule in respect of which it was appropriate to examine whether there was a distinction between the undertakings that were in a comparable factual and legal situation, while [HBH] refers to the more general rule of loss carry-forward, which applies to all taxation’.",prem,"['<ORG> establish rule', 'there be distinction']"
"It also pointed out, in paragraph 104 of that judgment, that ‘it is open to all undertakings to make use of the loss carry-forward rule in the context of the levying of corporation tax’ and that ‘the rule governing the forfeiture of losses restricts the use of that option in the event of the acquisition of a shareholding equal to or greater than 25% of the share capital and withdraws it in the event of the acquisition of more than 50% of the share capital’, stating that ‘the latter rule therefore applies systematically to all cases of a change of ownership of 25% or more of a company’s share capital, without drawing any distinction on the basis of the nature or characteristics of the undertakings concerned’.",prem,['rule restrict use']
"In paragraph 105 of that judgment, the General Court additionally stated ‘furthermore, the restructuring clause is worded in the form of an exception to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses and applies only to those well-defined situations which are subject to that rule’.",prem,[]
"In paragraph 106 of that judgment, it concluded that ‘it is clear that the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, like the loss carry-forward rule, is part of the legislative framework in the context of which the measure at issue arises’, that ‘in other words, the general loss carry-forward rule, as limited by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, constitutes the relevant legal framework in the present case, and [that] it is precisely within that framework that it is appropriate to check whether the measure at issue differentiates between operators in a comparable factual and legal situation’.",prem,['company stitute framework']
"In paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that ‘the Commission did not err when, while noting the existence of a more general rule, namely the loss carry-forward rule, it determined that the legislative framework of reference established in order to assess the selectivity of the measure at issue was constituted by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses’.",prem,[]
"As submitted by HBH and the Federal Republic of Germany, that reasoning led the General Court to classify incorrectly the rule governing the forfeiture of losses as the reference framework within the meaning of the case-law on Article 107(1) TFEU, while excluding from that reference framework the general rule of loss carry-forward.",prem,['reasoning lead <ORG>']
"It is apparent from that reasoning that, although the General Court found that there was a general tax rule applicable to all undertakings subject to corporation tax, namely the loss carry-forward rule, it held, however, that the Commission did not err in taking the view that the relevant reference framework for the purposes of examining the selective nature of the measure at issue was constituted only by the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, despite the fact that it was not disputed that that rule was itself an exception to the loss carry-forward rule and even though an overall examination of the content of those provisions should have made it possible to find that the restructuring clause’s effect was to define a situation falling under the general loss carry-forward rule.",prem,['there be tax rule']
"As also noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 109 of his Opinion, it follows from the case-law of the Court, recalled in paragraphs 90 to 93 of the present judgment, that the selectivity of a tax measure cannot be precisely assessed on the basis of a reference framework consisting of some provisions that have been artificially taken from a broader legislative framework.",prem,[]
"Therefore, by thus excluding from the relevant reference framework in the present case the general rule of loss carry-forward, manifestly the General Court defined it too narrowly.",prem,['<ORG> define it']
"To the extent that, in reaching that conclusion, the Court relied on the fact that the measure at issue was worded in the form of an exception to the rule governing the forfeiture of losses, it should be recalled that, as has already been pointed out in paragraph 92 of the present judgment, the regulatory technique used cannot be decisive for the purposes of the determination of the reference framework.",prem,[]
"In addition, any argument in support of the judgment under appeal cannot, in this case, be based on the judgment of 18 July 2013, P (C‑6/12, EU:C:2013:525), since, in that judgment, the Court did not rule on what should constitute the reference framework in the case before it.",prem,['what stitute reference framework']
"It follows from all of the foregoing that the first part of HBH’s second ground of appeal is well founded, without it being necessary to examine the second part of the argument put forward to support it.",prem,[]
"It should also be noted that it is on the basis of its flawed legal assessment — that the Commission did not err in holding that the relevant reference framework in the present case for the purposes of assessing the selectivity of the measure at issue was made up only of the rule governing the forfeiture of losses — that the General Court analysed the submissions made to it by HBH, seeking to show, on the one hand, the lack of a priori selectivity of the measure at issue and, on the other hand, the justification of the measure by the nature and overall structure of the tax system.",prem,"['<ORG> do number', '<ORG> analyse submission']"
"As is apparent from the case-law referred to in paragraphs 83 and 86 to 89 of the present judgment, an error in the determination of the reference framework against which the selectivity of the measure should be assessed necessarily vitiates the whole of the analysis of the condition relating to selectivity.",prem,['error vitiate whole']
"Consequently, since the first part of the single ground of appeal of the cross-appeal is unfounded, it must be rejected.",conc,[]
"Since the second and third parts of the single ground of appeal are thus based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal, they must be rejected as unfounded, and, accordingly, the cross-appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.",conc,[]
"In those circumstances, the Court must uphold the appeal and set aside points 2 and 3 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal, without it being necessary to examine the second and third parts of the second ground of appeal, or the first ground of appeal.",conc,['<ORG> uphold appeal']
