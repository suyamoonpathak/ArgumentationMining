"Legal context 2 As is apparent from recital 2 in its preamble, Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p.",0,[]

…’ II — Factual background to the dispute 10 NDSHT is a company incorporated under the laws of Sweden which carries on the activities of a tour operator in Stockholm through its website.,0,['which carry activity']
"It offers a packaged service including hotel reservations and a tourist card called ‘Stockholm à la carte’, which gives holders access to a number of services and facilities in Stockholm, such as museums and local transport.",0,"['it offer service', 'which give holder', 'which give access']"
Stockholm Visitors Board AB (‘SVB’) is a company owned by the City of Stockholm through various subsidiaries.,0,[]
It is responsible for providing tourist information and promoting the Stockholm region.,0,[]
"In connection with that type of activity, it also pur sues commercial activities consisting, in particular, in the reservation of discounted hotel rooms in Stockholm and the sale of a package of tourist-related services, by means of a card called ‘the Stockholm Card’, offering free admission to places of inter est and facilities in Stockholm.",0,[]
"In September 2004, NDSHT sent the Commission information regarding the an nual grants made by the City of Stockholm to SVB for the years 2003 to 2005, alleg ing that those grants constituted State aid granted in infringement of Article 88(3) EC.",0,"['<ORG> send <ORG>', '<ORG> send information', 'grant company stitute state aid']"
NDSHT asserted in its complaint that that alleged State aid consisted in yearly I  -  11920 JUDGMENT OF 18.,0,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P appropriations from the City of Stockholm’s budget in favour of SVB, the reimburse ment of SVB’s pre-tax losses by its parent company on a regular basis, and preferen tial access to public facilities, such as metered parking managed by that city.",0,[]
"Accord ing to NDSHT, SVB could use that aid to finance its commercial activities that are, however, in competition with those of other national and international undertakings, thereby distorting competition.",0,['<ORG> use aid']
The Commission investigated NDSHT’s complaint in the light of supplementary in formation provided by the latter and by the Swedish authorities in response to re quests for information sent to them by the Commission.,0,['Commission investigate <ORG>']
"On 24 March 2006, the Director of ‘State Aid 1: Cohesion and Competitiveness’, the service in the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition responsible for the file (‘the Director of the Commission service responsible for the file’), sent the follow ing letter to NDSHT: ‘… I would like to inform you that, on the basis of the available information, the com petent services of the Directorate-General for Competition have reached the con clusion that there are not sufficient reasons for continuing the investigation of your complaint.",0,"['Director send letter', 'Director send to', 'company petent service reach company clusion', 'there be reason', 'company tinue investigation']"
"… I  -  11921 NDSHT v COMMISSION According to our analysis, the Stockholm Card and the hotel bookings are (with the exception of the inclusion of parking spaces in the Stockholm Card) carried out on market conditions.",0,[]
These activities are thus not financed from State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.,0,[]
"As regards the use of certain parking spaces for free, arguably there is no affectation on trade, or even if there is, such aid has been included in the Stockholm Card since well before Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and would thus constitute existing aid.",0,"['there be number affectation', 'Sweden join <ORG>']"
"Moreover, this service is since 1 Janu ary 2006 no longer included in the Stockholm Card.",0,[]
"With respect to other activities (the provision of tourism information, etc.",0,[]
"), it appears as if these are covered by the rules on Services of General Economic Interests (SGEI).",0,[]
Cross-subsidisation in favour of economic activities does not seem to occur.,0,[]
"In case the compensation for the SGEIs would be classified as State aid, such aid would nevertheless have been provided under the same conditions since well before 1995 and would thus constitute existing aid.",0,[]
"In summary, the extensive investigations we have undertaken on this complaint sug gest that we are in the presence of existing aid, and not illegal aid, which is in any case compatible with the common market.",0,[]
"Since there are no grounds to institute the ap propriate measures procedure provided for in Article 88(1) of the Treaty, we do not propose to take any further action on this matter.",0,['there be number ground']
…’ I  -  11922 JUDGMENT OF 18.,0,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P 15 By letter of 5 April 2006, NDSHT informed the Commission that it understood the letter of 24 March 2006 as meaning that its complaint had been rejected and a deci sion adopted pursuant to Articles 13 and 4(2) and (3) of Regulation No 659/1999 not to raise any objections with regard to the financial measures in question.",0,"['<ORG> inform <ORG>', 'it understand letter']"
"NDSHT also asked the Commission to send it a copy of that decision, in accordance with Article 20 of that regulation.",0,['<ORG> ask <ORG>']
"By letter of 28 April 2006, the Director of the Commission service responsible for the file replied to NDSHT stating that the information received did not indicate that the measures complained of constituted unlawful State aid and consequently no decision by the Commission under Article 20 of Regulation No 659/1999 could be addressed to it.",0,[]
"The proceedings before the General Court and the judgment under appeal 17 By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 6 June 2006, NDSHT sought the annulment of the act in question and the initiation of the formal investiga tion procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,['<ORG> seek annulment']
"By separate document, the Commission raised an objection of inadmissibility pursu ant to Article 114(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, to which ND SHT responded on 9 November 2006.",0,['<ORG> raise objection']
NDSHT claimed in its observations relating to the objection of inadmissibility that the act in question expressed both a final refusal on the part of the Commission to I  -  11923 NDSHT v COMMISSION initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC and a de cision to close the case.,0,"['act express refusal', '<NAME> initiate investigation procedure']"
The act in question should therefore be regarded as a decision affecting NDSHT’s legal situation.,0,[]
It thus constituted an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.,0,['it stitute act']
"By the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed NDSHT’s action as inad missible and ordered it to pay the costs.",0,['<ORG> dismiss <ORG>']
"The General Court held that, in order to determine whether the act in question con stituted an act open to challenge, it was necessary to establish, in the light of its sub stance, whether it constituted a decision under Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 or merely an informal communication pursuant to the second sentence of Article 20(2) of that regulation.",0,['it stitute decision']
"It stated, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was not obliged to adopt a decision within the meaning of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 in response to every complaint.",0,[]
Such an obligation arose only where Article 13 of the regulation was applicable.,0,[]
That was not the case where the complaint concerned existing aid.,0,['company cerne aid']
"In paragraph 64 of the judgment, the General Court considered that an obligation to adopt a decision within the meaning of Article 4 of that regulation fol lowing a complaint concerning existing aid would run counter to the general scheme of the State aid review procedure.",0,['obligation run company nter']
It is apparent from the substance of the letters of 24 March and 28 April 2006 (to gether ‘the contested letters’) that the Commission had decided not to pursue the complaint on the ground that the aid in question constituted existing aid covered by the procedure in Article 88(1) EC.,0,"['<ORG> decide number', 'company stitute aid company']"
"The General Court considered, in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, in that case, in the light of settled case-law, the Commission could not be compelled, by means of a complaint, to issue a recommen dation proposing appropriate measures to the Member States pursuant to Article 18 I  -  11924 JUDGMENT OF 18.",0,[]
0 — CASE C-322/09 P of Regulation No 659/1999.,0,[]
"Furthermore, none of the provisions thereof applicable to existing aid contemplated the possibility of the Commission’s adopting a measure amounting to a decision at the end of the preliminary examination of that aid.",0,"['number template possibility', '<ORG> adopt measure']"
"Finally, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that, since the Commission considered, at the end of its initial examination of the financial measures in question, that they should be regarded as existing aid, the contested let ters could not constitute a refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,['<ORG> stitute refusal']
"The General Court consequently concluded that the contested letters had to be re garded not as a decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999, but as an informal communication for the purposes of Article 20 thereof.",0,[]
"Therefore, they did not constitute an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.",0,['they stitute act']
"Forms of order sought before the Court 26 By its appeal, while disputing the classification of the measures in question by the Commission, NDSHT asks the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal in its entirety then, principally, to grant its application at first instance and order the Com mission to pay the costs or, in the alternative, to declare its action admissible, refer the case back to the General Court and reserve the decision on costs relating to the two proceedings.",0,['<ORG> ask <ORG>']
I  -  11925 NDSHT v COMMISSION 27 The Commission contends that the appeal should be dismissed and NDSHT ordered to pay the costs.,0,[]
The appeal 28 NDSHT raises four grounds in support of its appeal.,0,['appeal raise ground']
The first ground of appeal alleges manifest distortion of the contents of the contested letters.,0,['ground allege distortion']
"By its second ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the General Court erred in law in considering the act in question to be a preparatory act not constitut ing a definitive decision open to challenge in an action for annulment.",0,[]
"According to its third ground of appeal, NDSHT complains that the General Court erred in law in considering that the position adopted by the Commission should be treated as a rejection of a request for appropriate measures to be taken within the meaning of Article 88(1) EC.",0,[]
"Finally, by its fourth ground of appeal, NDSHT claims that the General Court also erred in law in holding that the classification, by the Commission, of the financial measures in question as existing aid prevented the rejection of the complaint from being challenged.",0,['classification prevent rejection']
"Such a solution was based on a misinterpretation of Articles 4, 10, 13 and 20 of Regulation No 659/1999.",0,[]
"Since the second to fourth grounds of appeal are closely linked, it is appropriate to examine them together.",0,[]
I  -  11926 JUDGMENT OF 18.,0,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P The second to fourth grounds of appeal Arguments of the parties 31 Referring, in particular, to Case C-521/06 P Athinaïki Techniki v Commission [2008] ECR I-5829, NDSHT alleges that the General Court misconstrued Articles 4, 10, 13 and 20(2) of Regulation No 659/1999 by holding that the rejection of its complaint by the Commission did not have the characteristics of a decision which produced binding legal effects such as to affect its interests and, therefore, of an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.",0,"['<ORG> misconstrue article', 'rejection have characteristic', 'which produce effect']"
"The appellant considers, in its second ground of appeal, that the General Court erred in law in stating that the act in question constituted not a definitive decision, but a preparatory act.",0,"['company stitute number', 'company stitute decision']"
"It submits that the Commission had, on the contrary, completed its examination and adopted a decision, without however having formalised it, the ob ject of which was to reject the complaint on the ground that the financial aid granted was compatible with the common market.",0,['<ORG> plete examination']
"In that regard, the appellant considers, in its third ground of appeal, that, in para graph 57 et seq.",0,[]
"of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law by clas sifying the position taken by the Commission as a rejection of a request for appropri ate measures to be taken within the meaning of Article 88(1) EC and not as a refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,[]
"Likewise, the I  -  11927 NDSHT v COMMISSION General Court wrongly asserted that the Commission could not be obliged by a com plainant to take a decision at the end of the preliminary examination stage.",0,[]
"Furthermore, the appellant claims, in its fourth ground of appeal, that Articles 4, 10 and 13 of Regulation No 659/1999 oblige the Commission, where it examines a com plaint concerning the existence of allegedly unlawful aid, to conclude the preliminary examination stage by adopting a decision, as is stated in Athinaïki Techniki v Com mission, paragraph 40.",0,"['article oblige <ORG>', 'it examine company']"
That obligation to take a decision also applies where the preliminary examination stage leads the Commission to believe that there is existing aid.,0,"['examination stage lead <ORG>', 'there be aid']"
The possibility of contesting a Commission letter refusing to initiate the formal investigation procedure on the ground that the contested aid was existing aid was confirmed by the Court in Case C-313/90 CIRFS and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I-1125.,0,"['company test <ORG>', 'company test aid']"
"Therefore, ac cording to the appellant, the General Court’s interpretation, in paragraph 64 et seq.",0,[]
"of the judgment under appeal, that it would run counter to the general scheme of the State aid review procedure to hold that the Commission necessarily adopts a deci sion under Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 where it informs a complainant that its complaint concerns existing aid is evidence of a profoundly mistaken view of that procedural system.",0,"['it run company nter', '<ORG> adopt sion', 'it inform company plainant']"
"That interpretation would mean that, by classifying the contested financial measures as existing aid, the Commission could avoid any review by the European Union judicature, which would be clearly unacceptable.",0,['<ORG> avoid review']
"The Commission acknowledges, first of all, that the contested letters do not deal with all of the financial measures in question and that it did not, by those letters, take a decision concerning existing aid.",0,['it take decision company']
"On the contrary, those letters contain a number of hypothetical, and accordingly not definitive, conclusions not leading moreover to an identical classification of those different measures.",0,['letter tain number']
"In those letters, the Commission, I  -  11928 JUDGMENT OF 18.",0,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P at the most, summarised the position of the service responsible for dealing with the complaint, according to which it did not at that time intend to pursue it.",0,['p summarise position']
"Next, the argument put forward by NDSHT that the Commission adopted a decision although without formalising it is inadmissible, since it was not put forward during the proceedings at first instance.",0,['<ORG> adopt decision']
"In any event, the Commission contends that it did not adopt a decision and restricted itself to a provisional assessment, the file on the complaint having been closed only in December 2006.",0,['it adopt decision']
"Furthermore, as regards existing aid, it could not adopt a decision immediately but had, if it considered the measures to be incompatible with the com mon market, first to inform the Member State concerned before possibly proposing appropriate measures.",0,"['company ld number adopt decision', 'it sidere measure']"
"Since Regulation No 659/1999 does not provide for any spe cific procedure to be followed in such a case, the only possible means of challenging the act in question would have been an action for failure to act.",0,[]
"Finally, the Commission contests the relevance of the references to CIRFS and Oth ers v Commission and Athinaïki Techniki v Commission since, when it has found that there is existing aid, the Commission is no longer in a position to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,"['<ORG> test relevance', 'there be aid']"
"I  -  11929 NDSHT v COMMISSION Findings of the Court — Admissibility of the argument invoked by NDSHT relating to the fact that the Commission’s decision was not formalised 40 According to the Commission, the argument put forward by the appellant that it concluded its examination of the financial measures in question with a decision that was not formalised was not raised before the General Court and is accordingly inadmissible.",1,['company clude examination']
"In that regard, it must be observed that it follows from Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in conjunction with Article 113(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that, on appeal, an appellant may put forward any relevant argument, provided only that the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court is not changed in the appeal (Case C-229/05 P PKK and KNK v Council [2007] ECR I-439, paragraph 66, and Case C-8/06 P Herrero Romeu v Commission [2007] ECR I-10333, paragraph 32).",1,['appellant put argument']
"However, it is clear that, contrary to the Commission’s contention, that argument was indeed included in the application lodged by NDSHT before the General Court, in which it is claimed, in paragraph 29, that ‘it is settled case-law that the form in which acts or decisions are cast has no bearing on the right to challenge them’.",1,['form have number bearing']
"Therefore, even assuming that that argument was not expressed in the appeal in the same terms as in that application, it does not change the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court.",1,['it change subject matter']
I  -  11930 JUDGMENT OF 18.,1,[]
It follows that that argument is admissible.,1,[]
"The appellant seeks in essence to show, in its second to fourth grounds of appeal, that the General Court erred in law in holding that the contested letters did not have the characteristics of an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.",1,['letter have characteristic']
"In that regard, the Court has repeatedly held that an action for annulment for the purposes of Article 230 EC must be available against all acts adopted by the institu tions, whatever their nature or form, which are intended to have legal effects cap­ able of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position (see, inter alia, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 29 and case-law cited, and Case C-362/08 P Internationaler Hilfsfonds v Commission [2010] ECR I-669, paragraph 51).",1,[]
"It follows also from settled case-law concerning the admissibility of actions for an nulment that it is necessary to look to the actual substance of the acts challenged in order to classify them (see, in particular, Case 60/81 IBM v Commission [1981] ECR 2639, paragraph 9, and Case C-147/96 Netherlands v Commission [2000] ECR I-4723, paragraph 27).",1,['case law company cerne admissibility']
"By contrast, the form in which an act or decision is adopted is in principle irrelevant to the right to challenge such acts or decisions by way of an action for annulment.",1,[]
"It is therefore, in principle, irrelevant for the classification of the act in question whether I  -  11931 NDSHT v COMMISSION or not it satisfies certain formal requirements, namely in particular, that it is duly identified by its author and that it mentions the provisions providing the legal basis for it.",1,"['it satisfy requirement', 'it mention provision']"
"It is therefore irrelevant that the act may not be described as a ‘decision’ or that it does not refer to Article 4(2), (3) or (4) of Regulation No 659/1999.",1,[]
"It is also of no importance that the Member State concerned was not notified of the act at issue by the Commission, infringing Article 25 of that regulation, as such an error is not capable of altering the substance of that act (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraphs 43 and 44 and case-law cited).",1,[]
"Furthermore, it is in principle those measures which definitively determine the pos­ ition of the Commission upon the conclusion of an administrative procedure, and which are intended to have legal effects capable of affecting the interests of the com plainant, that constitute acts open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC, and not intermediate measures whose purpose is to prepare for the final decision, which do not have those effects (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 42 and case-law cited).",1,"['which determine ition', 'that act open', 'which have effect']"
"With regard to the possible definitive and actionable nature of measures taken by the Commission in the procedure for reviewing State aid, it should be noted, first, that the Commission must, under Article 10(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, carry out an examination where it has in its possession information from whatever source regarding allegedly unlawful aid.",1,"['<ORG> carry examination', 'it have information']"
"The examination of a complaint, on the basis of that provision, gives rise to the initiation of the preliminary examination stage under Article 88(3) EC and obliges the Commission to examine, immediately, the possible existence of aid and its compatibility with the common market (see, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 37).",1,['examination give rise']
I  -  11932 JUDGMENT OF 18.,1,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P 50 Article 13(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, which is applicable in the context of an examination of a complaint alleging unlawful aid, obliges the Commission to close that preliminary examination stage by adopting a decision pursuant to Article 4(2), (3) or (4) of that regulation, that is to say, a decision finding that aid does not exist, raising no objections or initiating the formal investigation procedure, since that insti tution is not authorised to persist in its failure to act during the preliminary examina tion stage.",1,[]
"Once that stage of the procedure has been completed the Commission is bound, consequently, either to initiate the next stage of the procedure, provided for by Article 88(2) EC, or to adopt a definitive decision rejecting the complaint (see, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 40 and case-law cited).",1,[]
"Where the Commission finds, following examination of a complaint, that the investi gation has revealed no grounds for concluding that there is State aid within the mean ing of Article 87 EC, it refuses by implication to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, Case C-367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 47).",1,"['investi gation reveal number ground', 'there be state aid']"
"As regards the Commission’s finding that the measures complained of constituted existing aid, it should be noted that existing aid is of course subject to the constant review provided for in Article 88(1) EC and must be regarded as lawful so long as the Commission has not found that it is incompatible with the common market (see Case C-44/93 Namur-Les assurances du crédit [1994] ECR I-3829, paragraph 34, and Case C-400/99 Italy v Commission [2001] ECR I-7303, paragraph 48).",1,[]
"However, where it receives a complaint relating to allegedly unlawful aid, the Commission, in classify ing the measure as existing aid, subjects it to the procedure provided for by Art­ icle 88(1) EC and thus refuses by implication to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraphs 25 I  -  11933 NDSHT v COMMISSION and 26, and Case C-321/99 P ARAP and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I-4287, paragraph 61).",1,"['it receive company plaint', '<ORG> subject it']"
"Such a decision refusing to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC is definitive and cannot be characterised as a mere provisional measure (CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraph 26, and, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commis sion, paragraphs 54 and 58).",1,[]

"That principle applies equally, whether the ground on which the decision is taken is that the Commission regards the aid as com patible with the common market or that, in its view, the very existence of aid must be discounted (Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 47) or where it considers that there is existing aid (see, to that effect, CIRFS and Others v Commis sion, paragraph 27, and ARAP and Others v Commission, paragraph 62).",1,"['<ORG> regard aid', 'there be aid']"

"Moreover, as the Court has pointed out in paragraphs 52 and 60 of this judgment that a decision such as the act in question constituted an act open to challenge even though the Commission found that the measures complained of constituted existing aid, it is no longer necessary to examine the first ground of appeal put forward by the appellant alleging distortion of the contents of the contested letters.",1,[]
