"Legal framework and factual background Legal framework 2 The legal framework of the dispute was set out in the contested judgment as follows: '2 The general provisions on State aid set out in Articles 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC) and 93 and 94 of the EC Treaty (now Articles 88 EC and 89 EC) apply within the field of transport, subject to the special provisions of Article 77 of the EC Treaty (now Article 73 EC), which state that aids meeting the needs of coordination of transport or representing reimbursement for the discharge of certain obligations inherent in the concept of a public service are compatible with the Treaty.",0,[]
"Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 of 4 June 1970 on the granting of aids for transport by rail, road and inland waterway (OJ, English Special Edition 1970 (II), p.",0,[]
"), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 543/97 of 17 March 1997 (OJ 1997 L 84, p.",0,[]
"), which is based on I - 4124 ITALY v COMMISSION Article 75 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 71 EC) and Articles 77 and 94 of the Treaty, confirms that Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty are to apply in the field concerned.",0,[]
The regulation also lays down certain special rules on the aid in question in so far as they relate specifically to activities in that sector.,0,['regulation lay rule']
It thus sets out the cases in and conditions on which Member States are entitled to adopt coordination measures or impose obligations inherent in the concept of a public service which involve the granting of State aid pursuant to Article 77 of the Treaty.,0,"['it set case', 'which involve granting']"
"Regarding the coordination of transport, Article 3(1 )(d) of Regulation No 1107/70 authorises, until the entry into force of Community rules on access to the transport market, aid granted as an exceptional and temporary measure in order to eliminate, as part of a reorganisation plan, excess capacity causing serious structural problems, and thus to contribute towards meeting the needs of the transport market more effectively.",0,['Article authorise aid']
"In the course of introducing a common transport policy, the international road haulage market was partially liberalised within the Community by Council Regulation No 1018/68 of 19 July 1968 on the establishment of a Community quota for the carriage of goods by road between Member States (Journal Officiel 1968 L 175, p.",0,[]
"), which introduced a quota system in In 1991 and 1992, for example, the Community quota consisted of 47 094 and 65 936 authorisations distributed among the various Member States in accordance with a specific formula.",0,['which introduce quota system']

Community authorisations permitted their holders to carry goods between Member States for a period of one year.,0,['community authorisation permit holder']
"This system was kept in force up to 1 January 1993, the date on which this activity was fully liberalised by Council Regulation (EEC) No 881/92 of 26 March 1992 on access to the market in the carriage of goods by road within the Community to or from the territory of a Member State or passing across the territory of one or more Member States (OJ 1992 L 95, p.",0,[]

"Factual background 3 The facts set out in this paragraph are taken from the findings of fact made by the Court of First Instance in the contested judgment as follows: '7 Articles 4, 7 and 8 of Friuli-Venezia Giulia Regional Law No 28 of 18 May 1981, on action to promote and develop transport of concern to the FriuliVenezia Giulia Region and the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward (""Law No 28/1981""), provided for certain aid for road haulage contractors established within that region.",0,[]
"I - 4126 ITALY v COMMISSION 8 The system introduced by Law No 28/1981 was replaced by Regional Law No 4 of 7 January 1985 on action to promote and develop transport of concern to the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region and the carriage of goods by road for hire or reward (... hereinafter ""Law No 4/1985"").",0,[]
Articles 4 to 6 of Law No 4/1985 introduced a system of regional aid that was essentially identical to the system set up by Law No 28/1981.,0,['article introduce system']
"These laws provided for three measures in favour of road haulage contractors established in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region: (a) annual financing, over a maximum period of ten years, of up to 60% (for individual contractors) and 70% (for cooperatives and groups) of the reference rate laid down by Ministerial Decree, of interest on loans contracted for the purpose of (Articles 4 of Laws No 28/1981 and 4/1985): — developing the contractor's infrastructure (construction, purchase, expansion, completion and modernisation of premises required for its operations, including those to be used for the warehousing, storage and handling of goods); — purchasing, developing and renewing fixed and movable equipment, together with internal and road transport vehicles; (b) financing the cost of leasing, for a period of three or five years, new vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers and their swap-bodies, suitable for the operation of road haulage, together with the installations, machinery and I-4127 JUDGMENT OF 29.",0,[]
"4 - CASE C-298/00 P equipment for the use, maintenance and repair of vehicles and for the handling of goods, up to the level of 25% (for individual contractors) and 30% (for cooperatives and groups) of the purchase price of the assets.",0,[]
"This aid, laid down in Article 7 of Law No 28/1981 and Article 5 of Law No 4/1985, was reduced to 20% and then to 15% of the purchase price by subsequent regional laws; (c) annual financing, for groups and other forms of association, of up to 50% of investment to be used for the construction or purchase of installations and equipment required in pursuing the aims of the group or association, or contributing to the operation and development of service centres for housing, maintenance and repair of vehicles or related facilities and equipment (Article 8 of Law No 28/1981 and Article 6 of Law No 4/1985).",0,[]
"... the amount of credits earmarked for the aid referred to in Article 4 of Law No 4/1985, for the period from 1985 to 1995, amounted to ITL 13 000 million (EUR 6.7 million), and 155 applications had been [accepted].",0,[]
"On average, the level of aid disbursed ranged from 13% to 26% of the cost of the loans and interest.",0,[]
"The budget for the period 1981 to 1985 was ITL 930 million (EUR 0.4 million), and 14 applications had been accepted during this period (section II of the contested decision).",0,[]
"... the budget allocated for the aid covered by Article 5 of Law No 4/1985 amounted to ITL 23 300 million (EUR 11.8 million) for the period from 1985 to 1995, and 1 691 applications had been accepted, with an average financing rate of around 19%, over that period.",0,[]
"In 1993, 83 applications had been accepted and the level of aid was 10%.",0,[]
"From 1981 to 1985, 305 applications had been [granted] and aid amounting to ITL 5 790 million (EUR 2.9 million) had been disbursed (contested decision, section II).",0,['aid disburse decision']
"I - 4128 ITALY v COMMISSION 12 According to the information sent by the Italian Government to the Commission [of the European Communities] after the initiation of the administrative procedure, aid granted under Article 6 of Law No 4/1985 was for investment in the combined transport sector (section II, seventh paragraph, of the contested decision).",0,[]
"According to the contested decision (point VIII, seventh paragraph), that aid was between 10% to 15% of the total amount of aid allocated.",0,[]
"By letter of 14 February 1997 the Commission informed the Italian Government of its decision to initiate the procedure provided by Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the system of aid for commercial road hauliers laid down by Law No 4/1985 and Law No 28/1981 (OJ 1997 C 98, p.",0,['<ORG> inform Government']
"It asked the Italian authorities and interested third parties to submit their observations and furnish all documents, information and data required in order to examine the compatibility of the aid in question with the common market.",0,['it ask authority']
"The Commission received the Italian Government's observations on 3 April 1997 ... 17 On 30 July 1997, the Commission closed the proceeding by adopting the contested decision.",0,"['<ORG> receive Italian Governments observation', '<ORG> close proceeding']"
"...' 4 Section VI of the reasons for the contested decision states that, since the aid in dispute seeks to improve the competitive position of commercial road haulage companies in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region (hereinafter 'the Region'), by reducing their normal business running costs, whereas such costs have to be borne in full by their competitors outside the region, it benefited those companies and that specific activity in such a way that it was liable to produce a distortion of competition.",0,['it benefit company panie']
I-4129 JUDGMENT OF 29.,0,[]
"4 - CASE C-298/00 P 5 First, the Commission makes a distinction, in section VII, third to eleventh paragraphs, of the reasons for the contested decision, between the road haulage market at local, regional and national level, on the one hand, and the international road haulage market, on the other.",0,"['case make distinction', '<ORG> make distinction']"
"It points out that the former was not open to Community competition until Regulation No 4059/89 entered into force on 1 July Consequently, aid granted before that date to carriers operating exclusively at local, regional or national level could not affect intra-Community trade and therefore did not constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",0,"['aid affect trade', 'aid affect state aid']"
"However, aid granted to those carriers after that date is State aid for the purposes of that provision, since it was capable of affecting trade between Member States.",0,[]
"With regard to the international road haulage market, the Commission states, in section III, fourth paragraph, of the reasons for the contested decision, that it has been open to intra-Community competition since 1969, when Regulation No 1018/68 entered into force.",0,[]
"It infers from this, in section VII, last paragraph, of those reasons, that the aid provided for by Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 had strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-à-vis their competitors since 1969 for companies engaged in international transport and was accordingly capable of affecting trade between Member States.",0,['aid strengthen position']
That aid therefore constitutes State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and the local or limited nature of the competition represented by the regional hauliers cannot preclude the application of that provision.,0,['nature not preclude application']
"Next, in examining, in section VIII, ninth paragraph, of the contested decision, whether the aid thus characterised as State aid qualifies for a derogation, the Commission considers that the aid granted under Article 6 of Law No 4/1985 for financing equipment designed for combined transport can benefit from the exemption provided for in Article 3(1)(e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.",0,[]
None of the other derogations provided for by that article or by the Treaty was applicable to the other aid granted by the Region.,0,[]
"I-4130 ITALY v COMMISSION 8 Finally, section VIII, last paragraph, of the reasons for the contested decision states that aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 to commercial road haulage companies in the Region engaged in local, regional or national transport operations from 1 July 1990 onwards, as well as to those engaged in international transport operations, is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty.",0,[]
"The Commission therefore concludes, in section IX of those reasons, that, since the Italian Government implemented the aid scheme in question without having fulfilled the obligation to notify it, the scheme should be regarded as illegal and recovery of the aid in question should be regarded as necessary in order to restore the fair conditions of competition which existed before that aid was granted.",0,['<ORG> implement aid scheme']
"The operative part of the contested decision is worded as follows: 'Article 1 Subsidies granted under Laws No 28/1981 and No 4/1985 of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region (hereinafter referred to as ""the subsidies"") up to 1 July 1990 to companies exclusively engaged in transport operations at local, regional or national level do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",0,[]
Article 2 The subsidies not covered by Article 1 of this Decision constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92( 1 ) of the Treaty and are illegal since they were introduced in breach of Article 93(3).,0,['article stitute aid']
I -4131 JUDGMENT OF 29.,0,[]
"4 - CASE C-298/00 P Article 3 The subsidies for financing equipment specifically adapted for, and used solely for, combined transport constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty but are compatible with the common market by virtue of Article 3(1)(e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.",0,['subsidy stitute aid']
"Article 4 The subsidies granted from 1 July 1990 onwards to companies engaged in transport operations at a local, regional or national level and to companies engaged in transport operations at an international level are incompatible with the common market since they do not fulfil any of the conditions for derogation provided for in Article 92(2) and (3) of the Treaty, or the conditions provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.",0,['they fulfil any']
Article 5 Italy shall abolish and recover the aid referred to in Article 4.,0,[]
"The aid shall be reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of domestic law, together with interest, calculated by applying the reference rates used for assessment of regional aid, as from the date on which the aid was granted and ending on the date on which it is actually repaid.",0,[]

"Following the adoption of the contested decision, the Region, which had suspended the granting of the aid in question from 1 January 1996 onwards, abolished the system of aid provided for by Law No 4/1985 and took the steps necessary to recover the aid already disbursed.",0,"['which suspend granting', 'Region abolish system']"

"In support of their claims, they put forward essentially four pleas for annulment.",0,['they put plea']
The first plea for annulment put forward alleged infringement of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.,0,['plea put infringement']
"The applicants maintained that the Commission had erred in law by merely mentioning the simple possibility that trade between Member States might be affected, without demonstrating the existence of a real, concrete risk of distortion of competition.",0,[]
"In this case, since the aid in question was of a modest amount, its recipients engaged in mainly regional operations and it had a compensatory function, that aid was not likely to affect trade between Member States or affect competition.",0,['it have function']
The applicants also complained that the contested decision was vitiated by a failure to state reasons.,0,[]
6 The Court of First Instance rejected that first plea in law on the grounds specified in paragraphs 76 to 106 of the contested judgment.,0,['<ORG> reject plea']
"It is apparent from those grounds, inter alia, that, on the one hand, the Commission was not required to establish that the aid in question had a real effect on trade between Member States and competition, and that, on the other hand, neither the allegedly trivial amount of that aid nor the relatively small size of the recipient undertakings and the fact I - 4134 ITALY v COMMISSION that they operate at a local level necessarily led to the conclusion that the aid in question had no effect on the market and intra-Community trade.",0,['aid have effect']
"Moreover, the complaint concerning inadequacy of the statement of reasons for the contested decision was also rejected by the Court of First Instance on the ground that, in that decision, the Commission had stated, concisely but clearly, the reasons why the aid in question was such as to affect trade between Member States and distort competition.",0,['<ORG> state reason']
"The second plea for annulment put forward by the applicants alleged, firstly, infringement by the Commission of Articles 92(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty and 3(1)(d) of Regulation No 1107/70 so far as concerns the interpretation of the derogating provisions of those articles and, secondly, failure to state reasons for the contested decision in that regard.",0,"['plea allege infringement', 'company cern interpretation']"
"The Court of First Instance rejected that second plea, holding, in paragraphs 124 to 135 of the contested judgment, that the contested decision cannot be regarded as vitiated by an error of law on that point or, moreover, by a failure to state reasons.",0,['<ORG> reject plea']
"The third plea for annulment put forward by the applicants maintained that, since the aid in question had been instituted by laws predating the liberalisation of the transport sector, it should not be classified as new aid, but should be regarded as existing aid.",0,[]
"The Court of First Instance upheld that plea only in so far as it relates to aid granted to undertakings engaged solely in local, regional or national transport and rejected it so far as concerns those operating in the international road haulage I - 4135 JUDGMENT OF 29.",0,"['<ORG> uphold plea', 'company cern those']"
4 — CASE C-298/00 P sector.,0,[]
"The grounds on which the Court of First Instance based its reasoning are the following: '142 According to established case-law, existing aid is aid introduced before the Treaty came into force or before the accession of the Member State concerned to the European Communities and aid which has been properly put into effect under the conditions laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty ([Case C-387/92] Banco Exterior de España [[1994] ECR I-877], paragraph 19, and Case C-295/97 Piaggio [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraph 48).",0,['<ORG> base reasoning']
"Likewise, a system of aid established in a market that was initially closed to competition must, when that market is liberalised, be regarded as an existing aid system, since at the time of its establishment it did not come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, which, having regard to the requirements set out in that provision regarding effect on trade between Member States and repercussions on competition, applies only to sectors open to competition.",0,['it number company e']
"In the present case, as the international road haulage sector had been opened up to competition by Regulation No 1018/68 with effect from 1969, the systems of aid in question, established in 1981 and 1985, came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of their introduction and should therefore be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",0,[]
"I-4136 ITALY v COMMISSION 146 On the other hand, as the cabotage market was liberalised by Regulation No 4059/89 only from 1 July 1990, the systems of aid in question did not, at the time of their introduction in 1981 and 1985, come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, as regards aid granted in the local, regional or national transport sector.",0,['system number company e']
"It follows that aid to undertakings engaged solely in such a type of transport must be classified as existing aid and can be the subject, if at all, only of a decision finding it incompatible as to the future.",0,[]
"Pursuant to Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, the Commission is, as part of its constant review of existing aid, only empowered to require the elimination or modification of such aid within a period which it is to determine.",0,[]
"That aid can, therefore, lawfully be implemented as long as the Commission has not found it to be incompatible with the common market (Case C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1992] ECR I-4145, paragraphs 23 and 25, and Banco Exterior de Esparta, cited above, paragraph 20).",0,[]
"The contested decision must therefore be annulled in so far as Article 2 thereof declares aid granted with effect from 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged solely in local, regional or national transport to be illegal, and in so far as Article 5 requires recovery of that aid.'",0,['article require recovery']
I-4137 JUDGMENT OF 29.,0,[]
"4 - CASE C-298/00 P 21 The fourth plea for annulment put forward by the applicants was based on the fact that Article 4, to which Article 5 of the contested decision refers in providing for the recovery of aid incompatible with the Treaty, unequivocally finds that the aid disbursed from 1 July 1990, a date which applies not only to aid granted to undertakings engaged exclusively in local, regional or national transport, but also to aid granted to those engaged in international road haulage, was incompatible with the common market.",0,['which apply number']
They complain that the Commission acted in breach both of the principles of proportionality and the protection of legitimate expectations and of the obligation to state reasons so far as the recovery of the aid is concerned.,0,[]
"The Court of First Instance also rejected that plea in law, on the grounds set out in paragraphs 162 to 177 of the contested judgment, which are based on the consideration that Article 4 of the contested decision must be interpreted as covering the aid granted to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport from 1 July 1990 onwards and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid systems in question.",0,['<ORG> reject plea']
"The Court of First Instance also held that, since the aid in question had not been notified to the Commission, the applicants had not established the existence of any specific factor which would give grounds for assuming that the obligation to reimburse individual aid granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage was, in view of the effect of such aid on competition, manifestly disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty or any exceptional circumstance of such a kind as to create legitimate expectations as to the lawfulness of such aid paid to undertakings engaged in international road haulage.",0,"['applicant establish existence', 'which give ground']"

"Taking the view that the contested decision is a measure of general application, the Commission claims that it is n o t of individual concern to the applicants which are undertakings which have n o t claimed and can not claim the slightest specific factor by which they are distinguished from other interested undertakings which did not participate in the formal procedure for reviewing the aid in question.",0,[]
"More specifically, that decision did not infringe any of those applicants' specific rights which were different from those of other undertakings in receipt of that aid.",0,['decision infringe any']
"In the Commission's view, that analysis is confirmed by the case-law (see, inter alia, Case 282/85 DEFI v Commission [1986] ECR 2469 and Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219) and is not invalidated by the judgment in Joined Cases C-15/98 and C-105/99 Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission [2000] ECR I-8855).",0,[]
"In particular, the undertaking concerned in the case which gave rise to the latter judgment was in a different position, since it was not only affected by the Commission's decision by virtue of being a potential beneficiary of the aid scheme, 'but also by virtue of being an actual beneficiary of individual aid granted under that scheme, the recovery of which has been ordered by the Commission'.",0,['which give rise']
"The Commission points out, inter alia, that, firstly, the order for recovery of the aid already paid out is only one of the aspects of the contested decision, which continues to apply to all recipients, including those which are only potentially so.",0,[]

"Finally, if all the undertakings which received aid granted under schemes declared illegal and incompatible with the common market and recovery of which was ordered by a Commission decision I - 4142 ITALY v COMMISSION were allowed to bring actions contesting that decision before the Court of First Instance, in cases where those undertakings did not bring actions, any reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the recovery of such aid would be declared inadmissible (see Case C-188/92 TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf [1994] ECR I-833, paragraphs 25 and 26).",0,"['which receive aid', 'undertaking bring action', 'reference declare inadmissible']"

"Where a decision is not of individual concern to a natural or legal person within the meaning of that provision, which is an essential condition for having locus standi in proceedings seeking judicial review of a Community act, such proceedings are inadmissible and that inadmissibility therefore constitutes a ground involving a question of public policy which may, and even must, be raised of its own motion by the Community judicature (see, with regard to a party having no interest in bringing or in maintaining an appeal, Case C-19/93 P Rendo and Others v Commission [1995] ECR I-3319, paragraph 13).",1,"['inadmissibility stitute ground', 'inadmissibility stitute Case', 'party have number interest']"

"By the fourth part of that plea, it maintains that the contested judgment is vitiated by an inadequate statement of reasons as regards the effect of the aid in dispute on that trade.",0,[]

I-4147 JUDGMENT OF 29.,1,[]
"4 - CASE C-298/00 P — Findings of the Court 45 It must be noted in that regard that Article 92(1) of the Treaty defines the aid regulated by it as being any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, in so far as it affects trade between Member States.",1,"['it define aid', 'article define aid', 'it affect trade']"
The procedural rules laid down by the Treaty vary depending on whether aid is existing aid or new aid.,1,[]
"With regard to existing aid, under the provisions of Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, in the context of its constant review of such aid, if, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that that aid is not compatible with the common market having regard to Article 92 of the Treaty, or that such aid is being misused, it is to decide that the State concerned must abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.",1,['market have regard']
"Such aid may therefore be lawfully put into effect as long as the Commission has not found it to be incompatible (see judgments in Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 23 and 25, and Banco Exterior de España, cited above, paragraph 20).",1,[]
"With regard to new aid, Article 93(3) of the Treaty provides that the Commission is to be informed, in sufficient time to enable it to submit its comments, of any plans to grant or alter aid.",1,[]
It then undertakes an initial examination of the planned aid.,1,['it undertake examination']
"If, following that examination, it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the common market, it must without delay initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2 of that article.",1,['it initiate procedure']
"In such circumstances, the Member I - 4148 ITALY v COMMISSION State concerned must not put its proposed measures into effect until the procedure has resulted in a final decision.",1,[]
"New aid is therefore subject to a precautionary review by the Commission and may not, in principle, be put into effect until such time as the latter has declared it compatible with the Treaty.",1,[]
"As the Court of First Instance held inter alia, in paragraphs 77 to 79 of the contested judgment, in the course of the Commission's assessment of new aid which, pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty, is to be notified to it before being put into effect, the Commission is required to establish, not whether such aid has a real impact on trade between Member States and on competition, but whether that aid could affect that trade.",1,"['aid have impact', 'aid company affect trade']"
"If the Commission had to demonstrate in its decision the real effect of aid already granted, such a requirement would have the effect of favouring Member States which grant aid in breach of the obligation to notify laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty, to the detriment of those which do notify aid at the planning stage (Case C-301/87 France v Commission [1990] ECR 1-307, 'Boussac Saint Frères', paragraphs 32 and 33).",1,"['requirement have effect', 'requirement have Case', 'which grant aid', 'which number aid']"

"4 — CASE C-298/00 P documents in the file, that the aid in dispute had no impact on intra-Community trade and competition.",0,[]
"In the first place, due to the fact that, on the one hand, that aid represented a very modest total amount and, on the other hand, the road hauliers of the Region constituted a completely marginal group of the intraCommunity transport sector, the impact of that aid was bound to be absolutely insignificant.",0,"['aid represent total amount', 'road haulier stitute group']"

"In the third place, in the view of Collorigh and Others, the Court of First Instance should have ruled out the possibility that the system of aid in dispute might strengthen the financial position of the recipient undertakings, since the objective of that aid was to compensate for the competition from Austrian, Croatian and Slovenian operators.",0,"['<ORG> rule possibility', 'system strengthen position']"
"The Commission contends, firstly, that the application of a system of aid which is such as to favour not only one undertaking but an entire sector, in particular where the presence of a large number of small undertakings is a feature of the market structure, is bound to affect trade.",0,[]
"As the Court of First Instance rightly points out in paragraph 86 of the contested judgment, in such a context, the effects on competition and trade of even relatively modest aid may not be negligible, and such aid cannot be regarded as of little importance.",0,[]
"Secondly, in the international road haulage sector, there existed in Italy, even before 1969, a certain degree of competition under the bilateral agreements concluded by the Italian Republic.",0,['there exist degree']
"In 1981 and 1985, when the systems of aid in dispute were instituted, the Community quotas allowed all hauliers in possession of the required authorisations to establish any transport link between two Member States and created or strengthened a competitive relationship between undertakings established in different Member States, as the Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 145 of the contested judgment.",0,['haulier establish transport link']
"Indeed, on this same point, the Court of First Instance correctly stated the reasons which led it to consider that the advantages granted to the international road haulage undertakings constitute State aid for the purposes of the Treaty.",0,"['company state reason', 'which lead it', 'advantage stitute state aid']"
"I - 4150 ITALY v COMMISSION — Findings of the Court 54 In the first place, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, the relatively small amount of aid or the relatively small size of the undertaking which receives it do not as such exclude the possibility that intra-Community trade might be affected (see Case C-142/87 Belgium v Commission [1990] ECR I-959, ' Tubemeuse', paragraph 43; Joined Cases C-278/92 to C-280/92 Spain v Commission [1994] ECR I-4103, paragraph 42, and Case C-280/00 Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg [2003] ECR I-7747, paragraph 81).",1,['which receive it']
"Aid of a relatively small amount is liable to affect competition and trade between Member States where there is strong competition in the sector in which the undertakings which receive it operate (see Case 259/85 France v Commission [1987] ECR 4393, paragraph 24, and Case C-351/98 Spain v Commission [2002] ECR I-8031, paragraph 63).",1,"['there be company petition', 'which receive it']"
"The Court of First Instance, having declared that that case-law applied to the present case, was fully entitled to hold, firstly, in paragraphs 84 and 86 of the contested judgment, that the small size of the recipient undertakings and the relatively small amount of aid allocated did not mean that there was no effect on competition and trade where, as in the road haulage sector, the presence of a large number of small-sized undertakings was a feature of the market structure.",1,['there be number effect']
"Secondly, as the Court of First Instance pointed out in paragraph 94 of the contested judgment, although hauliers from the Region played only a small part in that sector, the limited nature of the competition cannot preclude the application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",1,"['haulier play part', 'nature not preclude application']"

"4 - CASE C-298/00 P 56 Since the Italian Republic has not put forward any evidence that the Court of First Instance failed, in this case, to have regard to the principles recognised by the Court of Justice in the case-law mentioned in paragraph 54 of the present judgment, that argument concerning the impact of the aid in dispute on intraCommunity trade and competition must be rejected as unfounded.",1,['Italian Republic put evidence']
"In the second place, the argument put forward by the Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others that the Court of First Instance should have concluded that the international road haulage sector, characterised as it was by the existence of quotas and bilateral agreements, could not yet be regarded as being fully liberalised on the date of the contested decision and that, consequently, the aid in dispute could not be regarded as affecting competition, must be rejected as unfounded.",1,[]
"In paragraph 92 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance noted that, by virtue of the relevant provisions of Regulation No 1018/68, Community authorisations issued in the carrier's name and usable only for one vehicle were granted under national quotas, for a period of one year in the case of international road haulage, holders of an international road haulage authorisation being entitled, during those periods of validity, to transport goods without limitation, with one vehicle, between Member States of their choice.",1,[]
"The Court of First Instance was therefore fully entitled to conclude that the quota schemes in force on the international road haulage market from 1969 to 1993 allowed the introduction, within the limit of the quotas laid down, of an effective competitive situation which was capable of being affected by the grant of the aid in dispute.",1,['quota scheme allow introduction']
"I - 4152 ITALY v COMMISSION 60 In that regard, the Court of First Instance was also fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 96 of the contested judgment, that, even assuming that the Community quota had been exhausted, that factor would not necessarily have led to the conclusion that the aid in dispute had no effect on intra-Community trade and competition.",1,[]
"In view of the free choice given by quota schemes to holders of Community authorisations as regards the Member States between which they may provide international haulage services, exhaustion of the quotas would in any event not furnish any information as to the use made of them, in particular in the case of such haulage services from or to Italy or, more specifically, the Region.",1,"['they provide haulage service', 'exhaustion furnish information', 'number furnish information']"
"In the third place, according to settled case-law, the fact that a Member State seeks to approximate, by unilateral measures, conditions of competition in a particular sector of the economy to those prevailing in other Member States cannot deprive the measures in question of their character as aid (Joined Cases 6/69 and 11/69 Commission v France [1969] ECR 523, paragraphs 20 and 21, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 21).",1,['fact not deprive measure']
"It follows that the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to hold, in paragraph 101 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute could be justified neither by the existence of higher discount rates in Italy nor by competition from operators established in Austria, Croatia or Slovenia.",1,[]

"— Findings of the Court According to settled case-law, correctly cited by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 169 of the contested judgment, abolishing unlawful aid by means of recovery is the logical consequence of a finding that it is unlawful.",1,[]

"In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance was fully entitled to conclude, in paragraph 170 of the contested judgment, that no specific evidence had been put forward to show that the obligation to reimburse the aid in dispute is disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty.",1,[]
"Accordingly, the first part of the second plea in law, by which the Italian Republic alleges that the Court of First Instance failed to observe the principle of proportionality, must be rejected.",1,[]
"I-4158 ITALY v COMMISSION The second part of the second plea in law, alleging breach of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations — Arguments of the parties 81 Although the Italian Republic does not dispute the Court's case-law which, in general, does not permit a Member State which has granted aid incompatible with the common market to plead the legitimate expectations of the recipients in order to avoid the obligation to recover that aid, it does claim, by the second part of its second plea in law, that that principle could be reformulated, in particular in cases such as this where the measure has been applied over a very long period without giving rise to any objection and has even been lawful and compatible with the Treaty for a large proportion of that period.",0,"['Italian Republic dispute <ORG>', 'which permit member State', 'which grant aid']"
"The Italian Republic maintains, firstly, that a limitation, by the operative part of the contested decision, of the temporal effect of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute would be justifiable in this case, since that was aid which had been instituted and paid out for more than 14 years at the time when the Commission initiated the procedure, namely in November 1995, and, secondly, that the contested judgment constitutes a reformatio in pejus of that decision, thus failing to observe the principles of the protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.",0,"['<ORG> initiate procedure', 'judgment company stitute reformatio']"
"It is precisely to prevent the adoption of acts regarding legal and economic situations which have been consolidated over time that Article 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty (OJ 1999 L 83, p.",0,['Article lay rule']
) rightly provides that the power of the Commission to act to recover illegal aid is to be subject to a limitation period of 10 years which starts to run from the date on which the aid was granted.,0,[]
"Although that provision is not applicable, ratione temporis, to this case, some helpful criteria may be drawn from it for the purpose of placing reasonable limits on the temporal scope for recovery of the aid in dispute.",0,[]

"4 - CASE C-29S/00 P 83 Collorigh and Others concur with that view, while pointing out that the assertion by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 173 of the contested judgment, that the undertakings in receipt of that aid were precluded from relying on any exceptional circumstances on the basis of which they might legitimately have assumed that aid to be lawful, and therefore from declining to repay it, is incorrect.",0,[]
"In their opinion, the Court of First Instance took into account many factors which could certainly be described as exceptional circumstances.",0,['<ORG> take factor']
"The Commission replies that, in paragraphs 172 and 173 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance rightly refused to find that there were exceptional circumstances of such a kind as to create legitimate expectations as to the lawfulness of the aid in dispute.",0,['there be circumstance']
"In the Commission's view, the Italian Republic has not put forward any convincing argument to refute that conclusion.",0,['Italian Republic put company vincing argument']
"First, in the absence of any limitation period, the claim that the measures had been applied for 10 or 14 years when the Commission initiated the formal review procedure is irrelevant and the reference to Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 is misplaced.",0,['<ORG> initiate review procedure']
"Second, it is wrong to claim that the measure in question was 'lawful and compatible with the Treaty for a long period of time'.",0,[]
"On the contrary, that measure was never lawful since it was not notified.",0,[]
"Moreover, when the Commission had the opportunity to examine it, it found it to be incompatible with the common market and its decision was confirmed by the contested judgment which is not criticised in that respect.",0,['<ORG> have opportunity']
"Finally, contrary to what is claimed by the Italian Republic, that incompatibility did not occur suddenly but characterised the aid in dispute from the date on which it was instituted.",0,[]
— Findings of the Court 86 It must be pointed out that a recipient of illegally granted aid is not precluded from relying on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful and thus declining to refund that aid.,1,[]
"If such a case is brought before a national court, it is for that court to assess the material circumstances, if necessary after obtaining a preliminary ruling on interpretation from the Court of Justice (Case C-5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I-3437, paragraph 16, and Case C-310/99 Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 103).",1,['company rt assess circumstance']
"In the present case, the Court of First Instance first of all found, in paragraph 172 of the contested judgment, that the aid in dispute had been granted without having been notified to the Commission beforehand, contrary to the obligation imposed on Member States by Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",1,[]
"Secondly, the Court of First was fully entitled to conclude, in the same paragraph of the contested decision, that the fact that the recipient undertakings are small undertakings cannot justify a legitimate expectation on their part as to the lawfulness of that aid.",1,['fact not justify expectation']
"Finally, in so far as the Italian Republic claims that, since the recipient undertakings had relied on the lawfulness of aid instituted and paid out over many years, the Court of First Instance should have concluded that that long period had given rise to legitimate expectations on the part of those recipients with regard to recovery of the aid in dispute, which, as the Court of Justice has already held, justified a temporal limitation of the power held by the Commission, it is sufficient to reply that, in order to fulfil its function, such a limitation period must be fixed in advance, the fixing of its duration and the detailed rules for its application coming within the powers of the Community legislature (see, to that effect, Case 52/69 Geigy v Commission [1972] ECR 787, paragraph 21).",1,"['period give rise', 'which justify limitation']"
"On the date of the contested decision, the latter had not yet acted to fix a period of limitation in connection with the monitoring of aid granted under the Treaty, since Regulation No 659/1999, having only entered into force on 16 April 1999, does not apply to the facts of this case.",1,[]

"4 — CASE C-298/00 P 90 However, the fundamental requirement of legal certainty has the effect of preventing the Commission from indefinitely delaying the exercise of its powers (see Geigy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 20 and 21, and Joined Cases C-74/00 P and C-75/00 P Falck and Acciaierie di Bolzano v Commission [2002] ECR I-7869, paragraph 140).",1,['requirement have effect']
"In that regard, a delay by the Commission in deciding that an aid is illegal and must be abolished and recovered by a Member State could in certain circumstances establish a legitimate expectation on the part of the recipients of that aid so as to prevent the Commission from requiring that Member State to order the refund of the aid (see Case 223/85 RSV v Commission [1987] ECR 4617, paragraph 17).",1,"['delay establish expectation', '<ORG> order refund']"
"However, the facts of the case giving rise to that judgment were exceptional and bear no resemblance to those in the present case.",1,[]
"The measure at issue in that judgment concerned a sector which had for some years been receiving State aid approved by the Commission and its object was to meet the additional costs of an operation which had already received authorised aid (Case C-334/99 Germany v Commission [2003] ECR I-1139, paragraph 44).",1,"['measure cerne sector', 'company cerne sector', 'which receive <ORG>', 'which receive aid']"
"In any event, in the case of State aid that has not been notified, such a delay may be imputed to the Commission only from the time when it learned of the existence of the aid incompatible with the common market.",1,[]
"In this case, it is common ground that the Commission learned of the aid in dispute only in September 1995.",1,[]
"In view, firstly, of the fact that such aid had not been authorised by the Commission and, secondly, of the fact that the Commission was not aware of the complex situation in which that aid had been granted, it was therefore necessary, before reaching a decision, to carry out an investigation.",1,[]
"In those circumstances, the time which elapsed between September 1995 and the date of adoption of the contested decision, namely 30 July 1997, is reasonable.",1,[]
"Consequently, the Court of First Instance cannot be considered to have failed to observe the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations in that regard.",1,[]
"Accordingly, the second p a r t of the second plea in law must be rejected.",1,[]
"The third part of the second plea in law, relating to the extent of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute — Arguments of the parties 94 By the third part of its second plea in law, the Italian Republic maintains that Article 4 of the contested decision, to which Article 5 refers in providing for recovery of the aid incompatible with the Treaty, makes no distinction between the aid to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport and the aid to those engaged in international road haulage and that Article 4 unequivocally finds that all the aid paid out from 1 July 1990 onwards by the Region is incompatible.",0,['article make number distinction']
"Consequently, the principle that, in circumstances where the operative part of a decision is equivocal, it is possible to make reference to the reasons for that decision is irrelevant in this case.",0,[]
"The Commission replies that it is not clear whether the date of 1 July 1990, mentioned in Article 4 of the contested decision, refers only to the subsidies granted to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport or whether it also refers to those granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage.",0,[]
"However, as the Court of First Instance correctly pointed out in paragraphs 163 and 164 of the contested judgment, the reasons for the contested decision dispel any doubt in that regard and make it clear that the temporal limit of 1 July 1990 applies only to the aid granted to the first category of undertakings and does not concern the undertakings in the second category.",0,['reason dispel doubt']
"Indeed, the analysis set forth by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 165 of that judgment, which is based on taking the operative part of the contested decision as a whole into consideration, invalidates that view put forward by the Italian Republic.",0,['analysis invalidate view']
I - 4163 JUDGMENT OF 29.,0,[]
"4 - CASE C-298/00 P — Findings of the Court 96 Contrary to what the Italian Republic claims, the Court of First Instance, in paragraph 164 of the contested judgment, rightly found that Article 4 of the contested decision is worded equivocally as regards the requirement of recovery, which could refer either to all the aid in dispute granted since its introduction or only to the aid granted from 1 July 1990 onwards.",1,[]
"In any event, it should be pointed out that, in paragraph 163 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance started from the general principle that the operative part of an act is indissociably linked to the statement of reasons for it, so that, when it has to be interpreted, account must be taken of the reasons which led to its adoption (see, inter alia, Case C-355/95 P TWD v Commission [1997] ECR I-2549, paragraph 21, and Case C-404/97 Commission v Portugal, cited above, paragraph 41).",1,[]
"In that regard, in paragraphs 164 and 166 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance concluded, firstly, that, in the light of the reasons for the contested decision, and in particular section VIII, last paragraph, of those reasons, Article 4 of that decision must be interpreted as meaning that the aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 with effect from 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid in dispute are incompatible with the common market.",1,['that grant to']
"Secondly, in paragraph 165 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance held that that interpretation is clear from a reading of the operative part of the contested decision taken as a whole.",1,[]
Such an analysis does not reflect an error of assessment on the part of the Court of First Instance.,1,['analysis reflect error']
"I - 4164 ITALY v COMMISSION 100 It follows that the third part of the second plea in law, relating to the extent of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute, must be rejected.",1,[]
