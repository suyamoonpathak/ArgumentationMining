"The Commission began with small communities or small Member States, with limited scope for decisions and action.",0,"['commission begin munitie', 'commission begin scope']"

It is in doubt as to the reasons which led the Commission to initiate a large number of procedures against the Normas Forales of the Basque Country.,0,"['which lead commission', ' to initiate number']"
"It also is in doubt as to why a series of fiscal measures were removed from the list drawn up by a group called 'Primarolo', responsible within the Council for detecting fiscal measures to be abolished for the purposes of tax harmonisation, only to be subsequently challenged through the State aid procedures.",0,"['series be remove list', ' draw group', ' call primarolo', ' detect measure', ' to be abolish purpose', ' to be challenge procedure']"

That is why the Commission chose the quicker and simpler route of State aid procedures.,0,['commission choose route']
The Territorio Histórico de Álava also complains that the Court of First Instance failed to state grounds as regards the plea alleging misuse of powers.,0,"['lava plain ', 'court fail ', ' to state ground', ' regard plea', ' allege misuse']"
"The Court gave a fairly superficial answer, refraining from discussion of the reasons why the Commission initiated a large number of procedures against the Normas Forales of the Basque Country and failing to establish why the abovementioned series of fiscal measures was removed from the list by the Primarolo group only to be challenged through the State aid procedures.",0,"['court give answer', ' refrain discussion', 'commission initiate number', 'series be remove list', 'series be remove group', ' to be challenge procedure']"

"It is thus founded not on relevant evidence, as is required by case-law, but on purely subjective assertions concerning the Commission's supposed intentions.",0,"['it be found evidence', ' be require law', ' cerne intention']"
"In reality, in relation to its plea, Ramondin merely reiterates its extremely narrow interpretation of what constitutes aid and of the criterion of selectivity.",0,"['ramondin reiterate interpretation', 'company stitute aid']"
The alleged misuse of powers consists only in an interpretation of 'aid' which differs from that advocated by Ramondin.,0,"['misuse sist interpretation', 'which differ that', ' advocate ramondin']"
"In reply to the arguments of the Territorio Histórico de Álava, the Commission submits that the plea alleging misuse of powers was not invoked by the appellant before the Court of First Instance.",0,"['commission submit ', ' allege misuse', ' invoke appellant', ' invoke court']"
This ground of appeal is thus manifestly inadmissible.,0,[]
"In any event, it is unfounded, for the same reasons as those invoked vis-à-vis Ramondin.",0,[' invoke ramondin']
"Finally, the Court of First Instance adequately stated the grounds of the judgment under appeal for the purpose of rejecting the plea.",0,"['court state ground', 'court state appeal', 'court state purpose', ' reject plea']"

That plea was examined with regard to Ramondin and the Territorio Histórico de Álava at paragraphs 82 to 88 of the judgment under appeal.,1,"['plea be examine regard', 'plea be examine paragraph', 'plea be examine appeal']"
"The Court of First Instance rightly observed that a measure is only vitiated by misuse of powers if it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been taken with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving an end other than that stated (see, inter alia, Case C-110/97 Netherlands v Council [2001] ECR 1-8763, paragraph 137 and the cases cited).",1,"['court observe ', 'measure be vitiate misuse', 'it appear basis', ' to have be take purpose', ' achieve end']"
"At paragraphs 85 to 87, it analysed and assessed the applicants' allegations and their arguments.",1,"['it analyse ', 'it assess allegation']"

"In doing that, the Court of First Instance undertook an assessment of the facts which does not, unless the clear sense of the evidence produced to it was distorted, constitute a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see inter alia Joined Cases C-280/99 P to C-282/99 P Moccio, Irme and Others v Commission [2001] ECR 1-4717, paragraph 78, and Joined Cases C-238/99 P, C-244/99 P, C-245/99 P, C-247/99 P, C-250/99 P to C-252/99 P and C-254/99 P Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I- 8375, paragraph 285).",1,"[' do that', 'court undertake assessment', 'which do number ', ' produce it', 'sense be distort ', ' stitute question', ' see cases', ' see commission']"
"The appellants confine themselves, by assertions, to challenging those findings of fact.",1,"['company fine themselves', 'company fine assertion', ' challenge finding']"
They do not produce any evidence such as to establish that the Court of First Instance distorted the clear sense of the evidence produced to it.,1,"['they do produce evidence', 'court distort sense', ' produce it']"
In any event it cannot be maintained that the Court of First Instance should have concluded from the absence of any complaint from a competitor that the Commission's objectives were other than those stated.,1,"['it can be not maintain ', ' have clude absence']"
The mere fact that there was no complaint does not admit of such a hypothesis.,1,"['there be plaint', 'fact do admit hypothesis', 'number do admit hypothesis']"
It follows that the ground of appeal alleging misuse of powers must be rejected.,1,"['it follow ', ' allege misuse', 'ground must be reject ']"
"As regards the ground of appeal based on a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on this point, it must be held that Ramondin did not raise that plea in its appeal.",1,"[' regard ground', ' base failure', ' to state ground', ' to state point', 'it must be hold ', 'ramondin do raise plea', 'ramondin do raise appeal']"
"so In stating, in its pleading lodged on 18 February 2004, that it was maintaining its ground of appeal concerning the failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal in relation to the plea alleging misuse of powers, Ramondin is thus, in reality, introducing a new plea in law.",1,"[' state pleading', ' lodge february', 'it be maintain ground', ' cerne failure', ' to state ground', ' allege misuse', 'ramondin be introduce plea', 'ramondin be introduce law']"
That plea is inadmissible under Articles 42(2) and 118 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice.,1,[]
"I - 10676 RAMONDÍN AND OTHERS v COMMISSION 51 As regards the Territorio Histórico de Álava, which put forward a ground of appeal concerning failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal and maintained it in its pleading lodged on 20 February 2004, it is to be noted that that judgment states: — at paragraph 85, that all the applicants' arguments were based on speculation regarding possible underlying reasons for the contested decision and that they had not even shown that any harmonisation had in fact been achieved at Community level by the contested decision; — at paragraph 86, that the Territorio Histórico de Álava referred to the cases which gave rise to the order of the President of the Court of Justice of 16 February 2000 in Joined Cases C-400/97 to C-402/97 Juntas Generales de Guipúzcoa and Others [2000] ECR 1-1073, cases in which the Commission, in the applicant's submission, undermined the legislative capacity of the Basque authorities in the field of taxation in finding that the Normas Forales constituted State aid since they were applicable exclusively to a particular area of a Member State; — at paragraph 87, that the last-mentioned argument had to be rejected, since in the contested decision the Commission had not taken the criterion of regional selectivity as a basis for establishing that the tax advantages from which Ramondin benefited constituted State aid falling within the scope of Article 92 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 87 EC).",1,"[' regard lava', 'which put company', 'which put appeal', ' cerne failure', ' to state ground', 'which maintain it', 'which maintain pleading', ' lodge february', 'judgment state paragraph', 'argument be base speculation', ' regard reason', 'they have show ', 'harmonisation have be achieve level', 'harmonisation have be achieve decision', 'harmonisation have be achieve paragraph', 'lava refer case', 'which give rise', 'which give order', 'commission undermine capacity', 'company stitute aid', 'company stitute paragraph', 'argument have ', 'commission have take criterion', 'commission have take basis', 'ramondin benefit company', 'advantage stitute aid', ' fall scope']"
That statement of the grounds appears adequate in the light of the arguments presented before the Court of First Instance in the application and the reply.,1,"['statement appear adequate', 'statement appear light', ' present court', ' present application']"
Those arguments did not include any reference to withdrawal of a series of tax measures from a list drawn up by a group set up within the Council.,1,"['argument do include reference', ' draw group', ' set council']"
It follows that the Territorio Histórico de Álava's ground of appeal concerning a failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal so far as concerns the alleged misuse of powers on the part of the Commission must be rejected.,2,"['it follow ', ' to state ground', 'company cern misuse', 'failure must be reject ']"
"The grounds of appeal whereby the Territorio Histórico de Álava alleges, first, incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measures as State aid incompatible with the common market and, second, failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on that point Arguments of the parties 54 Before the Court of First Instance, the Territorio Histórico de Álava maintained that the Commission had infringed Article 92 of the Treaty by considering the tax credit of 45% and the reduction in the basis of assessment to corporation tax to be State aid incompatible with the common market on the ground that Normas Forales 22/1994 and 24/1996 constituted specific measures favouring 'certain undertakings'.",0,"['lava allege categorisation', ' to state ground', ' to state point', 'lava maintain ', 'commission have infringe article', 'commission have infringe ground', 'company sidere credit', 'company stitute measure', ' favour undertaking']"
"It claimed that, in any event, any selective nature which those measures might have was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system.",0,"['it claim ', 'measure might have ', 'nature be justify nature']"
"The Territorio Histórico de Álava complains that the Court of First Instance, at paragraphs 23 to 65 of the judgment under appeal, rejected that argument and thus erred in law in applying Article 92 of the Treaty.",0,"['company plain ', 'court reject argument', 'court err law', ' apply article']"
"In the pleading which it lodged on 20 February 2004, it states that it maintains its ground of annulment, but at an earlier stage than that of the categorisation of the impugned tax measures as State aid.",0,"['it lodge february', 'it state ', 'it maintain ground', 'it maintain stage']"
"It claims that during the proceedings at first instance it maintained that those measures were outside the scope of Article 92 of I - 10678 RAMONDlN AND OTHERS v COMMISSION the Treaty, in so far as, as tax measures, they were justified for the purpose of attaining an economic-policy objective.",0,"['it claim ', 'it maintain ', 'they be justify purpose', ' attain objective']"
The Court of First Instance took the view that that did not preclude its categorisation as State aid incompatible with the Treaty.,0,"['court take view', 'that do preclude categorisation']"
That conclusion is incorrect because it was formulated at an inappropriate point in the interpretation process.,0,['it be formulate point']
"In reality, the Court of First Instance should, before addressing any question of categorisation as State aid, have considered that tax measures adopted before the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy (OJ 1998 C 2, p.",0,"[' address question', 'court should have sidere measure', ' adopt policy', ' adopt clusion']"
") and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation (OJ 1998 C 384, p.",0,[' relate taxation']
) were excluded from the review of State aid.,0,[' be exclude review']
"Where such measures formed part of the industrial policy implemented by the Member State concerned, they should have been excluded from the outset from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty.",0,"['measure form part', ' implement company', 'they should have be exclude outset', 'they should have be exclude scope']"
"In the same pleading, the Territorio Histórico de Álava further states that it also maintains its ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal as regards the point of law raised.",0,"['lava state ', 'it maintain ground', ' allege failure', ' to state ground', ' to state appeal', ' regard point']"
"The Commission contends that, in its present form, the ground of appeal alleging incorrect categorisation of the impugned tax measures as State aid incompatible with the common market, notwithstanding the amended form in which it is presented, still requires an examination by the Court of the question of the nature as aid of those measures.",0,"['company tend ', ' allege categorisation', ' withstand form', 'it be present ', 'ground require examination']"
The analysis carried out pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty contains no stage preceding that of the discussion of whether the measure in question must be categorised as State aid; the fiscal nature of a measure is of no relevance to the determination of whether or not it constitutes aid.,0,"['analysis tain stage', ' precede that', 'measure must be categorise aid', ' stitute aid']"
Nor could the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy and the code of conduct annexed thereto alter the allocation of powers established in the Treaty.,0,"[' alter allocation', ' establish treaty']"
"In those circumstances, by disputing the competence of the Commission, the Territorio Histórico de Álava is persisting in challenging the categorisation as State aid of the impugned tax measures.",0,"[' dispute petence', 'lava be persist ', ' challenge categorisation', ' challenge aid']"

"4 — JOINED CASES C-186/02 P AND C-188/02 P 59 The Comunidad Autónoma de La Riója submits that the Territorio Histórico de Álava is in actual fact maintaining that the impugned fiscal measures do not constitute State aid, although it is now putting forward new arguments in support of its proposition.",0,"['rija submit ', 'lava be maintain ', ' be put argument', ' be put support']"
The Court should thus not exclude an examination and categorisation of those measures in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.,0,"['court should number light', ' exclude examination']"
"Findings of the Court 60 It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.",1,"['it must be bear mind', 'party to put plea', 'party to put time', 'party to put court', 'it have ', 'number raise court', 'it to bring case', 'it to bring court', 'which come court']"
"In an appeal the Court's jurisdiction is confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Bmzzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59, Case C-7/95 P John Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I-3111, paragraph 62, and Case C-217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I-3701, paragraph 37).",1,"['jurisdiction be fine ', ' argue court', ' see case']"
"In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that: — the impugned tax measures are precluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid; — Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.",1,"['company tend instance', 'measure be preclude scope', 'article have apply provision', 'article have apply clusion', ' relate taxation']"
"In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the measure reducing the basis of assessment in the course of argument concerning the selectivity of that measure, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measures as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.",1,"['it refer objective', 'it refer stage', ' reduce basis', ' cerne selectivity', ' cerne categorisation']"
The Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal.,1,"['court examine argument', 'court examine paragraph', 'court examine appeal']"
"The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the tax measure at issue was excluded at the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.",1,"[' submit court', ' submit appeal', 'measure be exclude outset', 'measure be exclude stage', 'measure be exclude scope', ' precede reasoning', 'company stitute plea', ' raise time', ' raise appeal']"
"This new plea must be declared inadmissible, as must the ground of appeal alleging failure to state the grounds of the judgment under appeal on the point of law raised, since the latter cannot be dissociated from the former.",1,"['plea must be declare inadmissible', ' allege failure', ' to state ground', 'latter can be not dissociate former']"
It follows from all of the foregoing that the appeals must be dismissed.,2,"['it follow all', 'appeal must be dismiss ']"
