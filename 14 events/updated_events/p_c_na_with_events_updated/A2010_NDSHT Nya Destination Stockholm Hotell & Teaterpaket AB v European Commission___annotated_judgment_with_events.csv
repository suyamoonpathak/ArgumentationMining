"It offers a packaged service including hotel reservations and a tourist card called ‘Stockholm à la carte’, which gives holders access to a number of services and facilities in Stockholm, such as museums and local transport.",0,"['it offer service', ' include reservation', ' call carte', 'which give access']"
Stockholm Visitors Board AB (‘SVB’) is a company owned by the City of Stockholm through various subsidiaries.,0,"[' own city', ' own subsidiary']"
It is responsible for providing tourist information and promoting the Stockholm region.,0,"[' provide information', ' promote region']"
"In connection with that type of activity, it also pur sues commercial activities consisting, in particular, in the reservation of discounted hotel rooms in Stockholm and the sale of a package of tourist-related services, by means of a card called ‘the Stockholm Card’, offering free admission to places of inter est and facilities in Stockholm.",0,"['it pur ', ' sue company', ' sue reservation', ' call card', ' offer admission']"
"In September 2004, NDSHT sent the Commission information regarding the an nual grants made by the City of Stockholm to SVB for the years 2003 to 2005, alleg ing that those grants constituted State aid granted in infringement of Article 88(3) EC.",0,"['ndsht send information', ' regard grant', ' make city', ' make svb', ' make year', 'company stitute aid', ' grant infringement']"
NDSHT asserted in its complaint that that alleged State aid consisted in yearly I  -  11920 JUDGMENT OF 18.,0,"['ndsht assert plaint', 'company siste judgment']"
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P appropriations from the City of Stockholm’s budget in favour of SVB, the reimburse ment of SVB’s pre-tax losses by its parent company on a regular basis, and preferen tial access to public facilities, such as metered parking managed by that city.",0,[' manage city']
"Accord ing to NDSHT, SVB could use that aid to finance its commercial activities that are, however, in competition with those of other national and international undertakings, thereby distorting competition.",0,"[' e ndsht', 'ld use aid', ' to finance activity', ' distort petition']"
The Commission investigated NDSHT’s complaint in the light of supplementary in formation provided by the latter and by the Swedish authorities in response to re quests for information sent to them by the Commission.,0,"['commission investigate plaint', 'commission investigate light', ' provide latter', ' send commission']"
"On 24 March 2006, the Director of ‘State Aid 1: Cohesion and Competitiveness’, the service in the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition responsible for the file (‘the Director of the Commission service responsible for the file’), sent the follow ing letter to NDSHT: ‘… I would like to inform you that, on the basis of the available information, the com petent services of the Directorate-General for Competition have reached the con clusion that there are not sufficient reasons for continuing the investigation of your complaint.",0,"['director send letter', 'i would like ', ' to inform you', 'service have reach clusion', 'there be reason', 'company tinue investigation']"
"… I  -  11921 NDSHT v COMMISSION According to our analysis, the Stockholm Card and the hotel bookings are (with the exception of the inclusion of parking spaces in the Stockholm Card) carried out on market conditions.",0,"[' accord analysis', ' carry dition']"
These activities are thus not financed from State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.,0,"['activity be finance aid', 'activity be finance meaning']"
"As regards the use of certain parking spaces for free, arguably there is no affectation on trade, or even if there is, such aid has been included in the Stockholm Card since well before Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and would thus constitute existing aid.",0,"[' regard use', 'there be affectation', 'there be ', 'aid have be include card', 'sweden join union', 'sweden join 1995', 'aid would stitute aid']"
"Moreover, this service is since 1 Janu ary 2006 no longer included in the Stockholm Card.",0,[' include card']
"With respect to other activities (the provision of tourism information, etc.",0,[]
"), it appears as if these are covered by the rules on Services of General Economic Interests (SGEI).",0,"['it appear ', ' be ere rule']"
Cross-subsidisation in favour of economic activities does not seem to occur.,0,[]
"In case the compensation for the SGEIs would be classified as State aid, such aid would nevertheless have been provided under the same conditions since well before 1995 and would thus constitute existing aid.",0,"['pensation would be classify aid', 'aid would have be provide dition', 'aid would stitute aid']"
"In summary, the extensive investigations we have undertaken on this complaint sug gest that we are in the presence of existing aid, and not illegal aid, which is in any case compatible with the common market.",0,['we have undertake company']
"Since there are no grounds to institute the ap propriate measures procedure provided for in Article 88(1) of the Treaty, we do not propose to take any further action on this matter.",0,"['there be ground', ' to institute procedure', ' provide article', 'we do propose ', ' to take action']"
…’ I  -  11922 JUDGMENT OF 18.,0,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P 15 By letter of 5 April 2006, NDSHT informed the Commission that it understood the letter of 24 March 2006 as meaning that its complaint had been rejected and a deci sion adopted pursuant to Articles 13 and 4(2) and (3) of Regulation No 659/1999 not to raise any objections with regard to the financial measures in question.",0,"['ndsht inform commission', 'it understand letter', 'plaint have be reject ', 'plaint adopt ', ' to raise objection']"
"NDSHT also asked the Commission to send it a copy of that decision, in accordance with Article 20 of that regulation.",0,"['ndsht ask commission', 'ndsht ask accordance', ' to send y']"
"By letter of 28 April 2006, the Director of the Commission service responsible for the file replied to NDSHT stating that the information received did not indicate that the measures complained of constituted unlawful State aid and consequently no decision by the Commission under Article 20 of Regulation No 659/1999 could be addressed to it.",0,"['director reply ndsht', 'information do indicate ', 'company plain ', 'measure be address it', 'decision be address it']"
"The proceedings before the General Court and the judgment under appeal 17 By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 6 June 2006, NDSHT sought the annulment of the act in question and the initiation of the formal investiga tion procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,"[' lodge registry', ' lodge june', 'ndsht seek annulment']"
"By separate document, the Commission raised an objection of inadmissibility pursu ant to Article 114(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, to which ND SHT responded on 9 November 2006.",0,"['commission raise objection', 'sht respond ember']"
NDSHT claimed in its observations relating to the objection of inadmissibility that the act in question expressed both a final refusal on the part of the Commission to I  -  11923 NDSHT v COMMISSION initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 88(2) EC and a de cision to close the case.,0,"['ndsht claim observation', ' relate objection', 'act express refusal', 'ndsht initiate procedure', ' provide ec', ' to close case']"
The act in question should therefore be regarded as a decision affecting NDSHT’s legal situation.,0,"['act should be regard decision', ' affect situation']"
It thus constituted an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.,0,"['it stitute act', 'it stitute purpose']"
"By the judgment under appeal, the General Court dismissed NDSHT’s action as inad missible and ordered it to pay the costs.",0,"['court dismiss action', 'court order it', ' to pay t']"
"The General Court held that, in order to determine whether the act in question con stituted an act open to challenge, it was necessary to establish, in the light of its sub stance, whether it constituted a decision under Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 or merely an informal communication pursuant to the second sentence of Article 20(2) of that regulation.",0,"['court hold ', ' stitute act', ' to establish light', 'it stitute decision']"
"It stated, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was not obliged to adopt a decision within the meaning of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 in response to every complaint.",0,"['it state paragraph', 'commission be oblige ', ' to adopt decision', ' to adopt response']"
Such an obligation arose only where Article 13 of the regulation was applicable.,0,['obligation arise ']
That was not the case where the complaint concerned existing aid.,0,['company cerne aid']
"In paragraph 64 of the judgment, the General Court considered that an obligation to adopt a decision within the meaning of Article 4 of that regulation fol lowing a complaint concerning existing aid would run counter to the general scheme of the State aid review procedure.",0,"['company sidere ', ' to adopt decision', ' to adopt meaning', ' low company', ' cerne aid', 'obligation would run nter', 'obligation would run scheme']"
It is apparent from the substance of the letters of 24 March and 28 April 2006 (to gether ‘the contested letters’) that the Commission had decided not to pursue the complaint on the ground that the aid in question constituted existing aid covered by the procedure in Article 88(1) EC.,0,"[' to gether letter', 'commission have decide number', 'commission have decide ground', ' to pursue plaint', 'company stitute company']"
"The General Court considered, in paragraph 57 of the judgment under appeal, that, in that case, in the light of settled case-law, the Commission could not be compelled, by means of a complaint, to issue a recommen dation proposing appropriate measures to the Member States pursuant to Article 18 I  -  11924 JUDGMENT OF 18.",0,"['company sidere paragraph', 'number be pelle mean', ' to issue dation', ' propose measure']"

"Furthermore, none of the provisions thereof applicable to existing aid contemplated the possibility of the Commission’s adopting a measure amounting to a decision at the end of the preliminary examination of that aid.",0,"['number template possibility', 'commissions adopt measure', ' amount decision']"
"Finally, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that, since the Commission considered, at the end of its initial examination of the financial measures in question, that they should be regarded as existing aid, the contested let ters could not constitute a refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,"['court state ', 'company sidere end', 'they should be regard aid', 'company test ', 'company stitute refusal', ' to initiate procedure', ' to initiate ec']"
"The General Court consequently concluded that the contested letters had to be re garded not as a decision for the purposes of Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999, but as an informal communication for the purposes of Article 20 thereof.",0,"['company clude ', 'letter have ', ' to be garde number', ' to be garde decision']"
"Therefore, they did not constitute an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.",0,"['they do stitute act', 'they do stitute purpose']"
"Forms of order sought before the Court 26 By its appeal, while disputing the classification of the measures in question by the Commission, NDSHT asks the Court to set aside the judgment under appeal in its entirety then, principally, to grant its application at first instance and order the Com mission to pay the costs or, in the alternative, to declare its action admissible, refer the case back to the General Court and reserve the decision on costs relating to the two proceedings.",0,"['form seek court', ' dispute classification', 'ndsht ask court', ' to set judgment', ' to set entirety', ' to grant application', ' to grant instance', ' order mission', ' to pay t', ' refer case', ' reserve decision', ' relate proceeding']"

The appeal 28 NDSHT raises four grounds in support of its appeal.,0,['appeal raise ground']
The first ground of appeal alleges manifest distortion of the contents of the contested letters.,0,['ground allege distortion']
"By its second ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the General Court erred in law in considering the act in question to be a preparatory act not constitut ing a definitive decision open to challenge in an action for annulment.",0,"['appellant submit ', 'court err law', ' e decision', ' to challenge action']"
"According to its third ground of appeal, NDSHT complains that the General Court erred in law in considering that the position adopted by the Commission should be treated as a rejection of a request for appropriate measures to be taken within the meaning of Article 88(1) EC.",0,"[' accord ground', 'company plain ', 'court err law', 'court err sidering', ' adopt commission', 'position should be treat rejection', 'measure to be take meaning']"
"Finally, by its fourth ground of appeal, NDSHT claims that the General Court also erred in law in holding that the classification, by the Commission, of the financial measures in question as existing aid prevented the rejection of the complaint from being challenged.",0,"['ndsht claim ', 'court err law', 'classification prevent rejection']"
"Such a solution was based on a misinterpretation of Articles 4, 10, 13 and 20 of Regulation No 659/1999.",0,['solution be base misinterpretation']
"Since the second to fourth grounds of appeal are closely linked, it is appropriate to examine them together.",0,"['ground be link ', ' to examine they']"

"It submits that the Commission had, on the contrary, completed its examination and adopted a decision, without however having formalised it, the ob ject of which was to reject the complaint on the ground that the financial aid granted was compatible with the common market.",0,"['it submit ', 'commission have plete examination', 'commission adopt decision', ' having formalise it', ' to reject plaint', ' to reject ground']"
"In that regard, the appellant considers, in its third ground of appeal, that, in para graph 57 et seq.",0,"['company sider ground', 'company sider graph']"
"of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law by clas sifying the position taken by the Commission as a rejection of a request for appropri ate measures to be taken within the meaning of Article 88(1) EC and not as a refusal to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,"['court err law', 'court err ate', ' sifye position', ' sifye rejection', ' take commission', ' to be take meaning', ' to initiate procedure', ' to initiate ec']"
"Likewise, the I  -  11927 NDSHT v COMMISSION General Court wrongly asserted that the Commission could not be obliged by a com plainant to take a decision at the end of the preliminary examination stage.",0,"['ndsht assert ', 'number be oblige plainant', ' to take decision', ' to take end']"
"Furthermore, the appellant claims, in its fourth ground of appeal, that Articles 4, 10 and 13 of Regulation No 659/1999 oblige the Commission, where it examines a com plaint concerning the existence of allegedly unlawful aid, to conclude the preliminary examination stage by adopting a decision, as is stated in Athinaïki Techniki v Com mission, paragraph 40.",0,"['appellant claim ground', 'article oblige commission', 'it examine company', ' cerne existence', ' to clude stage', ' adopt decision', ' be state mission']"
That obligation to take a decision also applies where the preliminary examination stage leads the Commission to believe that there is existing aid.,0,"[' to take decision', 'obligation apply ', 'stage lead commission', 'there be aid']"
The possibility of contesting a Commission letter refusing to initiate the formal investigation procedure on the ground that the contested aid was existing aid was confirmed by the Court in Case C-313/90 CIRFS and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I-1125.,0,"['company test letter', 'company test ground', ' to initiate procedure', 'company test aid', 'possibility be firm court', 'possibility be firm case']"
"Therefore, ac cording to the appellant, the General Court’s interpretation, in paragraph 64 et seq.",0,[]
"of the judgment under appeal, that it would run counter to the general scheme of the State aid review procedure to hold that the Commission necessarily adopts a deci sion under Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999 where it informs a complainant that its complaint concerns existing aid is evidence of a profoundly mistaken view of that procedural system.",0,"['it would run nter', 'it would run scheme', 'commission adopt sion', 'commission adopt article', 'it inform plainant']"
"That interpretation would mean that, by classifying the contested financial measures as existing aid, the Commission could avoid any review by the European Union judicature, which would be clearly unacceptable.",0,"['interpretation would mean ', ' classify measure', ' classify aid', 'company avoid review']"
"The Commission acknowledges, first of all, that the contested letters do not deal with all of the financial measures in question and that it did not, by those letters, take a decision concerning existing aid.",0,"['commission acknowledge ', 'letter do deal all', 'it do take company', ' cerne aid']"
"On the contrary, those letters contain a number of hypothetical, and accordingly not definitive, conclusions not leading moreover to an identical classification of those different measures.",0,"['letter tain number', ' lead classification']"

"Next, the argument put forward by NDSHT that the Commission adopted a decision although without formalising it is inadmissible, since it was not put forward during the proceedings at first instance.",0,"[' put ndsht', 'commission adopt decision', ' formalise it', ' put proceeding', ' put instance']"
"In any event, the Commission contends that it did not adopt a decision and restricted itself to a provisional assessment, the file on the complaint having been closed only in December 2006.",0,"['company tend ', 'it do adopt decision', 'it restrict itself', 'it restrict assessment', 'file having be close december']"
"Furthermore, as regards existing aid, it could not adopt a decision immediately but had, if it considered the measures to be incompatible with the com mon market, first to inform the Member State concerned before possibly proposing appropriate measures.",0,"[' regard aid', 'number adopt decision', 'number have ', 'it sidere measure', ' to inform company', ' to inform cerned', ' propose measure']"
"Since Regulation No 659/1999 does not provide for any spe cific procedure to be followed in such a case, the only possible means of challenging the act in question would have been an action for failure to act.",0,"['number do provide ', 'procedure to be follow case', ' challenge act']"
"Finally, the Commission contests the relevance of the references to CIRFS and Oth ers v Commission and Athinaïki Techniki v Commission since, when it has found that there is existing aid, the Commission is no longer in a position to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",0,"['company test relevance', 'it have find ', 'there be aid', ' to initiate procedure', ' to initiate ec']"
"I  -  11929 NDSHT v COMMISSION Findings of the Court — Admissibility of the argument invoked by NDSHT relating to the fact that the Commission’s decision was not formalised 40 According to the Commission, the argument put forward by the appellant that it concluded its examination of the financial measures in question with a decision that was not formalised was not raised before the General Court and is accordingly inadmissible.",1,"[' invoke ndsht', ' relate fact', 'decision be formalise ', ' accord commission', ' put appellant', 'company clude examination', 'company clude decision', 'that be formalise ', ' be raise court']"
"In that regard, it must be observed that it follows from Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice, in conjunction with Article 113(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, that, on appeal, an appellant may put forward any relevant argument, provided only that the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court is not changed in the appeal (Case C-229/05 P PKK and KNK v Council [2007] ECR I-439, paragraph 66, and Case C-8/06 P Herrero Romeu v Commission [2007] ECR I-10333, paragraph 32).",1,"['it must be observe ', 'it follow article', 'appellant may put argument', 'matter be change case']"
"However, it is clear that, contrary to the Commission’s contention, that argument was indeed included in the application lodged by NDSHT before the General Court, in which it is claimed, in paragraph 29, that ‘it is settled case-law that the form in which acts or decisions are cast has no bearing on the right to challenge them’.",1,"['argument be include application', ' lodge ndsht', ' lodge court', 'it be claim paragraph', 'it be settle ', 'act be cast ', 'form have bearing', ' to challenge they']"
"Therefore, even assuming that that argument was not expressed in the appeal in the same terms as in that application, it does not change the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court.",1,"[' express appeal', ' express term', 'it do change matter']"
I  -  11930 JUDGMENT OF 18.,1,[]
It follows that that argument is admissible.,2,['it follow ']
"The appellant seeks in essence to show, in its second to fourth grounds of appeal, that the General Court erred in law in holding that the contested letters did not have the characteristics of an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.",1,"['appellant seek essence', ' to show ground', 'court err law', 'letter do have characteristic']"
"In that regard, the Court has repeatedly held that an action for annulment for the purposes of Article 230 EC must be available against all acts adopted by the institu tions, whatever their nature or form, which are intended to have legal effects cap­ able of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position (see, inter alia, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 29 and case-law cited, and Case C-362/08 P Internationaler Hilfsfonds v Commission [2010] ECR I-669, paragraph 51).",1,"['court have hold ', ' adopt tion', 'which be intend ', ' to have effect', ' affect interest', ' bring change', ' see techniki']"
"It follows also from settled case-law concerning the admissibility of actions for an nulment that it is necessary to look to the actual substance of the acts challenged in order to classify them (see, in particular, Case 60/81 IBM v Commission [1981] ECR 2639, paragraph 9, and Case C-147/96 Netherlands v Commission [2000] ECR I-4723, paragraph 27).",1,"['it follow ', 'company cerne admissibility', ' to look substance', ' to classify they', ' see case']"
"By contrast, the form in which an act or decision is adopted is in principle irrelevant to the right to challenge such acts or decisions by way of an action for annulment.",1,"['act be adopt ', ' to challenge act', ' to challenge way']"
"It is therefore, in principle, irrelevant for the classification of the act in question whether I  -  11931 NDSHT v COMMISSION or not it satisfies certain formal requirements, namely in particular, that it is duly identified by its author and that it mentions the provisions providing the legal basis for it.",1,"['it satisfy requirement', 'it be identify author', 'it mention provision', ' provide basis']"
"It is therefore irrelevant that the act may not be described as a ‘decision’ or that it does not refer to Article 4(2), (3) or (4) of Regulation No 659/1999.",1,"['act be describe decision', 'act refer article']"
"It is also of no importance that the Member State concerned was not notified of the act at issue by the Commission, infringing Article 25 of that regulation, as such an error is not capable of altering the substance of that act (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraphs 43 and 44 and case-law cited).",1,"['company cerne ', ' infringe article', ' alter substance', ' see athinaki']"
"Furthermore, it is in principle those measures which definitively determine the pos­ ition of the Commission upon the conclusion of an administrative procedure, and which are intended to have legal effects capable of affecting the interests of the com plainant, that constitute acts open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC, and not intermediate measures whose purpose is to prepare for the final decision, which do not have those effects (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 42 and case-law cited).",1,"['which determine ition', 'which be intend ', ' to have effect', ' affect interest', 'that act open', 'that act purpose', ' to prepare decision', 'which do have effect', ' see techniki']"
"With regard to the possible definitive and actionable nature of measures taken by the Commission in the procedure for reviewing State aid, it should be noted, first, that the Commission must, under Article 10(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, carry out an examination where it has in its possession information from whatever source regarding allegedly unlawful aid.",1,"[' take commission', ' take procedure', ' review aid', 'commission must carry examination', 'it have information', 'it have possession', ' regard aid']"
"The examination of a complaint, on the basis of that provision, gives rise to the initiation of the preliminary examination stage under Article 88(3) EC and obliges the Commission to examine, immediately, the possible existence of aid and its compatibility with the common market (see, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 37).",1,"['examination give rise', 'examination give initiation', 'examination oblige commission', ' to examine existence']"
I  -  11932 JUDGMENT OF 18.,1,[]
"0 — CASE C-322/09 P 50 Article 13(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, which is applicable in the context of an examination of a complaint alleging unlawful aid, obliges the Commission to close that preliminary examination stage by adopting a decision pursuant to Article 4(2), (3) or (4) of that regulation, that is to say, a decision finding that aid does not exist, raising no objections or initiating the formal investigation procedure, since that insti tution is not authorised to persist in its failure to act during the preliminary examina tion stage.",1,"[' allege aid', ' oblige commission', ' to close stage', ' adopt decision', 'aid do exist ', ' raise objection', ' initiate procedure', ' to persist failure', ' to act stage']"
"Once that stage of the procedure has been completed the Commission is bound, consequently, either to initiate the next stage of the procedure, provided for by Article 88(2) EC, or to adopt a definitive decision rejecting the complaint (see, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 40 and case-law cited).",1,"['stage have be plete ', 'commission be bind ', ' to initiate stage', ' provide ec', ' to adopt decision', ' reject company', ' see techniki', ' see effect']"
"Where the Commission finds, following examination of a complaint, that the investi gation has revealed no grounds for concluding that there is State aid within the mean ing of Article 87 EC, it refuses by implication to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, Case C-367/95 P Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France [1998] ECR I-1719, paragraph 47).",1,"['commission find examination', ' follow examination', 'gation have reveal ground', 'there be aid', 'there be ing', 'it refuse implication', ' to initiate procedure', ' see effect']"
"As regards the Commission’s finding that the measures complained of constituted existing aid, it should be noted that existing aid is of course subject to the constant review provided for in Article 88(1) EC and must be regarded as lawful so long as the Commission has not found that it is incompatible with the common market (see Case C-44/93 Namur-Les assurances du crédit [1994] ECR I-3829, paragraph 34, and Case C-400/99 Italy v Commission [2001] ECR I-7303, paragraph 48).",1,"[' regard finding', 'company plain ', ' provide ec', 'aid must be regard ', 'commission have find ', ' see case']"
"However, where it receives a complaint relating to allegedly unlawful aid, the Commission, in classify ing the measure as existing aid, subjects it to the procedure provided for by Art­ icle 88(1) EC and thus refuses by implication to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC (see, to that effect, CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraphs 25 I  -  11933 NDSHT v COMMISSION and 26, and Case C-321/99 P ARAP and Others v Commission [2002] ECR I-4287, paragraph 61).",1,"['it receive plaint', ' relate aid', ' e measure', ' e aid', 'commission subject it', 'commission subject procedure', ' provide ec', 'commission refuse implication', ' to initiate procedure', ' see cirfs', ' see effect']"
"Such a decision refusing to initiate the procedure provided for by Article 88(2) EC is definitive and cannot be characterised as a mere provisional measure (CIRFS and Others v Commission, paragraph 26, and, to that effect, Athinaïki Techniki v Commis sion, paragraphs 54 and 58).",1,"[' to initiate procedure', ' provide ec', 'decision can be not characterise measure']"
"In such a situation, the persons intended to benefit from the procedural guarantees afforded by that provision may secure compliance therewith only if they are able to challenge the decision in question before the European Union judicature under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC.",1,"[' to benefit guarantee', ' afford provision', 'person may secure pliance', ' to challenge decision', ' to challenge judicature', ' to challenge paragraph']"
"That principle applies equally, whether the ground on which the decision is taken is that the Commission regards the aid as com patible with the common market or that, in its view, the very existence of aid must be discounted (Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 47) or where it considers that there is existing aid (see, to that effect, CIRFS and Others v Commis sion, paragraph 27, and ARAP and Others v Commission, paragraph 62).",1,"['principle apply ', 'decision be take ', 'commission regard aid', 'commission regard company', 'existence must be discount ', 'it sider ', 'there be aid', 'commission see cirfs', 'commission see effect']"
"That finding is corroborated by Article 20 of Regulation No 659/1999, which governs the rights of interested parties.",1,"['finding be roborate article', 'which govern right']"
"According to the second and third sentences of Art­ icle 20(2) thereof, after obtaining from such an interested party information concern ing alleged unlawful aid or alleged misuse of aid, the Commission will either consider that there are insufficient grounds for taking a view on the case and inform the in terested party thereof or take a decision on a case concerning the subject-matter of I  -  11934 JUDGMENT OF 18.",1,"[' accord sentence', ' obtain company', ' e aid', 'commission will sider ', 'there be ground', ' take view', 'commission inform party', ' take decision', ' cerne matter']"

"It follows that, where the Commission has examined such information and taken a position on it, it takes a decision.",1,"['it follow ', 'commission have examine information', 'commission take position', 'it take decision']"
"Therefore, an action for annulment of a decision not to initiate the procedure pur suant to Article 88(2) EC brought by a party concerned within the meaning of that article, must be considered to be admissible where that party seeks thereby to safe guard the procedural rights available to him under that latter provision (see Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 36 and case-law cited).",1,"[' to initiate procedure', ' bring company', ' cerne meaning', 'action must be sidere ', 'party seek ', ' to guard right', 'action see techniki']"
"In the present case, it is common ground that the Commission examined the appel lant’s complaint in the light of additional information supplied by the latter and the Swedish authorities in response to requests for information sent to them by the Com mission.",1,"['commission examine plaint', 'commission examine light', ' supply latter', ' supply response', ' send mission']"
"On the conclusion of the examination of the complaint, the Commission stated, in its letter of 24 March 2006, that there were not sufficient reasons for con tinuing the investigation and added that it did not propose to take any further action on the matter.",1,"['commission state letter', 'there be reason', 'company tinue investigation', 'commission add ', 'it do propose ', ' to take action']"
"Furthermore, by its letter of 28 April 2006, it stated that the financial measures in question did not constitute unlawful aid.",1,"['it state ', 'measure do number ']"
"Since the Commission concluded that there were not sufficient reasons for continu ing the investigation of the complaint, it follows from the substance of the act in question that that institution formed a definitive opinion on the measures examined, thus expressing its wish to terminate its preliminary examination.",1,"['company clude ', 'there be reason', 'company tinu ', ' e investigation', 'it follow substance', 'institution form opinion', ' express wish', ' to terminate examination']"
"With that finding, as follows from the case-law cited in paragraph 52 of this judgment, it refused by im plication to initiate the formal investigation procedure under Article 88(2) EC.",1,"[' follow law', ' cite paragraph', 'it refuse plication', ' to initiate procedure', ' to initiate ec']"
"The appellant, as an undertaking in competition with the company benefiting from the measures complained of, is without doubt an interested party for the purposes of Article 88(2) EC (see Commission v Sytraval and Brink’s France, paragraph 41, and Case C-319/07 P 3F v Commission [2009] ECR I-5963, paragraph 32), having regard to the definition of that term in Article 1(h) of Regulation No 659/1999.",1,"[' benefit measure', 'company plain ', 'ec see commission', ' have regard']"
"It must therefore be held that the General Court erred in law in holding that the act in question did not have the characteristics of a decision producing binding legal effects such as to affect the appellant’s interests and, in particular, that it did not constitute a decision pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation No 659/1999.",1,"['it must be hold ', 'court err law', 'act do have characteristic', ' produce effect', ' to affect interest', 'it do stitute decision']"
It follows that the act in question must be regarded as an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 230 EC.,1,"['it follow ', 'act must be regard act']"
It follows from the foregoing considerations that the second to fourth grounds raised by NDSHT in support of its appeal must be upheld.,1,"['it follow sideration', ' raise ndsht', ' raise support', 'ground must be uphold ']"
"Moreover, as the Court has pointed out in paragraphs 52 and 60 of this judgment that a decision such as the act in question constituted an act open to challenge even though the Commission found that the measures complained of constituted existing aid, it is no longer necessary to examine the first ground of appeal put forward by the appellant alleging distortion of the contents of the contested letters.",1,"['court have point paragraph', 'court have point company', ' stitute act', 'commission find ', 'company plain ', ' stitute aid', ' to examine ground', ' put appellant', ' allege distortion']"
