"That decision was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ 2005 C 233, p.",0,['decision be publish journal']
"On 7 June 2006, the Commission adopted the contested decision, the operative part of which provides, in Article 1 thereof, that the State aid which the Slovak Republic had implemented for Frucona Koice, amounting to SKK 416 515 990, was incompatible with the common market, and orders, in Article 2 thereof, the recovery of that aid.",0,"['commission adopt decision', 'part provide article', 'republic have implement koice', ' amount skk', 'part order recovery', 'part order article']"
"In the part of that decision relating to the assessment of the existence of State aid, the Commission observed that the arrangement contained identical debt-arrangement conditions for both private creditors and the tax authorities, whereas that latter, by virtue of its status as a preferential creditor in the bankruptcy procedure, was in a legally and economically more advantageous position than private creditors.",0,"[' relate assessment', 'commission observe ', 'company taine dition', 'company taine creditor']"
The Commission then found that the application of the private creditor test made it necessary to establish whether the local Tax Office was 'better off accepting the conditions of the arrangement as proposed by [Frucona Koice] compared with the possible outcome of a bankruptcy procedure or a tax execution procedure'.,0,"['commission find ', 'application make ', ' accept dition', ' propose company', ' pare outcome']"
"In studying the proceeds of a bankruptcy, the Commission took the view that the E report did not constitute a reliable basis as it was founded on the status of Frucona Koice's assets as at 31 March 2004 rather than on that status, inter alia, as at 17 June 2004.",0,"[' study proceed', 'commission take view', 'report do number stitute', 'it be found status']"
The liquidation factors upheld in the E report were thus too low.,0,[' uphold report']
"Furthermore, the method of their calculation was not explained.",0,['method be explain ']
"In addition, in the light of other available estimations, doubt could be cast on the calculation of the various fees involved in the bankruptcy procedure, to be subtracted from the yield realised by the sale of the assets.",0,"[' be cast calculation', ' involve procedure', ' to be subtract yield', ' realise sale']"
"On the basis of the documents available to it, the Commission concluded that 'the sale of the assets in a bankruptcy procedure would, in all probability, have led to a higher yield' than that of the arrangement and that, having regard to the preferential status of the local Tax Office, 'almost the entire yield obtained in the bankruptcy would accrue' to it.",0,"['company clude ', 'sale would have lead yield', ' have regard', ' obtain bankruptcy', 'yield would accrue it']"
The Commission reached the same conclusion with regard to the yield of a tax execution procedure.,0,['commission reach clusion']
"Subsequently, the Commission pointed out that the Directorate-General for Taxation of the Slovak Republic was opposed to the proposed arrangement and excluded the relevance, for the purposes of the application of the private creditor test, of any long-term interests of the State, such as the continuity of the tax revenue for the State originating from the activities of Frucona Koice.",0,"['commission point ', 'general exclude relevance', ' originate activity']"
The Commission concluded that the test of a private creditor in a market economy had not been met and that the measure under examination therefore constituted State aid equivalent to the amount of the debt written off by the local Tax Office.,0,"['company clude ', 'test have be meet ', 'number have be meet ', 'measure stitute aid', 'measure stitute equivalent', ' write office']"

That application was granted by order of the President of the Second Chamber of the Court of First Instance of 11 October 2007.,0,['application be grant order']
"In support of its action, Frucona Koice raised 10 pleas, the fourth of which alleged an error of law and of fact on the part of the Commission, which had found, for the purposes of the designation of the measure at issue as State aid, that the bankruptcy procedure was more favourable than the arrangement procedure and that the test of the diligent private creditor had therefore not been satisfied.",0,"['koice raise plea', 'fourth allege error', 'which have find purpose']"
"By that plea, Frucona Koice submitted, essentially, that the Commission had failed to take into account, having regard to, inter alia, the evidence which it had produced, the duration of the bankruptcy procedure and its impact on the choice which had to be made by a private creditor in the situation of the tax authorities.",0,"['koice submit ', 'commission have fail ', ' to take account', ' have regard', 'it have produce ', 'which have ', ' to be make creditor', ' to be make situation']"
"The General Court, first, held that, since the application of the private creditor test involved complex economic appraisals, the review of the lawfulness of the contested decision had to be restricted to ascertaining whether the Commission had committed a manifest error of assessment.",0,"['court hold ', 'application involve appraisal', 'review have ', 'commission have mitte error']"
"Next, it held that, in the present case, it was necessary to take account, for the purposes of that review, of the Slovak tax authorities' status as a preferential creditor, of the Commission's particularly cautious assessment of the proceeds from the sale of Frucona Koice's assets in a bankruptcy procedure, and of the fact that, unlike the arrangement procedure, the bankruptcy procedure did not provide for remission of the debt.",0,"['it hold ', ' to take account', ' to take purpose', ' to take status', 'procedure do provide remission']"
"In the light of those considerations, the General Court held, in paragraphs 123 to 129 of the judgment under appeal, as follows: '123  First, as regards [Frucona Koice's] argument that the Commission did not take the duration of a bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia and third party reports in this regard into consideration, the Court would point out first of all that, contrary to [Frucona Koice's] submission, the Commission not only stated, in recital 54 of the contested decision, that, according to the Slovak Republic, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure would have been lower than average in the light of the specific circumstances of the case, but also mentions, in recital 40 of the contested decision, that, according to [Frucona Koice], the bankruptcy procedure lasts on average 3 to 7 years in Slovakia.",0,"['court hold paragraph', ' regard argument', 'commission do take duration', 'commission do take sideration', 'court would point ', 'number state recital', ' accord republic', 'court mention recital', ' accord koice', 'procedure last year', 'procedure last slovakia']"
"The Commission stated that [Frucona Koice] based its position on material, statistics and an example of a Slovak company allegedly in a similar situation to its own.",0,"['commission state ', 'koice base position', 'koice base material']"
It cannot therefore be alleged that the Commission ignored that question and [Frucona Koice's] position in this respect.,0,"['it can be not allege ', 'commission ignore question']"
"In addition, as regards the evidence available to the Commission, the Court would point out that the data, which were themselves provided by [Frucona Koice], do not satisfy the requirements of reliability and consistency.",0,"[' regard evidence', 'court would point ', 'which be provide koice', 'datum do satisfy requirement']"
The assessments of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia that [Frucona Koice] submitted to the Commission were general and did not take account of the characteristics of this case.,0,"['koice submit commission', 'assessment do take account', 'assessment do take characteristic']"
"Similarly, some of those assessments were of an approximate nature and, to a certain extent, were inconsistent with one another.",0,[]
"[Frucona Koice] relies on four reports, referred to in paragraph 96 above, in which that duration was assessed variously at 4 years and 8 months, at a period of between 3 years and 7 years, or at more than 6 years.",0,"['koice rely report', ' refer paragraph', 'duration be assess year']"
The other reports to which [Frucona Koice] refers are the Commission reports of 2002 and 2003 on the Slovak Republic's progress towards accession to the European Union.,0,['koice refer ']
[Frucona Koice] submits that in those reports the Commission referred to the concerns and improvements necessary as regards bankruptcy and insolvency procedures in Slovakia.,0,"['koice submit ', 'commission refer cern', ' regard procedure']"
"However, it must be pointed out that those Commission reports relate to the bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia in general and do not take account of the characteristics of this case.",0,"['it must be point ', 'report relate procedure', 'report do take account', 'report do take characteristic']"
"Moreover, the Court observes that [Frucona Koice] failed to refer to the results of the K report in relation to the possible duration of a bankruptcy procedure concerning it.",0,"['court observe ', 'koice fail ', ' to refer result', ' to refer relation', ' cerne it']"
"In [the K report], which [Frucona Koice] itself submitted in this case, that duration was assessed at ""ca.",0,"['koice submit case', 'duration be assess ca']"
"years (depending on conditions and trustee's work)"".",0,[' depend dition']
The Court would point out that not only was that assessment of the duration of such a bankruptcy procedure clearly much more optimistic than the other assessments submitted by [Frucona Koice] but it also referred specifically to [that company].,0,"['court would point ', ' submit koice', 'it refer pany']"
"In addition, as the Commission maintains, where, as is the case here, the number of the debtor's creditors is small and there are assets with a positive liquidation value, the bankruptcy procedure can be carried out in a shorter than average period.",0,"['commission maintain ', 'there be asset', 'procedure can be carry period']"
That is especially true in the present case since it is undisputed between the parties that the Slovak tax authorities' claim over [Frucona Koice] represented approximately 99% of [the latter's] liabilities and that those authorities had the status of a preferential creditor.,0,"['authority claim koice', 'claim represent 99', 'authority have status']"
It follows that the Slovak tax authorities would have had a decisive influence on the duration of the bankruptcy procedure.,0,"['it follow ', 'authority would have have influence']"
"It is true that [Frucona Koice] asserts that the characteristics, the geographical location and the outdated nature of most of its assets would have made it difficult to find a buyer and, therefore, slowed down the course of the bankruptcy procedure.",0,"['koice assert ', 'characteristic would have make ', ' to find buyer', 'characteristic slow company', 'characteristic slow procedure']"
"However, as the Commission stated in recital 88 of the contested decision, several factors, and in particular the fact that some of [Frucona Koice's] production assets found a user after the withdrawal of its licence for the production and processing of alcohol and spirits, tend to show that that assertion ... is unfounded.",0,"['commission state recital', 'some find user', 'some find withdrawal', 'factor tend ']"
... 129	It follows from the foregoing that the Commission did not commit a manifest error in its assessment of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure.',0,['it follow forego']
"Subsequently, the General Court also rejected the other pleas raised by Frucona Koice, consequently dismissing the action brought by that company and ordering it to pay the costs.",0,"['court reject plea', ' raise koice', 'company dismiss action', ' bring pany', 'company order it', ' to pay t']"
"Forms of order sought 37 Frucona Koice claims that the Court should: - set aside the judgment under appeal, in so far as it rejected the fourth and sixth pleas in law; - uphold those pleas as well founded; - refer the case back to the General Court so that it may rule upon the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth pleas in law, so far as they concern the tax execution procedure; and - order the Commission to pay the costs.",0,"['form seek ', ' set judgment', ' set appeal', 'it reject plea', ' uphold plea', 'court should refer case', 'it may rule plea', ' cern procedure', 'it order commission', ' to pay t']"
"The Commission contends that the Court should: - dismiss the appeal, and - order Frucona Koice to pay the costs.",0,"['company tend ', 'court should dismiss appeal', 'court order koice', ' to pay t']"
"Nicolaus - trade contends that the Court should dismiss the appeal, confirm the judgment under appeal and order Frucona Koice to pay the costs.",0,"['company tend ', 'court should dismiss appeal', 'court order koice', ' to pay t']"
"The appeal 40 In support of its appeal, Frucona Koice puts forward two grounds.",0,['koice put ground']
The first ground of appeal alleges that the General Court erred in law in the application of the private creditor test.,0,"['ground allege ', 'court err law', 'court err application']"
"This ground can be divided, essentially, into two parts relating (i) to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure and (ii) to the relevance of experts' opinions for the purposes of the assessment of the liquidation factors.",0,['ground can be divide part']
"By its second ground of appeal, Frucona Koice alleges that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that in the contested decision and distorted the evidence.",0,"['koice allege ', 'court substitute reasoning', 'court substitute that', 'court substitute decision', 'court distort evidence']"
"This ground can be divided, essentially, into four parts relating (i) to the costs of a bankruptcy procedure, (ii) to the duration of such a procedure, (iii) to the caution in the Commission's assessment, and (iv) to the relevance of an outstanding claim following that bankruptcy procedure.",0,"['ground can be divide part', ' relate t', ' follow procedure']"
"It is appropriate to examine, in the first place and together, the first part of the first ground of appeal and the second part of the second ground of appeal, relating to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.",0,"[' to examine part', ' to examine place', ' relate duration']"
"Arguments of the parties 43 By the first part of the first ground of appeal, Frucona Koice submits that the General Court erred in law in the application of the private creditor test.",0,"['koice submit ', 'court err law', 'court err application']"
"Frucona Koice takes the view that, in its assessment, the General Court did not examine the situation in the same way as a private creditor would have done, having regard to the information which would have been available to such a creditor at the time when the arrangement was concluded.",0,"['koice take view', 'court do examine situation', 'court do examine way', 'creditor would have do ', ' have regard', 'arrangement be clude ']"
The General Court confirmed an assessment made a posteriori by the Commission which takes no account of certain risks and waiting periods which would have influenced the decision of a private creditor during the examination of the respective advantages of bankruptcy and arrangement procedures.,0,"['company firm assessment', 'which take account', 'which take risk', 'which would have influence decision', 'which would have influence examination']"
"Specifically, according to Frucona Koice, the General Court confined itself to examining whether the analysis carried out by the Commission contained errors, and not whether that analysis had been carried out with consideration for the point of view of a prudent private creditor.",0,"[' accord koice', 'company fine itself', ' carry company', 'analysis taine error', 'analysis have be carry sideration']"
"Frucona Koice is of the opinion that that test involves examining whether, taking account of the information which reasonably was available at the time when the arrangement was concluded, the measure at issue was manifestly more generous than the solution chosen by a private creditor in a similar situation.",0,"['test involve ', ' take account', ' take information', 'arrangement be clude ', ' choose creditor', ' choose situation']"
"Thus, the General Court ought, first, to have determined whether the information on the duration of a bankruptcy could have influenced the decision-making process of a hypothetical private creditor.",0,['information have influence process']
"Next, it was for the General Court to ascertain whether the Commission had taken that information into account.",0,"['court to ascertain ', 'commission have take information', 'commission have take account']"
"Lastly, the General Court ought to have examined whether it had given proper weight to that information.",0,['it have give weight']
"Frucona Koice considers that, for the purposes of choosing between the different means of recovering a debt, a prudent private creditor would have taken account of the various items of information available in the present case concerning the length of a bankruptcy procedure and the uncertainties connected with that procedure.",0,"['company sider ', ' choose mean', ' recover debt', 'creditor would have take account', 'creditor would have take item', ' cerne length', 'company necte procedure']"
"Consequently, the various reports and documents relating to the bankruptcy procedure in respect of the company Liehofruct, which had previously taken place within the same commercial sector, contained, according to Frucona Koice, legally relevant information which the Commission was required to take into account.",0,"[' relate procedure', 'which have take place', 'which have take sector', 'report taine information', ' accord koice', 'commission be require ', ' to take account']"
"It had failed to do this, thereby committing an error of law which the General Court had failed to censure.",0,"['it have fail ', ' to do this', ' mitte error', 'court have fail ']"
"Frucona Koice states that, in so far as the General Court took the view that the evaluation of the reports compiled by the Commission concerned a question of fact, namely the duration of the bankruptcy procedures, in respect of which the Commission has a margin of discretion, it committed an error of law, the question raised having been that of the impact which that information would have on the assessment which would have been carried out by a prudent private creditor.",0,"['koice state ', 'court take view', ' pile company', 'evaluation cerne question', 'commission have margin', 'company mitte error', 'information would have assessment', 'which would have be carry creditor']"
"By the second part of the second ground of appeal, Frucona Koice submits that, in respect of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, the General Court, inter alia, justified, on the basis of its own reasoning, the Commission's failure to examine those elements.",0,"['koice submit ', 'court justify failure', 'court justify basis', ' to examine element']"
"In paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, it claims, the General Court failed to have regard to the content of the contested decision, since the recitals to which the General Court refers in that paragraph do not purport to express the Commission's position as regards the duration of the various procedures but record the positions of Frucona Koice and of the Slovak Republic.",0,"['it claim ', 'court fail ', ' to have regard', 'court refer paragraph', 'recital purport ', ' to express position', ' regard duration', 'recital record position']"
"In holding, in paragraph 124 of the judgment under appeal, that the data provided by Frucona Koice did not satisfy the requirements of reliability and consistency, the General Court, in order to reject those arguments, unlawfully supplemented the reasoning set out in the contested decision with new grounds.",0,"[' hold paragraph', ' provide koice', 'datum do satisfy requirement', ' to reject argument', 'court supplement reasoning', 'court supplement ground', ' set decision']"
"Furthermore, the General Court's assertion that the Commission had before it several estimates of the likely length of a bankruptcy procedure in Slovakia provides no answer to the arguments set out by Frucona Koice.",0,"['assertion provide answer', 'assertion provide argument', ' set koice']"
"In rejecting, in paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, the relevance of the Commission reports of 2002 and 2003 on the Slovak Republic's progress towards accession to the European Union on the ground that they did not take account of the characteristics of the case, the General Court also put forward an argument on which the Commission had not relied as a basis for the contested decision.",0,"[' reject relevance', ' reject paragraph', 'they do take account', 'they do take characteristic', 'court put argument', 'court put basis', 'commission have rely ']"
"Moreover, that reasoning is not valid because, when it applies the private creditor test, the Commission often relies partly on general information relating to the economic conditions in the Member State concerned.",0,"['it apply test', 'commission rely information', ' relate dition']"
"In observing, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, that one of the reports submitted by Frucona Koice estimated the duration of a bankruptcy procedure at approximately two years, the General Court again sought to provide a reason of its own to explain the failure to take into account the duration of a bankruptcy.",0,"[' observe paragraph', ' submit koice', 'one estimate duration', 'one estimate year', 'court seek ', ' to provide reason', ' to explain failure', ' to take duration', ' to take account']"
"In addition, a duration of two years is still well in excess of the four-month period required in order to obtain funds under an arrangement procedure.",0,"[' to obtain fund', ' to obtain procedure']"
"Likewise, it was solely on the basis of its own reasons that the General Court held, in paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, that if, in the present case, a bankruptcy procedure had taken place, its duration would have been shorter than the average duration of such a procedure.",0,"['court hold paragraph', 'procedure have take place']"
"So far as concerns the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission takes the view that, in respect of the application of the private creditor test, it is necessary to establish whether the payment facilities granted by a Member State would also have been granted by a private creditor or whether it is clear that such a creditor would not have offered comparable facilities.",0,"['commission take view', ' grant state', 'facility would have be grant creditor', 'creditor would have offer facility']"

"In the Commission's opinion, the General Court applied the correct legal test, which consists in establishing whether the public authority has acted in the same way as a private creditor placed in the same situation would have done, in the light of the circumstances, and correctly held that its power of review was limited to revealing manifest errors committed by the Commission in the assessment of the facts.",0,"['court apply test', 'company sist ', 'authority have act way', 'authority have act light', ' place situation', 'creditor would have do ', 'company hold ', 'power be limit ', ' reveal error', ' reveal assessment', ' mitte commission']"
"Lastly, the Commission contends that Frucona Koice's arguments relating to the failure to refer to the private creditor test and to the scope of the review by the General Court of the Commission's assessments concern the manner in which the Commission and the General Court assessed the evidence and thus do not affect the General Court's reasoning relating to the applicable legal test.",0,"['company tend ', ' relate failure', ' to refer test', 'commission assess evidence', 'number do affect reasoning', ' relate test']"
"In respect of the second part of the second ground of appeal, the Commission observes, as a preliminary point, that the assessment of the facts in the light of the private creditor test must be based on an evaluation of all of the relevant factors, whereas Frucona Koice has challenged only the assessment of some of those many factors.",0,"['commission observe point', 'assessment must be base evaluation', 'koice have challenge assessment']"
"So far as concerns the duration of the bankruptcy procedure, the Commission observes that, in paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held, in fact, that the Commission had not, in the contested decision, ignored that issue, but had nevertheless held that, having regard to the information in recitals 17, 40 and 54 of the contested decision, it was unnecessary to regard the duration of the bankruptcy procedure as being a factor militating against the conclusion of such a procedure.",0,"['commission observe ', 'court hold fact', 'commission have ignore issue', 'court have hold ', ' have regard', ' to regard duration', ' militate clusion']"
"In paragraph 124 of that judgment, the General Court did no more than confirm the evidence which the Commission had before it.",0,['commission have it']
"The reference made by the General Court, in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the judgment under appeal, to reports which are not mentioned in the contested decision is merely an obiter dictum.",0,"[' make court', ' make paragraph', ' make report', 'which be mention decision']"
"In paragraph 127 of the judgment under appeal, also, the General Court merely examined the evidence which was before the Commission in order to ascertain whether the latter had made a manifest error of assessment.",0,"['court examine evidence', 'latter have make error']"
"The Commission submits, in this regard, that it is not obliged to respond specifically to every argument put forward by the beneficiary of alleged aid and that it did not develop at length considerations relating to the duration of the bankruptcy procedure since, taking account, in particular, of the local Tax Office's status as a preferential creditor, the issue would not have been such as to worry a hypothetical private creditor.",0,"['commission submit regard', 'it be oblige ', ' to respond argument', ' put beneficiary', 'it do develop sideration', 'it do develop length', ' relate duration', ' take account', ' take status', ' to worry creditor']"
"Consequently, Frucona Koice's arguments raised in the context of the first part of the first ground of appeal, seeking to establish that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the Commission, are unfounded.",0,"[' raise text', 'court substitute reasoning', 'court substitute that']"

"It observes that, for the local Tax Office, the immediate payment by Frucona Koice of its debt would not have been a necessity at the time when it accepted the arrangement proposal.",0,"['it observe ', 'it accept proposal']"
A private creditor in a situation similar to that of the local Tax Office would therefore not have been inclined to relinquish the possibility of having that payment satisfied to a greater extent than that offered under the arrangement.,0,"[' to relinquish possibility', 'payment satisfy extent', ' offer arrangement']"

"That institution, it submits, has a wide discretion in that regard and, in the present case, it assessed the situation of fact before it principally in the light of the complexity of a bankruptcy procedure, of the number of creditors and of the fact that the tax authorities were not only the majority creditor but also the preferential creditor of Frucona Koice.",0,"['it submit ', 'institution have discretion', 'institution have regard', 'it assess situation', 'it assess light']"

"Findings of the Court 67 Frucona Koice alleges, essentially, that the General Court merely reviewed whether the analysis carried out by the Commission included manifest errors of assessment and that it failed to ascertain whether that analysis had been made from the point of view of a private creditor.",1,"['finding allege ', 'court review ', ' carry commission', 'analysis include error', 'it fail ', 'analysis have be make point']"
"In particular, it contends, the General Court failed to review whether the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy might have influenced the decision-making process of a private creditor and whether the Commission had taken that information into account.",1,"['it tend ', 'company tend ', 'court fail ', ' relate duration', 'information might have influence process', 'commission have take information', 'commission have take account']"

"Under Article 107(1) TFEU, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the internal market.",1,"[' provide treaties', ' grant state', ' grant form', 'which distort ', 'which threaten ', ' to distort petition', ' favour undertaking', 'it affect trade']"
"The concept of aid embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, therefore, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (Case C-200/97 Ecotrade [1998] ECR I-7907, paragraph 34, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 15).",1,"['cept embrace benefit', 'which mitigate charge', 'which be include budget', 'which have effect']"
"However, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as 'aid' for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012 in Case C-124/10 P Commission v EDF, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited).",1,"['measure must meet ', ' to be treat aid', ' to be treat purpose', 'dition be meet ', 'company respond dition', 'recipient have obtain advantage', 'which have be make available', 'which have be make see', 'resource see judgment', 'resource see effect']"

"That test, where applicable, is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing whether such aid exists (see, to that effect, Case C-342/96 Spain v Commission [1999] ECR I-2459, paragraph 46; Case C-256/97 DM Transport [1999] ECR I-3913, paragraph 24; and Commission v EDF, paragraphs 78 and 103).",1,"['commission be require ', ' to take account', ' to take purpose', 'aid exist ', ' see paragraph', ' see effect']"
"Such payment facilities constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU where, taking account of the significance of the economic advantage thereby granted, the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty (see, to that effect, Spain v Commission, paragraph 46; DM Transport, paragraph 30, and Commission v EDF, paragraph 79).",1,"['facility stitute aid', 'facility stitute purpose', ' take account', ' take significance', 'undertaking would have obtain facility', 'undertaking would have obtain creditor', 'undertaking would have obtain situation', 'undertaking seek ', ' to recover sum', 'undertaking see effect']"
"It is therefore for the Commission to carry out an overall assessment, taking into account all relevant evidence in the case enabling it to determine whether the recipient company would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from such a private creditor (see, to that effect, Commission v EDF, paragraph 86).",1,"['commission to carry assessment', ' take evidence', ' take account', ' enable it', 'company would have obtain facility', 'company would have obtain creditor', ' see commission', ' see effect']"
"It is common ground that the Commission is required to make a complex economic assessment when it examines whether particular measures can be described as State aid because the public authorities did not act in the same way as a private creditor (see Case C-525/04 P Spain v Lenzing [2007] ECR I-9947, paragraph 59).",1,"['commission be require ', ' to make assessment', 'it examine ', 'measure can be describe aid', ' see case']"
"In this connection, it must be observed that, in the context of the review conducted by the European Union Courts on complex economic assessments made by the Commission in the field of State aid, it is not for those Courts to substitute their own economic assessment for that of the Commission (see, to that effect, Case C-290/07 P Commission v Scott [2010] ECR I-7763, paragraphs 64 and 66 and the case- law cited).",1,"['it must be observe ', ' ducte courts', ' ducte assessment', ' make commission', ' make field', 'courts to substitute assessment', 'courts to substitute case', 'courts to substitute that', ' see effect']"
"However, the European Union Courts must, inter alia, establish not only whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the relevant information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (Case C-12/03 P Commission v Tetra Laval [2005] ECR I-987, paragraph 39, and Commission v Scott, paragraph 65).",1,"['courts must establish number', 'courts must establish case', 'company tain information', 'which must be take account', ' to assess situation', ' substantiate clusion', ' draw it']"
"It follows from the foregoing that, having regard to the arguments put forward by Frucona Koice at first instance, the General Court had to establish, inter alia, whether the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy was relevant in the present case for the purposes of an assessment from the point of view of the private creditor test and, if so, whether the Commission took account of it.",1,"['it follow forego', ' have regard', ' put koice', ' put instance', 'court have ', ' relate duration', 'commission take account', 'commission take it']"
"In that regard, all information liable to have a significant influence on the decision- making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor, in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor experiencing difficulty in making the payments, must be regarded as being relevant.",1,"[' to have influence', ' seek debtor', ' to recover sum', ' experience difficulty', ' make payment', 'information must be regard ']"
"In the present case, it is common ground that, for the purposes of recovering the sums owed to it, a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office would have had to make the choice, inter alia, between the proposed arrangement and the bankruptcy of Frucona Koice.",1,"[' recover sum', 'creditor would have have ', ' to make choice']"
"It follows that, in order to identify the more advantageous alternative, such a creditor would have had to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of each of those procedures.",1,"['it follow ', ' to identify alternative', 'creditor would have have ', ' to weigh advantage']"
"As Frucona Koice correctly argues, however, since the duration of the abovementioned procedures postponed the recovery of the sums due and might thus have affected, in the case of lengthy procedures, inter alia, their value, this is clearly a factor which is liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office.",1,"['company argue ', 'duration postpone recovery', 'duration might have affect value', 'duration might have affect case', ' to have influence', ' to have situation']"
"Consequently, the onus was on the General Court to establish whether the Commission had taken into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the available information relating to, inter alia, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.",1,"['commission have take information', 'commission have take account', 'commission have take assessment', ' relate duration']"
"In this connection, it is apparent from paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, cited in paragraph 35 above, that the General Court found that the Commission had indicated, in recital 54 of the contested decision, the position of the Slovak Republic as regards the duration of such a procedure, and that it referred, in recital 40 of that decision, to that of Frucona Koice.",1,"[' cite paragraph', 'court find ', 'commission have indicate position', 'commission have indicate recital', ' regard duration', 'it refer recital', 'it refer that']"
From this it concluded that the Commission had not 'ignored that question'.,1,"['company clude ', 'commission have ignore question']"
"However, first, the recitals to which the General Court referred are included, as Frucona Koice has correctly pointed out, in Titles IV and V of the contested decision, which summarise the observations of the interested parties and of the Slovak Republic, and not in Title VI, which contains the Commission's assessment.",1,"['court refer ', 'recital be include title', 'koice have point ', 'which summarise observation', 'recital number title', 'company tain assessment']"
"Next, as has been observed in paragraph 82 of this judgment, the onus was on the General Court to establish, not whether the Commission had or had not ignored the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, but whether it had taken that information into account in its assessment of the private creditor test.",1,"[' have be observe paragraph', ' to establish number', 'commission have ', ' have ignore information', ' relate duration', 'it have take information', 'it have take account', 'it have take assessment']"

"Lastly, in so far as the General Court examined, in paragraphs 125 to 127 of the judgment under appeal, also cited in paragraph 35 above, various factors relating to the reliability and the consistency of the information produced by Frucona Koice during the administrative procedure and in so far as it held that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the Commission was able to find that the duration of a bankruptcy procedure was not liable to influence the decision-making process of a private creditor, it must be observed that the General Court's examination is not connected with any assessment featuring in the contested decision.",1,"['court examine ', ' cite paragraph', ' relate reliability', ' produce koice', ' produce procedure', 'it hold ', ' to influence process', 'it must be observe ', ' feature decision']"
"It follows that, in order to reject the pleas which it was examining, the General Court relied on an assessment of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure that serves to fill a gap in the reasoning for the contested decision by means of grounds which did not form part of that decision.",1,"['it follow ', ' to reject plea', 'it be examine ', 'court rely assessment', 'that serve ', ' to fill gap', ' to fill mean', 'which do form part']"

"Article 264 TFEU provides that, if the action is well founded, the act concerned must be declared void.",1,"['tfeu provide ', 'action be found ', 'company must be declare void']"

"It follows from the foregoing that, in having failed to establish whether the Commission had taken into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, and in having filled, in that regard, by means of its own reasoning, a gap in the reasoning in the contested decision, the General Court erred in law.",1,"['it follow forego', 'commission have take duration', 'commission have take account', 'commission have take assessment', ' having fill gap', ' having fill regard', ' having fill mean', 'court err law']"

"A private creditor, however, it argues, would have taken that duration into account and would therefore have preferred to accept the proposed arrangement, given that the bankruptcy procedure would take much longer than that of the arrangement, would thus involve a loss in respect of credit interest as against the proceeds of the arrangement and would thus not ensure the recovery of a sum greater than that offered under the proposed arrangement.",0,"['it argue ', 'creditor would have take duration', 'creditor would have take account', 'creditor would have prefer ', ' to accept arrangement', 'procedure would take ', 'procedure would involve loss', ' would ensure recovery', ' offer arrangement']"

"First of all, even if that bankruptcy procedure would have lasted a long time, which the Commission disputes, having regard to, inter alia, the opinion of the Slovak authorities and the small number of creditors, it follows from the findings made in the contested decision that the arrangement would in any event have been less advantageous for the Slovak State than the bankruptcy procedure.",0,"['procedure would have last regard', 'commission dispute ', ' have regard', 'it follow finding', ' make decision']"
"Next, as the local Tax Office enjoyed the status of preferential creditor, since its debt was guaranteed by Frucona Koice's immovable assets, evaluated by the latter at SKK 194 million and by that office at SKK 397 million, its claims could have been satisfied at any time during the bankruptcy procedure by the sale of the assets constituting the guarantee, in accordance with Law No 328/1991 on bankruptcy and arrangement with creditors.",0,"['office enjoy status', 'debt be guarantee asset', ' evaluate latter', 'ld have be satisfy time', 'ld have be satisfy sale', 'ld have be satisfy accordance', ' stitute guarantee']"

"In so far as the Commission submits that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, it was entitled to find that the duration of a bankruptcy procedure was not liable to influence the decision-making process of a private creditor, it must be noted that, having regard to the arguments and to the evidence produced by Frucona Koice during the administrative procedure and to the matters pointed out in paragraphs 78 to 81 above, the Commission was required to set out in the contested decision, at least in summary form, the considerations which led it to that conclusion.",1,"['commission submit ', 'it be entitle ', ' to influence process', ' have regard', ' produce koice', ' produce procedure', ' point paragraph', 'commission be require ', ' to set sideration', ' to set decision', ' to set form', 'which lead it', 'which lead clusion']"

"As the General Court noted in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, it is, by reason of that finding, necessary to examine the other pleas in law raised by Frucona Koice on which it did not rule, including, in particular, those concerning the assessment of the private creditor test so far as that tax execution procedure is concerned.",1,"[' to examine plea', ' raise koice', 'it do rule ', ' include company', ' cerne assessment']"
