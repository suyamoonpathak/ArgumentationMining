"The appeal First ground of appeal, relating to the concept of State aid, the obligation to state reasons and distortion of evidence Arguments of the parties By the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court infringed Article 107(1) TFEU by distorting the facts and describing them incorrectly, when it held that the compulsory insurance contributions paid in 2008 and 2009 by farmers who received compensation aid paid by ELGA in those years constituted State resources.",0,"[' relate cept', ' relate argument', 'company plain ', 'court infringe tfeu', ' distort fact', ' describe they', 'it hold ', ' pay 2008', ' pay farmer', 'who receive aid', ' pay elga', ' pay year', 'tribution stitute resource', 'company stitute resource']"
"First, the Hellenic Republic submits that the General Court relied on the judgment in Freskot (C-355/00, EU:C:2003:298) in concluding that that aid constituted State aid; yet, in paragraph 87 of that judgment, the Court held, on the contrary, that it was not — in the case that gave rise to that judgment — sufficiently apprised of the relevant points of fact and law needed in order to rule on the classification of the benefits granted by ELGA as State aid.",0,"['republic submit ', 'court rely judgment', 'court rely cluding', 'company stitute aid', 'court hold trary', 'that give rise', 'that give judgment', ' apprise point', ' to rule classification', ' grant elga']"
"Secondly, the General Court was wrong in finding that the contributions paid by farmers were not ‘private resources’ because they were accounted for as State revenue under Article 5a of Law 1790/1988.",0,"[' pay farmer', 'they be account revenue', 'they be account article']"
The Hellenic Republic observes that it is clear from that provision that the special insurance contribution for ELGA was collected by the State or by banks before being paid to ELGA.,0,"['republic observe ', 'tribution be lecte state']"
The fact that the legislature lays down detailed rules under which the special insurance contribution collected by the State is to be paid to ELGA does not make that contribution a State resource.,0,"['legislature lay rule', ' lecte state', 'fact do make ']"
"If such an interpretation were accepted, the classification of that contribution as a private resource or a public resource would turn on its method of collection, and it would therefore be necessary to distinguish the contributions collected by the State from those collected through banks and paid to ELGA.",0,"['interpretation be accept ', 'classification would turn method', ' to distinguish company', ' to distinguish company', ' lecte state', ' lecte bank', ' pay elga']"
"Moreover, if the State collected the funds in question without being required to pay them out in full, it would not have provided, in Article 5a(16) of Law 1790/1988, for the levying of a commission.",0,"['company lecte fund', ' to pay they', 'it would have provide article', 'it would have provide levying']"
"Consequently, the State or the banks are merely intermediaries with regard to, or remunerated collectors of, the special insurance contribution.",0,[]
"It constitutes ELGA revenue exclusively and is not subject to public control, but is merely collected by banking institutions and by the State in order to be paid to ELGA without ever having been available to the competent authority.",0,"['it stitute revenue', 'it be lecte institution', ' to be pay elga']"
"By the second part of the first ground of appeal, the Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons by not responding to the argument that the special insurance contributions ought to have been deducted from the amount of State aid to be recovered ECLI:EU:C:2016:145 JUDGMENT OF 8.",0,"['company plain ', 'court infringe obligation', 'court infringe number', ' respond argument', ' to have be deduct amount']"
"6 — CASE C-431/14 P GREECE v COMMISSION because, in the light of the fact that they were paid in 2008 and 2009 by farmers who were beneficiaries of the alleged aid, they did not satisfy the condition relating to the existence of an economic advantage.",0,"['they be pay 2008', 'they be pay farmer', 'they do satisfy dition', ' relate existence']"
"In the alternative, the Hellenic Republic submits that the General Court applied that condition incorrectly to the facts of the present case, since, because of the existence of those contributions, the payment of compensation aid had only a limited effect on competition, if indeed any impact at all.",0,"['republic submit ', 'court apply dition', 'court apply fact', 'payment have effect']"
"In its assessment, the General Court even upheld an interpretation of the decision at issue that is contrary to the principle prohibiting reformatio in peius.",0,"['court uphold interpretation', ' prohibit reformatio', ' prohibit peius']"
The Commission disputes the admissibility of the argument alleging distortion of the facts as well as the merits of both parts of the present ground of appeal.,0,"['commission dispute admissibility', ' allege distortion']"
"Findings of the Court With regard to the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be recalled, in the first place, as regards the argument that the General Court distorted the facts, that it follows from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to find the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents in the file submitted to it, and, second, to assess those facts (judgments in General Motors v Commission, C-551/03 P, EU:C:2006:229, paragraph 51, and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta v Commission, C-352/09 P, EU:C:2011:191, paragraph 179).",1,"['it should be recall place', ' regard argument', 'court distort fact', 'it follow subparagraph', 'court have jurisdiction', ' to find fact', ' submit it', 'court to assess judgment']"
"Therefore, the appraisal of the facts by the General Court does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the evidence produced before it is distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (judgments in Archer Daniels Midland and Archer Daniels Midland Ingredients v Commission, C-397/03 P, EU:C:2006:328, paragraph 85, and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta v Commission, C-352/09 P, EU:C:2011:191, paragraph 180).",1,"[' produce it', 'sense be distort ']"
"Where an appellant alleges distortion of the evidence by the General Court, he must, under Article 256 TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to such distortion.",1,"['appellant allege distortion', 'he must indicate evidence', ' to have be distort court', 'he show error', 'which lead distortion']"
"In addition, it is settled case-law of the Court that distortion must be obvious from the documents in the Court’s file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (judgments in Lafarge v Commission, C-413/08 P, EU:C:2010:346, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, C-47/10 P, EU:C:2011:698, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).",1,"['it be settle law', ' to carry assessment', ' to carry lafarge']"
"In the present case, the General Court found as follows in paragraphs 122 to 128 and 130 to 132 of the judgment under appeal: ‘122 The Commission recalled in the contested decision, that the Court had already held in the judgment in Freskot [(C-355/00, EU:C:2003:298)] that “the national legislation at issue clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law (see, in particular, France v Commission, [C-482/99, EU:C:2002:294], paragraph 24)” (recital 58).",1,"['court find paragraph', 'commission recall decision', 'court have hold judgment', 'court have hold freskot', 'legislation establish ', ' provide elga', 'benefit be grant resource']"
"The Commission found that: “... under Article 5(a) of Law … 1790/1988 ... and other provisions of Greek legislation in force, ELGA’s income from the special contribution was collected by the tax authorities, entered in the State budget as State revenue and paid to ELGA from the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture (now the Ministry of Rural Development and Food).",1,"['commission find ', 'income be lecte authority', 'income enter budget', 'income enter revenue', ' pay budget']"
"Consequently, the fact that the contributions in question are entered into the accounts as State revenue is sufficient to consider that the payments made by ELGA were financed by State resources” (recital 58).",1,"['tribution be enter account', 'tribution be enter revenue', ' make elga', 'payment be finance recital']"
"Those findings, which are not disputed by the Hellenic Republic, suffice to conclude that the compensation payments that correspond to the contributions by farmers are State resources and are imputable to the State.",1,"[' dispute republic', 'finding suffice clude', 'company respond tribution']"
"Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the part of the payments corresponding to the contributions by farmers may not be regarded as being private funds.",1,"['republic claim ', ' respond tribution', 'part may be regard ', 'number may be regard ']"
"Accordingly, the fact that a part of the payments made in 2008 was financed by contributions by farmers does not preclude these being State aid financed by resources imputable to the State.",1,"[' make 2008', 'part be finance tribution', 'fact do preclude ', ' finance resource']"
"Moreover, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the classification as State aid does not apply to the contributions paid by farmers but to the payments made in 2008.",1,"['republic claim ', 'classification do apply tribution', ' pay farmer', ' make 2008']"
"In that regard, it must be recalled that it has been held in the context of the first and second pleas in law that neither the compensatory nature of the measures, nor the fact that they are justified by a social objective, precludes the payments made by ELGA being classified as an advantage.",1,"['it must be recall ', 'it have be hold text', 'they be justify objective', ' make elga', 'payment be classify advantage']"
"Furthermore, the Hellenic Republic concedes that the contributions paid by farmers are not proportionate to risk and that it is possible that certain farmers pay a contribution without receiving compensation payments from ELGA.",1,"['company cede ', ' pay farmer', 'farmer pay tribution', ' receive payment', ' receive elga']"
The payments made in 2008 were therefore independent of the contributions paid by the farmers and constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions.,1,"[' make 2008', ' pay farmer', 'payment stitute advantage', ' undertake number', 'beneficiary have obtain dition']"
"It follows from the foregoing that the Commission was fully entitled to find that the payments made by ELGA in 2008 were advantages financed by State resources, even if they were financed in part by contributions by farmers.",1,"['it follow forego', 'commission be entitle ', ' make elga', ' make 2008', ' finance resource', 'they be finance tribution', 'they be finance farmer']"
The Hellenic Republic has not shown that the Commission erred in classifying those payments as State aid.,1,"['republic have show ', 'commission err ', ' classify payment', ' classify aid']"
"... 130 The contested decision states that the compensation payments made by ELGA in 2009, of EUR 415 019 452 in total, were made on the basis of the Inter-ministerial decree.",1,"['decision state ', ' make elga', ' make 2009', 'payment be make basis']"
"The Inter-ministerial decree provided for compensation of EUR 425 million, on an exceptional basis, for damage in 2008 and stated that, for the purpose of paying that compensation, ELGA would take out a loan, guaranteed by the State, with a bank, for the total amount ... 131 It follows that the Commission was correct in finding that the compensation payments made in 2009 were not financed by the contributions paid under the ELGA compulsory insurance scheme ... .",1,"['decree provide pensation', 'decree provide basis', 'decree provide damage', 'decree provide 2008', 'decree state ', ' pay pensation', 'elga would take loan', 'elga would take amount', ' guarantee state', 'it follow ', ' make 2009', 'payment be finance tribution', ' pay scheme']"
"Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the contributions paid by farmers in 2009 under the compulsory insurance scheme may not be regarded as financing part of the aid paid in 2009.’ In the light of the General Court’s findings set out above, the argument alleging distortion of the facts must be rejected at the outset, since, by its line of argument, the Hellenic Republic has not shown that the General Court distorted the facts in a manner obvious from the documents in the file.",1,"['republic claim ', ' pay farmer', ' pay 2009', ' pay scheme', 'tribution may be regard part', 'number may be regard part', ' pay 2009', ' allege distortion', 'argument must be reject outset', 'republic have show ', 'court distort fact', 'court distort manner']"
"In the second place, with regard to the argument that the General Court described the facts incorrectly, it should be stated that, having first of all pointed out, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the classification as State aid did not apply to the special insurance contribution paid by farmers but to the payment of compensation aid by ELGA; having then found, in paragraph 127 of that judgment, that the payments made in 2008 were independent of those contributions; and, lastly, having pointed out, in paragraphs 130 to 132 of that judgment, that the payments made in 2009 were financed not by the contributions but by means of a loan, guaranteed by the State, taken out to that end with a bank, the General Court was entitled to conclude, without erring in law, that those payments were advantages financed by State resources.",1,"['court describe fact', 'it should be state ', ' having point paragraph', 'classification apply tribution', ' pay farmer', ' having find paragraph', ' make 2008', ' having point paragraph', ' make 2009', 'payment be finance tribution', 'payment be finance mean', ' guarantee state', ' take end', ' take bank', 'court be entitle ', ' err law', ' finance resource']"
"Nor did the General Court err in law, in the third place, in relying, in paragraph 122 of the judgment under appeal, on paragraph 81 of the judgment in Freskot (C-355/00, EU:C:2003:298), since the Court held in that paragraph, with regard to a previous version of Article 5a of Law 1790/1988 but a version in essence identical to that applicable to the present dispute, that that legislation ‘clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law’.",1,"['court do err law', 'court do err place', ' rely paragraph', ' rely paragraph', 'court hold paragraph', 'court hold regard', 'legislation establish ', ' provide elga', 'benefit be grant resource']"

"As regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, it must be recalled that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the duty incumbent upon the General Court under Article 36 and the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.",1,"[' regard part', 'it must be recall ', ' accord law', ' to state reason', 'duty do require court', ' to provide account', 'that follow ', ' articulate party']"

"In the context of that examination, the General Court stated, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, ‘that the fact that the payments made by ELGA in 2009 were intended to compensate for damage caused to agricultural production because of adverse weather conditions d[id] not preclude the existence of an advantage and the classification as State aid’ and, in paragraph 102 of that judgment, ‘that, according to settled case-law, competition is distorted where a measure mitigates the burden imposed on a beneficiary undertaking and thereby strengthens its position as regards competing undertakings’.",1,"['court state paragraph', 'court state paragraph', ' make elga', ' make 2009', 'payment be intend ', ' to pensate damage', ' cause production', ' cause dition', 'fact preclude existence', ' accord law', 'petition be distort ', 'measure mitigate burden', ' impose undertaking', 'measure strengthen position', ' regard undertaking']"
"In those circumstances, it must be held that the statement of reasons in the judgment under appeal meets the requirements referred to in paragraph 38 of this judgment.",1,"['it must be hold ', 'statement meet requirement', ' refer paragraph']"
"Moreover, having found that the payments of compensation aid made in 2008 and 2009 were independent of the contributions paid by the farmers, the General Court was entitled to conclude, without erring in law, that those payments constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions, and therefore affected competition.",1,"[' make 2008', ' pay farmer', 'court be entitle clude', ' err law', 'company stitute advantage', ' undertake number', 'beneficiary have obtain dition', 'company affect petition']"

"Second ground of appeal, relating to the concept of State aid and the obligation to state reasons Arguments of the parties The Hellenic Republic complains that the General Court rejected its first and second pleas in law in the action by relying on the settled case-law of the Court that measures which, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings or which are to be regarded as an economic advantage which the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions are to be regarded as State aid (judgment in Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg, C-280/00, EU:C:2003:415, paragraph 84 and the case-law cited).",0,"[' relate cept', ' relate obligation', 'ground plain ', 'court reject plea', ' rely law', 'that measure ', ' to favour undertaking', ' to be regard advantage', 'undertaking would have obtain dition', ' to be regard judgment']"
