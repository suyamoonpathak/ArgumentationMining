"It points out that the former was not open to Community competition until Regulation No 4059/89 entered into force on 1 July Consequently, aid granted before that date to carriers operating exclusively at local, regional or national level could not affect intra-Community trade and therefore did not constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",0,"['it point ', 'number enter force', 'number enter july', ' grant date', ' operate number', 'aid affect trade', 'aid affect aid', 'aid affect purpose']"
"However, aid granted to those carriers after that date is State aid for the purposes of that provision, since it was capable of affecting trade between Member States.",0,"[' grant date', ' affect trade']"
"With regard to the international road haulage market, the Commission states, in section III, fourth paragraph, of the reasons for the contested decision, that it has been open to intra-Community competition since 1969, when Regulation No 1018/68 entered into force.",0,"['commission state section', 'number enter force']"
"It infers from this, in section VII, last paragraph, of those reasons, that the aid provided for by Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 had strengthened the financial position and hence the scope of commercial haulage companies in the Region vis-Ã -vis their competitors since 1969 for companies engaged in international transport and was accordingly capable of affecting trade between Member States.",0,"['it infer this', ' provide law', 'aid have strengthen position', 'aid have strengthen 1969', 'aid have strengthen panie', ' engage transport', ' affect trade']"

"Next, in examining, in section VIII, ninth paragraph, of the contested decision, whether the aid thus characterised as State aid qualifies for a derogation, the Commission considers that the aid granted under Article 6 of Law No 4/1985 for financing equipment designed for combined transport can benefit from the exemption provided for in Article 3(1)(e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70.",0,"[' examine section', ' characterise aid', 'aid qualify derogation', 'company sider ', ' grant article', ' finance equipment', ' design transport', 'aid can benefit exemption', ' provide article']"

"I-4130 ITALY v COMMISSION 8 Finally, section VIII, last paragraph, of the reasons for the contested decision states that aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 to commercial road haulage companies in the Region engaged in local, regional or national transport operations from 1 July 1990 onwards, as well as to those engaged in international transport operations, is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty.",0,"['section state ', ' grant law', ' grant panie', ' engage operation', ' engage operation']"
"The Commission therefore concludes, in section IX of those reasons, that, since the Italian Government implemented the aid scheme in question without having fulfilled the obligation to notify it, the scheme should be regarded as illegal and recovery of the aid in question should be regarded as necessary in order to restore the fair conditions of competition which existed before that aid was granted.",0,"['commission clude section', 'government implement scheme', ' having fulfil obligation', 'scheme should be regard ', 'recovery should be regard ', ' to restore dition', 'which exist ', 'aid be grant ']"

"The grounds on which the Court of First Instance based its reasoning are the following: '142 According to established case-law, existing aid is aid introduced before the Treaty came into force or before the accession of the Member State concerned to the European Communities and aid which has been properly put into effect under the conditions laid down in Article 93(3) of the Treaty ([Case C-387/92] Banco Exterior de EspaÃ±a [[1994] ECR I-877], paragraph 19, and Case C-295/97 Piaggio [1999] ECR I-3735, paragraph 48).",0,"['court base reasoning', ' accord law', ' come force', ' cerne communities', 'which have be put effect', 'which have be put dition', ' lay article']"
"Likewise, a system of aid established in a market that was initially closed to competition must, when that market is liberalised, be regarded as an existing aid system, since at the time of its establishment it did not come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, which, having regard to the requirements set out in that provision regarding effect on trade between Member States and repercussions on competition, applies only to sectors open to competition.",0,"[' establish market', 'that be close petition', 'market be liberalise ', 'system must be regard system', 'it do number e', 'it do number scope', ' have regard', ' set provision', ' regard effect', 'which apply sector']"
"In the present case, as the international road haulage sector had been opened up to competition by Regulation No 1018/68 with effect from 1969, the systems of aid in question, established in 1981 and 1985, came within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty from the time of their introduction and should therefore be regarded as new systems of aid which should thus have been notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",0,"['sector have be open petition', 'sector have be open number', ' establish 1981', 'system come scope', 'system come time', 'system should be regard system', ' ifie commission']"
"I-4136 ITALY v COMMISSION 146 On the other hand, as the cabotage market was liberalised by Regulation No 4059/89 only from 1 July 1990, the systems of aid in question did not, at the time of their introduction in 1981 and 1985, come within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, as regards aid granted in the local, regional or national transport sector.",0,"['market be liberalise number', 'market be liberalise july', 'system do number e', 'system do number time', 'system do number scope', ' regard aid', ' grant sector']"

"Pursuant to Article 93(1) and (2) of the Treaty and in accordance with the principle of legal certainty, the Commission is, as part of its constant review of existing aid, only empowered to require the elimination or modification of such aid within a period which it is to determine.",0,"['commission be empower ', ' to require elimination', ' to require period']"
"That aid can, therefore, lawfully be implemented as long as the Commission has not found it to be incompatible with the common market (Case C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1992] ECR I-4145, paragraphs 23 and 25, and Banco Exterior de Esparta, cited above, paragraph 20).",0,"['aid can be implement ', 'commission have find ']"

"4 - CASE C-298/00 P 21 The fourth plea for annulment put forward by the applicants was based on the fact that Article 4, to which Article 5 of the contested decision refers in providing for the recovery of aid incompatible with the Treaty, unequivocally finds that the aid disbursed from 1 July 1990, a date which applies not only to aid granted to undertakings engaged exclusively in local, regional or national transport, but also to aid granted to those engaged in international road haulage, was incompatible with the common market.",0,"[' put applicant', 'plea be base fact', 'article refer ', ' provide recovery', 'article find ', ' disburse july', 'which apply number', 'which apply aid', ' engage transport', ' engage haulage']"

"The Court of First Instance also rejected that plea in law, on the grounds set out in paragraphs 162 to 177 of the contested judgment, which are based on the consideration that Article 4 of the contested decision must be interpreted as covering the aid granted to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport from 1 July 1990 onwards and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid systems in question.",0,"['court reject plea', 'court reject law', 'court reject ground', ' set paragraph', 'which be base sideration', 'article must be interpret ', ' ere aid', ' engage transport', ' engage july', ' engage haulage', ' engage introduction']"
"The Court of First Instance also held that, since the aid in question had not been notified to the Commission, the applicants had not established the existence of any specific factor which would give grounds for assuming that the obligation to reimburse individual aid granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage was, in view of the effect of such aid on competition, manifestly disproportionate to the objectives of the Treaty or any exceptional circumstance of such a kind as to create legitimate expectations as to the lawfulness of such aid paid to undertakings engaged in international road haulage.",0,"['court hold ', ' ifie commission', 'applicant have establish existence', 'which would give ground', ' to reimburse aid', ' engage haulage', ' to create expectation', ' pay undertaking', ' engage haulage']"

"More specifically, that decision did not infringe any of those applicants' specific rights which were different from those of other undertakings in receipt of that aid.",0,['decision do infringe any']
"In the Commission's view, that analysis is confirmed by the case-law (see, inter alia, Case 282/85 DEFI v Commission [1986] ECR 2469 and Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219) and is not invalidated by the judgment in Joined Cases C-15/98 and C-105/99 Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission [2000] ECR I-8855).",0,"['analysis be firm see', ' see commission', ' invalidate judgment']"

"Finally, if all the undertakings which received aid granted under schemes declared illegal and incompatible with the common market and recovery of which was ordered by a Commission decision I - 4142 ITALY v COMMISSION were allowed to bring actions contesting that decision before the Court of First Instance, in cases where those undertakings did not bring actions, any reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the recovery of such aid would be declared inadmissible (see Case C-188/92 TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf [1994] ECR I-833, paragraphs 25 and 26).",0,"['which receive aid', ' grant scheme', ' declare illegal', 'recovery be order decision', 'undertaking be allow case', ' to bring action', ' to bring company', ' to bring court', ' test decision', 'undertaking do bring action', ' cerne recovery', 'reference would be declare inadmissible', ' see case']"
"The Commission is of the opinion that the perverse effect of such a situation would be to oblige recipient undertakings to contest the decision before the Court of First Instance within the limited period laid down for bringing an action for annulment, even before knowing whether, under national law, they will actually be required to repay the aid received, such an effect potentially weakening the judicial protection of those undertakings.",0,"[' to oblige undertaking', ' to test decision', ' to test court', ' to test period', ' bring action', 'they will be require ', ' to repay aid', 'effect weaken protection']"
The Commission is of the view that this plea of inadmissibility constitutes a ground involving a question of public policy.,0,"['plea stitute ground', ' involve question']"

"It must be recalled that Article 173 of the Treaty, by virtue of which the Court of Justice is to review the legality of Community acts, provides that any natural or legal person may on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of this Treaty or of any rule of law relating to its application, or misuse of powers institute proceedings against a decision addressed to that person or against a decision which, although in the form of a regulation or a decision addressed to another person, is of direct and individual concern to the former.",1,"['it must be recall ', ' to review legality', 'article provide ', ' relate application', 'person may institute proceeding', 'person may institute decision', ' address person', ' address person']"
"Where a decision is not of individual concern to a natural or legal person within the meaning of that provision, which is an essential condition for having locus standi in proceedings seeking judicial review of a Community act, such proceedings are inadmissible and that inadmissibility therefore constitutes a ground involving a question of public policy which may, and even must, be raised of its own motion by the Community judicature (see, with regard to a party having no interest in bringing or in maintaining an appeal, Case C-19/93 P Rendo and Others v Commission [1995] ECR I-3319, paragraph 13).",1,"[' have standi', ' have proceeding', ' seek review', 'inadmissibility stitute ground', 'inadmissibility stitute case', ' involve question', 'which must be raise motion', 'party have interest', ' maintain appeal']"

"Such a decision is, vis-Ã -vis the undertaking should it seek to contest the decision, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of I - 4144 ITALY v COMMISSION persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (Van der Kooy and Others v Commission, cited above, paragraph 15; Case C-6/92 Federmineraria and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I-6357, paragraph 14, and Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission, paragraph 33).",1,"['it should seek ', ' to test decision', 'which be determine ', 'which entail effect', ' envisage manner']"

"In that regard, in paragraphs 164 and 166 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance concluded, firstly, that, in the light of the reasons for the contested decision, and in particular section VIII, last paragraph, of those reasons, Article 4 of that decision must be interpreted as meaning that the aid granted under Laws Nos 28/1981 and 4/1985 with effect from 1 July 1990 to undertakings engaged in local, regional or national transport and that granted to undertakings engaged in international road haulage since the introduction of the aid in dispute are incompatible with the common market.",1,"['company clude ', 'article must be interpret ', ' grant law', ' grant effect', ' engage transport', 'that grant ', ' engage haulage', ' engage introduction']"
"Secondly, in paragraph 165 of the contested judgment, the Court of First Instance held that that interpretation is clear from a reading of the operative part of the contested decision taken as a whole.",1,"['court hold ', ' take whole']"
Such an analysis does not reflect an error of assessment on the part of the Court of First Instance.,1,['analysis do reflect error']
"I - 4164 ITALY v COMMISSION 100 It follows that the third part of the second plea in law, relating to the extent of the obligation to recover the aid in dispute, must be rejected.",2,"['i follow ', 'it follow ', ' relate extent', ' to recover aid', 'part must be reject ']"
"In the light of the foregoing considerations, the second plea in law in support of the appeal must be rejected in its entirety.",0,['plea must be reject entirety']
"Since none of the pleas in law put forward by the Italian Republic in support of its appeal can be upheld, the appeal must be dismissed.",0,"[' put republic', ' put support', 'e can be uphold ', 'appeal must be dismiss ']"
"Costs 103 Under Article 69(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which applies to the appeal procedure by virtue of Article 118 of those Rules, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings.",0,"['which apply procedure', 'which apply virtue', ' to pay t', 'they have be apply pleading']"
"However, under the first subparagraph of Article 69(3) of those Rules, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, the Court may order that the parties bear their own costs.",0,"['party succeed some', 'party fail head', 'court may order ', 'party bear t']"
"Since the Italian Republic and Collorigh and Others have failed in their pleas in the main appeal and the Commission has failed in its pleas in the cross-appeal, they must each be ordered to bear their own costs.",0,"['republic have fail plea', 'commission have fail plea', 'they must be order ', ' to bear t']"
