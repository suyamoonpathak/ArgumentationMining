It was noti fied to the French Republic on 3 August 2004.,0,"['i fie republic', 'i fie august']"

"Accordingly, the exemption from busi ness tax during that period did not constitute State aid (recitals 22 to 33 and 53 [of the contested decision]).",0,"['exemption do number stitute', 'exemption do number recital', 'exemption do number decision']"
"On the other hand, the Commission found that the special tax regime applicable from 1994 to 2002 introduced State aid consisting in the difference between the tax which FT should have paid under the general law and the amount of business tax actually paid (“the tax differential”).",0,"['commission find ', 'regime introduce company', ' siste difference', 'ft should have pay law', ' pay differential']"

It therefore had to be recovered (recitals 34 to 53 of the contested decision).,0,"['it have ', ' to be recover decision']"
I  -  12949 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION The Commission gave the following reasons for categorising the special tax regime as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.,0,"['i give reason', 'commission give reason', ' categorise regime', ' categorise aid']"
"First, the Commission set out the reasons why it considered it appropriate to discount the argument of the French authorities to the effect that the advantage found during the period from 1994 to 2002 was more than offset by the fixed levy which FT had had to pay during the period from 1991 to 1993 (recitals 35 to 41 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission set reason', ' to discount argument', ' find period', 'advantage be offset levy', 'ft have have ', ' to pay period']"
"First of all, the Commission states that Law No 90-568 had established two suc cessive and distinct tax regimes: (i) an exemption regime, applicable from 1991 to 1993, under which a fixed levy replaced the general law taxes, including busi ness tax, and (ii) a special regime introduced by way of derogation, as a result of which business tax was underpaid and which initially applied from 1994 and which was terminated with effect from the 2003 tax assessments (recitals 36 and 38 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission state ', 'number have establish regime', 'levy replace taxis', ' include tax', ' introduce way', ' introduce result', 'tax be underpay ', 'which apply 1994', 'which be terminate effect', 'which be terminate recital']"
"… Consequently, the Commission found that it could not agree that the tax differen tial from which FT had benefited between 1994 and 2002 had been offset by the fixed levy paid between 1991 and 1993, which was not connected with business tax either specifically by Law No 90-568 or by the method by which it was calcu lated (recital 38 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission find ', 'number agree ', 'ft have benefit 1994', 'tial have be offset levy', ' pay 1991', ' necte tax']"
"Moreover, the Commission found that payment of the fixed levy at issue was more akin to paying a share of the earnings to the owner of the capital than to taxation.",0,"['commission find ', ' pay share']"
"In those circumstances, it was only by way of exception that the Commission had been able to accept that the levy offset the total exemption from business tax from which FT had benefited from 1991 to 1993.",0,"['levy offset exemption', 'ft have benefit 1991']"
"A normal application of the law could, on the contrary, have led to the conclusion that that exemption constituted State I  -  12950 JUDGMENT OF 8.",0,"['application have lead clusion', 'company stitute judgment']"

"Lastly, the Commission found that the argument that the payments made by FT to the State between 1991 and 1993 should be set off against the under-taxation of FT from 1994 would involve categorising the surplus tax paid by FT (as com pared with the tax payable under the general law) between 1991 and 1993 as a tax credit, which was not the aim of Law No 90-568.",0,"['commission find ', ' make ft', ' make state', ' make 1991', 'payment should be set taxation', 'payment should be set 1994', 'argument would involve ', ' categorise tax', ' categorise company', ' categorise 1991', ' categorise credit', ' pay ft', ' pare tax']"
"Nor, according to the Commis sion, does that a posteriori theoretical justification reflect the normal application of French tax law: rather, it is designed solely to prevent recovery of the State aid granted to FT (recital 40 of the contested decision).",0,"[' accord sion', 'justification do reflect application', 'it be design ', ' to prevent recovery']"
"Secondly, the Commission found that the tax differential represented an advan tage for FT, granted from resources which should have been incorporated into the budget of the State and accordingly constituted State aid (recital 42 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission find ', 'differential represent tage', ' grant resource', 'which should have be incorporate budget', 'differential stitute recital']"
"Thirdly, in recitals 43 and 44 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that, in order to determine the net advantage from which FT had benefited, it could not take into consideration, at the stage of the decision establishing the existence of State aid, the French Republic’s argument that the corporation tax factor should be corrected downwards because of the higher amounts paid by way of business tax … I  -  12951 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION Fourthly, the Commission – rejecting the arguments submitted by the French Republic to the effect that the aid at issue could not be recovered because of the limitation rules laid down in Article 15 of [Council] Regulation [EC] No 659/1999 [of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [88 EC] (OJ 1999 L 83, p.",0,"['commission state ', ' to determine advantage', 'ft have benefit ', 'it take sideration', 'number take sideration', ' establish existence', 'factor should be recte amount', ' pay way', ' pay i', ' reject argument', ' submit republic', 'number be recover rule', ' lay article', ' lay rule']"
")] – found that the aid at issue was new aid, not existing aid (recital 45 [of the contested decision]).",0,[]
"First, the Commission stated that the expiry of the limitation period laid down in Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 did not have the effect of converting new aid into existing aid, but only of preventing the Commission from ordering the recovery of aid granted more than 10 years before the date on which time began to run for the purposes of barring recovery (recitals 46 to 48 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission state ', ' lay article', 'expiry do have effect', 'company verte aid', 'company verte aid', ' prevent commission', ' order recovery', ' order purpose', ' grant date', 'time begin ', ' bar recital', ' bar 48', ' bar decision']"
"Second, the Commission argued that Law No  90-568 had established an aid scheme and that any limitation concerns only the aid granted under that scheme and not the scheme itself.",0,"['commission argue ', 'number have establish scheme', 'company cern aid', ' grant scheme']"
"The point from which time starts to run is therefore the day on which each form of aid was actually granted to FT, that is to say, on the date, each year, on which the business tax was due (recital 49 of the contested decision).",0,"['time start ', 'form be grant ']"
"Third, the Commission added that the limitation period had been interrupted by the request for information sent to the French Republic on 28 June 2001 (recital 50 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission add ', 'period have be interrupt request', ' send june']"
"The Commission therefore concluded that, since the first form of aid identified had been granted in 1994 – that is to say, fewer than 10 years before 28 June 2001 – the aid at issue had to be recovered in its entirety (recital 51 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission clude ', 'form have be grant 1994', 'aid have ', ' to be recover entirety']"
I  -  12952 JUDGMENT OF 8.,0,[]
"1 — CASE C-81/10 P Fifth, the Commission stated that the French authorities had not put forward any focused argument to prove that the aid at issue was compatible with the com mon market and that the Commission could see no legal basis on which it could be declared compatible with the common market (recital 52 [of the contested decision]).",0,"['commission state ', 'authority have put argument', 'company see basis', 'it be declare company', 'company be declare company']"
"Consequently, in recital 53 of the contested decision, the Commission concluded that (i) the business tax regime applicable to FT during the period from 1991 to 1993 did not constitute State aid and (ii) the tax differential from which FT had benefited during the period from 1994 to 2002, as a consequence of the special tax regime, constituted State aid which was incompatible with the common mar ket and which had been unlawfully implemented, and which must therefore be recovered.",0,"['company clude ', 'ft have benefit period', ' stitute aid', 'which have be implement ', 'which must be recover ']"
"However, the exact amount to be recovered could not be determined, owing to the discrepancies in the information submitted by the French authorities dur ing the administrative procedure.",0,"['amount be determine ', ' submit authority', ' e procedure']"

"In recital 54 of the contested decision, the Commission referred to a report presented to the French Parliament by the Directorate-General for Taxes in No vember 2001, according to which “the immediate normalisation of the conditions of taxation of FT in relation to business tax would involve, at an unchanged rate, an over-taxation of almost 198 million euros for the company”.",0,"['commission refer report', ' present parliament', ' present general', ' present vember', ' accord which', 'malisation would involve taxation', 'malisation would involve rate']"
"In addition, the Commission relied on the estimate of 15 May 2003, the results of which are set out in tabular form in recital 54 of the contested decision.",0,"['commission rely estimate', 'result be set form', 'result be set recital']"
"According I  -  12953 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION to the figures produced by the French Republic, the aggregate theoretical taxation of FT under the general law, for the years 1994 to 2002, was EUR 8 362 million.",0,"[' accord i', ' accord figure', ' produce republic']"

"The Commission also pointed out that, by letter of 29 January 2004, the French authorities had informed it of the amount of the tax charged to FT, under the general law, for the year 2003 (EUR 773 million) and confirmed that the estimate of 15 May 2003 was sound (recital 55 of the contested decision).",0,"['commission point ', 'authority have inform it', 'authority have inform amount', ' charge ft', ' charge law', ' charge year', 'company firm ']"
It was not until the meetings held on 16 and 23 June 2003 that the French authorities contested the reliability of those figures (recitals 56 and 57 of the contested decision).,0,"[' hold june', 'company test reliability']"

"1 — CASE C-81/10 P Findings of the Court 15 With regard to the Commission’s claim that the first ground of appeal is inadmissible, it should be noted that that ground, which forms part of the submissions relating to the existence of State aid, was put forward at first instance in the context of the first and second pleas relied on before the General Court.",1,"['which form part', ' relate existence', 'ground be put instance', 'ground be put text', ' rely court']"
"As regards whether that ground is well founded, according to settled case-law, the definition of aid is more general than that of a subsidy.",1,[' accord law']
"It includes not only positive benefits but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (see, Joined Cases C-78/08 to C-80/08 Paint Graphos and Others [2011] ECR I-7611, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).",1,"['it include benefit', 'which mitigate charge', 'which be include budget', 'which have effect']"
"It should also be noted that the concept of advantage that is intrinsic to the clas sification of a measure as State aid is an objective one, irrespective of the motives of the persons responsible for the measure in question.",1,[]
"Accordingly, the nature of the objectives pursued by State measures and their grounds of justification have no bear ing whatsoever on whether such measures are to be classified as State aid.",1,"[' pursue measure', 'nature have ', 'number bear e', ' to be classify aid']"
"It is estab lished case-law that Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between the causes or the objectives of State aid, but defines them in relation to their effects (see Case C-409/00 Spain v Commission [2003] ECR I-1487, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).",1,"['article do distinguish cause', 'article define they', 'article define relation', ' see case']"
"As regards the present case, it should be noted that the tax regime to which FT was subject during the second period under consideration, namely during the years from 1994 to 2002, constituted an exception to the general law regime.",1,"[' regard case', 'regime stitute exception']"
"In particular, that company benefited from specific tax treatment at national level, characterised by the fact that business tax was calculated on the basis of a weighted average rate, as op posed to the various rates applicable in the different local authorities, whereas the rates to which other undertakings were subject were those voted annually by those I  -  12961 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION authorities.",1,"['that benefit treatment', ' characterise fact', 'tax be calculate basis', ' pose rate', ' vote authority']"
"Moreover, FT was subject to a single rate of business tax in its principle place of business, whereas other undertakings were taxed at the different rates voted by the local authorities in the territory within which those undertakings had estab lishments.",1,"['undertaking be tax rate', ' vote authority', ' vote territory', 'undertaking have lishment']"
"A rate of 1.9 % was also applied to FT, as opposed to the rate of 8 % ap­ plicable to other undertakings, in respect of management costs.",1,"['rate be apply ft', 'rate be apply respect', ' oppose rate']"
"As regards the argument relied on in the present appeal that the General Court’s examination of the tax regime at issue should have taken account of a number of vari ables and extraneous factors, it should be noted that, even though, given the particu lar characteristics of that regime, the Commission was not in a position to determine in advance for each tax year the precise level of taxation for that year, it is nevertheless accepted that the regime was capable of resulting and in fact resulted – as is apparent from recital 59 of the contested decision and paragraph 225 of the judgment under appeal – in FT’s liability to business tax being lower than it would have been if the general law business tax regime had been applied.",1,"[' regard argument', ' rely appeal', 'examination should have take account', 'examination should have take number', ' give characteristic', ' to determine level', ' to determine advance', ' to determine year', 'it be accept ', 'regime have be apply ']"
"It should also be noted that, irrespective of the rates of business tax adopted by the local authorities, FT benefited in all circumstances from a reduced rate in respect of management costs.",1,"['it should be e ', ' adopt authority', 'ft benefit circumstance', 'ft benefit rate', 'ft benefit respect']"
"In those circumstances, the General Court was correct to hold, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, that the finding of the existence of aid depended on a number of ‘circumstances unrelated to’ the special tax regime, such as the fact that the business tax was charged annually and the level of the tax rates voted each year by the authorities in the territory in which FT had establishments.",1,"[' be to hold paragraph', 'finding depend number', 'tax be charge ', ' vote authority', ' vote territory', 'ft have establishment']"
I  -  12962 JUDGMENT OF 8.,0,[]
"1 — CASE C-81/10 P 22 Contrary to the French Republic’s and FT’s claims, such circumstances do not in any way preclude the possibility that, even at the time of its adoption, the special tax regime could have been classified as State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.",1,"['circumstance do preclude possibility', 'company have be classify aid', 'company have be classify purpose']"
"Indeed, it is necessary to make a distinction between, on the one hand, the adoption of an aid scheme, namely in the present case the special tax regime, and, on the other, the grant of annual aid to FT on the basis of that regime, the precise total amount of which depended on certain external factors.",1,"[' to make distinction', 'amount depend factor']"
"As the Advocate General stated at point 59 of his Opinion, the present case involves a dual categorisation, in which the existence of an advantage is attributable, first, to a fixed element forming part of the special tax regime applied to FT, as opposed to the general law regime, and, second, to a variable element, which depends on factual cir cumstances, namely the location of premises or land in the various local authorities and the tax rate applicable in those authorities.",1,"['general state point', 'case involve categorisation', ' form part', ' apply ft', ' oppose regime', 'which depend cumstance']"
"On account of its specific features, as described at paragraph 18 above, the special tax regime could have resulted in FT’s liability to tax being less than it would have been had it been subject to business tax under the general law regime.",1,"[' describe paragraph', 'ld have result ']"
"The fact that FT’s liability to professional tax was indeed lower as of 1994 is directly attributable to the specific features of the special tax regime applied to it, even though the exact amount of annual aid received by it under that regime depended on certain factors unrelated to the regime.",1,"[' apply it', ' receive it', ' receive regime', 'amount depend factor']"
"It is also apparent from the structure of the judgment under appeal that paragraph 323 of that judgment, which refers to circumstances unrelated to the special tax regime, concerns only the annual aid granted to FT under the special tax regime.",1,"['which refer circumstance', ' grant regime']"
"In fact, that paragraph forms part of the analysis of the plea relating to the limitation in time of the Commission’s power to recover unlawful aid.",1,"['paragraph form part', ' relate limitation', ' to recover aid']"
"The findings of the General Court in connection with that plea can relate only to aid actually received and, therefore, concern only the aid from which FT benefited under the special tax regime.",1,"['finding can relate aid', 'ft benefit regime']"
"It follows from those considerations that the General Court did not err in law in finding that the special tax regime conferred an advantage on FT for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC, even though the exact amount of aid granted under that regime had to be determined by reference to certain factors unrelated to the regime.",1,"['it follow sideration', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre ft', 'company ferre purpose', ' grant regime', 'amount have ', ' to be determine reference']"
The first ground of appeal is therefore unfounded.,1,[]
"The second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court misconstrued the concept of State aid in that the Commission failed to take account of the overall tax regime applicable to FT during the years from 1991 to 2002 29 The second ground of appeal relied on by FT is subdivided into three parts.",0,"['court misconstrue cept', 'commission fail ', ' to take account', ' to take regime', ' rely ft', 'ground be subdivide part']"

"1 — CASE C-81/10 P The second part of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court erred in law in its misinterpretation of the contested decision and substituted its own grounds — Arguments of the parties 30 FT maintains that the General Court misinterpreted the contested decision by con cluding that the Commission considered that the aid at issue did not consist in the special tax provisions applicable to that company but in the tax differential estab lished each year between the amounts actually paid by the company and the business tax that would have been due under the general law regime, thus substituting its own grounds for those of the decision.",0,"['court err law', 'court err misinterpretation', 'part substitute ground', 'ft maintain ', 'court misinterpret decision', 'company clude ', 'company sidere ', 'aid do number sist', 'aid do number provision', ' lishe amount', ' pay pany', ' substitute ground', ' substitute those']"
"FT also submits that that interpretation is incon sistent with the enacting terms of the contested decision, according to which the aid at issue consists in the business tax scheme applicable to that company during the period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2002.",0,"['ft submit ', ' accord to', 'company sist scheme']"
"The Commission therefore relied not on the fact that the tax differential established with effect from 1994 arose on an annual basis, but on other reasons of a different nature.",0,"['commission rely fact', ' establish effect', ' establish 1994', 'differential arise basis']"
The Commission argues in reply that the General Court’s reading of the contested decision in the judgment under appeal is consistent with the terms of the decision.,0,['commission argue reply']
It states that it was unnecessary to repeat in the enacting terms of the decision that the tax differential constituted an advantage.,0,"['it state ', ' to repeat term', 'company stitute advantage']"
"The aid from which FT benefited, which consisted in the under-taxation of that company as regards business tax between the years 1994 and 2002, was made available as a result of the business tax regime ap­ plicable to the company during that period.",0,"['ft benefit ', 'company siste taxation', 'company siste year', ' regard tax', 'aid be make available', 'aid be make result']"
"At paragraph 201 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the part of the contested decision which found that the aid derived from a tax differential rep resenting the difference between the amount which FT would have had to pay by way of business tax contributions if it had been subject to the tax under the general law and the amount which it was actually charged under the tax regime at issue.",1,"['court examine part', 'which find ', 'aid derive rep', ' resent difference', 'ft would have have ', ' to pay way', 'it be charge regime']"
"The General Court verified that there was a genuine tax differential at paragraphs 219 to 225 of the judgment, without its findings in that regard being called into question by FT.",1,"['court verify paragraph', 'there be differential', 'finding be call question', 'finding be call ft']"
"As regards the purported substitution of grounds on the part of the General Court, it is sufficient to note that the court did not exceed its powers of review in substituting its own assessment for that of the Commission, since the tax differential in question and the fact that the business tax is paid annually, as provided for in the General Tax Code, form an integral part of the reasoning adopted by the Commission in the contested decision.",1,"[' regard substitution', 'company do exceed power', 'rt do exceed power', ' substitute assessment', ' substitute that', 'tax be pay ', ' provide code', 'differential form part', ' adopt commission', ' adopt decision']"
Recital 42 of the contested decision states that ‘the difference between the business tax actually paid by FT and that which should have been due under the ordinary law from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2003 constitutes State aid inasmuch as it represents an advantage for FT granted through resources which would otherwise have been incorporated in the budget of the State’.,1,"['recital state ', ' pay ft', 'difference stitute aid', 'it represent advantage', ' grant resource', 'which would have be incorporate budget']"
Recital 49 of the decision states that the pro fessional tax was payable annually.,1,['recital state ']
"Furthermore, the point is also made that business tax is payable annually at recital 25 of the decision initiating the formal investigation, to which recital 15 of the contested decision refers.",1,"['point be make ', ' initiate investigation', 'recital refer ']"
"Consequently, the General Court’s interpretation to the effect that the aid at issue consisted in the tax differential deriving from the application of the provisions estab lishing a special regime is consistent with the enacting terms of the contested deci sion, which categorises the regime applicable to FT between the years 1994 and 2002 as aid which is incompatible with the common market.",1,"[' siste differential', ' derive application', ' lishe regime', 'which categorise regime', 'which categorise aid']"
"Indeed, it is by virtue of that special regime that FT was not required to pay business tax in the amounts for which it would normally have been liable under the general law tax regime.",1,"['ft be require ', ' to pay tax']"
The second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected.,1,['part must be reject ']
"The first and third parts of the second ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court misconstrued the concept of State aid since it failed to carry out an overall analysis of the tax regime applicable to FT — Arguments of the parties 37 FT submits that the General Court failed to have regard to the obligation to carry out a comprehensive examination of all the provisions under the regime which derogated from the general law.",0,"['court misconstrue cept', 'it fail ', ' to carry analysis', 'part submit ', 'court fail ', ' to have regard', ' to carry examination', 'which derogate law']"
"In order to determine whether there was an advantage, the Gen eral Court should have compared the charges imposed under the derogating regime with the level of taxation that would have been applied to it if the company had been taxed under the general law regime.",0,"['there be advantage', 'court should have pare charge', 'court should have pare level', ' impose regime', 'that would have be apply it', 'company have be tax regime']"

I  -  12967 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION 38 FT is of the view that neither the fact that the tax is paid annually nor the differences between the two tax periods under consideration could justify a partial analysis con fined to the tax regime applicable as of 1994.,0,"['tax be pay ', 'fact justify company', ' fine regime']"
The General Court was therefore incor rect in refusing to take account of the fact that the company was over-taxed as a result of the fixed levy during the period from 1991 to 1993 when compared with the level of taxation it would have had to bear if it had been subject to the general law on business tax during that period.,0,"[' to take account', 'pany be tax result', 'pany be tax period', 'company pare level', 'it would have have ']"
"Even if the General Court were entitled in its analysis to take account of the fact that the business tax is payable annually, it should have recognised that, as regards the initial tax years under the general derogating tax scheme, namely from the years 1991 to 1993, the company was over-taxed.",0,"[' to take account', ' to take fact', 'it should have recognise ', ' regard year', 'pany be tax ']"
"FT is also of the view that the General Court erred in law in relying, at paragraph 207 of the judgment under appeal, on Case C-66/02 Italy v Commission [2005] ECR I-10901.",0,"['court err law', ' rely paragraph', ' rely case']"
"The General Court was incorrect in concluding, in reliance on that judg ment, that FT benefited from a reduction in charges for the period from 1994 to 2002 which could not be offset by a specific charge imposed on that company in respect of the period from 1991 to 1993.",0,"['ft benefit reduction', 'number be offset charge', ' impose pany', ' impose respect']"
"Similarly, the French Republic maintains that the General Court misconstrued the concept of advantage when it adopted a restrictive approach as regards the link that must exist between an exemption and a charge established by the tax regime at issue.",0,"['republic maintain ', 'court misconstrue cept', 'it adopt approach', ' regard link', 'that must exist ', ' establish regime']"
The General Court should have undertaken an overall analysis covering both the derogating scheme established by Law No 90-568 – in particular any advantages con ferred on FT by that scheme – and the charges payable by FT under the general law.,0,"['court should have undertake analysis', ' ere scheme', ' establish number', ' ferre ft', ' ferre scheme']"
The Commission submits that it is not possible to ‘offset’ aid by invoking charges of a different nature that are unconnected with the aid.,0,"['commission submit ', ' to offset aid', ' invoke charge']"
That applies not only to the question of State resources but also that of the advantage conferred.,0,"['that apply number', 'that apply question', 'company ferre ']"
A loss of State resources cannot be saved from categorisation as aid simply because such loss is ‘set off’ against other sums paid to the State in accordance with other obligations.,0,"['loss can be not save categorisation', 'loss be set sum', ' pay accordance']"

"1 — CASE C-81/10 P there is no sufficient connection between the tax scheme applicable between 1991 and 1993 and the scheme in force as of 1994, the ‘offsetting’ supposition underlying FT’s argument is unfounded.",0,"['there be nection', ' underlie argument']"
"— Findings of the Court 42 In the light of the arguments put forward by the parties, it is necessary to consider whether the General Court erred in law in finding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had been correct in refusing in the contested decision to offset the amounts paid by FT by way of fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 against the tax differentials arising from the special tax regime for the period from 1994 to 2002, in order to determine whether that company benefited from State aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.",1,"[' put party', 'court err law', ' find paragraph', ' refuse decision', ' to offset amount', ' to offset order', ' pay ft', ' pay way', ' arise regime', 'pany benefit aid', 'pany benefit purpose']"
"While recognising that, when examining a measure likely to constitute State aid, the Commission is entitled to take account of the specific charges imposed on an advan tage, the General Court nevertheless found, at paragraph 207 of the judgment under appeal, that a measure cannot be saved from categorisation as aid where the aid beneficiary is subject to a specific charge which is different from and unconnected with the aid in question.",1,"[' examine measure', ' to stitute aid', 'commission be entitle ', ' to take account', ' to take charge', ' impose tage', 'court find paragraph', 'measure can be not save categorisation']"
"That affirmation on the part of the General Court is based on a correct interpretation of Article 87(1) EC (see Case 173/73 Italy v Commission [1974] ECR 709, paragraph 34), notwithstanding the fact that it referred incorrectly in that regard to the judgment in Case C-66/02 Italy v Commission.",1,"['affirmation be base interpretation', ' see case', ' withstand fact', 'it refer regard', 'it refer judgment']"
"I  -  12969 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION 44 The General Court therefore did not err in law in finding, at paragraph 208 of the judgment under appeal, that the validity of the French Republic’s and FT’s argument that the over-taxation of FT between 1991 and 1993, attributable to the fixed levy to which it was subject, offset the tax differential from which that company benefited from 1994 to 2002 depends on the analysis of the objective characteristics of the fixed levy applicable between 1991 and 1993 and on whether it may be regarded as a charge which is connected with the advantage enjoyed by FT as a result of its being taxed under the special regime as of 1994.",1,"['court do number', ' find paragraph', 'taxation offset differential', 'company benefit 1994', 'pany benefit 1994', 'validity depend analysis', 'it may be regard charge', 'which be necte advantage', ' enjoy ft', ' enjoy result', 'its be tax regime']"
It should be noted that the levy applicable to FT between 1991 and 1993 was deter mined by different parameters from those applied with effect from 1994 under the special tax regime.,1,"['levy be deter ', ' mine parameter', ' apply effect', ' apply 1994', ' apply regime']"
The two tax regimes were in fact based on different legal models and operating parameters.,1,['regime be base model']
"As is apparent from recital 17 of the contested decision and paragraph 209 of the judgment under appeal, under the tax scheme applicable to FT from 1991 to 1993, it did not have to pay any tax or levy other than the fixed levy.",1,"['it do have ', ' to pay tax']"
The amount of the fixed levy was established not in accordance with the parameters used to determine the amount of business tax but by reference to the earnings paid to the State by the entity from 1989 to 1990.,1,"['amount be establish accordance', ' to determine amount', ' pay entity', ' pay 1989']"
The fixed levy was also temporary.,1,[]
"On the other hand, under the special tax regime applicable from 1994 for an indef­ inite period, FT was required, in principle, to pay all the general law taxes.",1,"['ft be require principle', ' to pay taxis']"
"However, the rules governing its liability to business tax derogated from the general law and constituted the special tax regime.",1,"[' govern liability', 'rule derogate law', 'rule stitute regime']"
I  -  12970 JUDGMENT OF 8.,1,[]
"1 — CASE C-81/10 P 48 In those circumstances, the General Court was entitled to find, at paragraph 213 of the judgment under appeal, that the fixed levy must be regarded not as a charge con nected with the introduction of the special tax regime, but rather as a special tax mechanism for FT established for the years prior to 1994.",1,"['court be entitle ', ' to find paragraph', 'levy must be regard company', ' necte introduction', ' establish year']"
"In any event, as the General Court stated at paragraph 215 of the judgment under appeal, the mere fact that the fixed levy and the special tax regime were both introduced by Law No 90-568 does not prove that FT’s liability to pay the fixed levy from 1991 to 1993 was connected with the creation of the special tax regime for the years after 1994.",1,"['court state paragraph', 'levy be introduce number', 'fact do prove ', ' to pay levy', ' to pay 1991', 'liability be necte creation']"
"The General Court did not, therefore, err in law in concluding, at paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was entitled to refuse to apply a set- off between, on the one hand, the amounts paid by FT between 1991 and 1993 by way of fixed levy and, on the other, the tax differentials arising as a result of the special tax regime established for that company for the years 1994 to 2002.",1,"['court do number law', 'court do number cluding', 'court do number paragraph', 'commission be entitle ', ' to apply set-', ' to apply amount', ' pay ft', ' pay 1991', ' pay way', ' arise result', ' establish pany', ' establish year']"
"Lastly, even if it were the case that the tax regime applicable to FT consisted of two inextricably linked periods, the first entailing over-taxation and the second under- taxation, it is accepted that Law No 90-568 introduced with effect from 1994 a special tax regime intended to be of indefinite duration.",1,"['regime siste period', 'it be accept ', 'number introduce regime', 'number introduce effect', 'number introduce 1994']"
That law did not contain any mech- anism for offsetting amounts due by way of fixed levy for the period from 1991 to 1993 against amounts due as of 1994 under the special tax regime.,1,"['law do tain anism', ' offset amount']"
It therefore provided no mechanism for determining the point at which over-taxation under the first regime should have been offset under the second regime.,1,"['it provide mechanism', ' determine point', 'over should have be offset regime', 'taxation should have be offset regime']"
"As the Advocate General observed at point 100 of his Opinion, that over-taxation should have exhausted its effects at a given time, which necessarily entailed the conferring of an advantage on FT under the special tax regime.",1,"['general observe point', 'taxation should have exhaust effect', 'taxation should have exhaust time', 'which entail ferre', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre ft', 'company ferre regime']"

"Under that system, Member States are under an obligation, first, to notify to the Commission each measure intended to grant new aid or alter aid for the purposes of Article 87(1) I  -  12973 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION EC and, second, not to implement such a measure, in accordance with Article 88(3) EC, until that institution has taken a final decision on the measure.",1,"[' to number measure', ' to number commission', ' to grant aid', ' alter aid', ' alter purpose', ' to implement measure', ' to implement accordance', 'institution have take decision']"

"In so far as FT argues that there was no obligation to notify, because it had not been established that there was an advantage, it should be noted that neither the purported complexity of the tax regime at issue nor the periodic nature of the aid measure can release the Member State from its obligation to notify or give rise to any legitimate expectation on the part of the company receiving the aid.",1,"['ft argue ', 'there be obligation', 'it have be establish ', 'there be advantage', 'it should be e ', 'plexity can release state', 'plexity can release obligation', ' to number ify', 'plexity give rise', 'plexity give expectation', ' receive aid']"

"1 — CASE C-81/10 P 63 As regards the possible relevance of exceptional circumstances which may give rise, notwithstanding the considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, to a legit­ imate expectation that aid is lawful, it is sufficient to note that the General Court did not err in law in assessing such circumstances in the course of its detailed examin­ ation, at paragraphs 263 to 269 of the judgment under appeal, of all the arguments relied on before it in that regard.",1,"[' regard relevance', 'which may give rise', 'which may give expectation', ' withstand sideration', ' set paragraph', ' assess circumstance', ' assess rse', ' rely it', ' rely regard']"

It must therefore be concluded that the first part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.,1,['it must be clude ']
"The second part of the third ground of appeal, alleging an error in law as to the legal consequences flowing from another Commission decision on State aid — Arguments of the parties 66 FT is of the view that the General Court misinterpreted the legal consequences flow ing from the Commission’s decision of 8 February 1995 on La Poste (OJ 1995 C 262, p.",0,"[' allege error', ' flow decision', 'court misinterpret sequence']"

The argument based on the La Poste decision does not contain any analysis of the special business tax regime applicable to FT.,1,"[' base decision', 'argument do number ']"

"As regards the argument that FT could have interpreted the context in which the La Poste decision was adopted as a definition of the Commission’s opinion on the tax re gime at issue, it must be noted that the General Court, without erring in law, rejected that argument at paragraphs 265 to 269 of the judgment under appeal.",1,"[' regard argument', 'ld have interpret text', 'ld have interpret definition', 'decision be adopt ', ' err law', 'court reject argument', 'court reject paragraph']"

"Even if it were accepted that the special tax regime constituted State aid, the only binding legal act identifiable for the purpose of determining the point at which the limitation period started to run as regards the measure in question was Law No 90-568, which entered into force on 2 July 1990.",0,"['it be accept ', 'company stitute aid', ' determine point', 'period start ', ' regard measure', 'which enter force', 'which enter july']"

I  -  12978 JUDGMENT OF 8.,0,[]
1 — CASE C-81/10 P 79 The Commission states that the rules on limitation relating to State aid concern the recovery of such aid.,0,"['commission state ', ' relate company', 'rule cern recovery']"
Aid may be recovered only if it is possible to determine the aid amount.,0,"['aid may be recover ', ' to determine amount']"
"As regards the tax regime at issue, it was possible to identify the advantage only on an annual basis and a posteriori.",0,"[' regard regime', ' to identify advantage', ' to identify basis']"
"Findings of the Court 80 As regards the principle of limitation, Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 pro vides that the powers of the Commission to recover aid are to be subject to a limita tion period of 10 years.",1,"[' regard principle', 'article vide ', ' to recover aid']"
It is apparent from Article 15(2) of the regulation that the limitation period does not begin to run until on the day on which the unlawful aid is awarded to the beneficiary.,1,"['period do begin ', 'number do begin ', 'aid be award beneficiary']"
"Consequently, the decisive factor in determining the starting point of the limitation period referred to in Article 15 is when the aid was in fact granted.",1,"[' determine point', ' refer article', 'aid be grant ']"
"It is apparent from Article 15(2) of Regulation No 659/1999 that, for the purpose of determining the date on which the limitation period starts to run, that provision refers to the grant of aid to a beneficiary, not the date on which an aid scheme was adopted.",1,"[' determine date', 'period start ', 'provision refer grant', 'scheme be adopt ']"
The determination of the date on which aid was granted may vary depending on the nature of the aid in question.,1,"['aid be grant ', 'determination may vary ', ' depend nature']"
"Thus, in the case of a multi-annual scheme, entailing payments or advantages granted on a periodic basis, the date on which an act forming the legal basis of the aid is adopted and the date on which the undertakings concerned will actually be granted the aid may be a considerable period of time apart.",1,"[' entail payment', ' grant basis', ' form basis', 'act be adopt ', 'company cerne ', ' will be grant aid']"
"In such a case, for the purpose of calculating the limitation period, the aid must be regarded I  -  12979 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION as not having been awarded to the beneficiary until the date on which it was in fact received by the beneficiary.",1,"[' calculate period', 'aid must be regard tlcom', 'number having be award date', 'it be receive beneficiary']"
"It should be noted that, at recital 49 of the contested decision, the Commission stated that the limitation period started to run each year on the date on which the business tax was due from FT.",1,"['commission state ', 'period start ', ' to run date']"
"As is apparent from paragraph  320 of the judgment under appeal, the limitation period starts to run afresh each time an advantage is actually granted, which may be on an annual basis, so that the calculation of the limitation period may depend on how the advantage is identified.",1,"['period start ', 'advantage be grant ', 'calculation may depend ', 'advantage be identify ']"
"In the present case, since the finding as to whether aid existed depended on the differ ent rates applicable in each municipality within whose territory FT’s establishments were situated, the General Court carried out an analysis, at paragraph 323 of the judgment under appeal, of the fact that business tax is charged annually and the con sequences flowing from this.",1,"['aid exist ', 'finding depend rate', 'establishment be situate ', 'court carry analysis', 'court carry paragraph', 'tax be charge ', ' flow this']"
"The General Court was therefore correct in finding, at paragraph 324 of the judgment under appeal, that, in view of the annual nature of business tax, the aid at issue could not be regarded as having been awarded before the year 1994, because that was the year in which the binding legal acts were adopted which made it possible, for the first time, to establish the existence of a tax differential.",1,"[' find paragraph', 'number be regard ', ' having be award year', 'act be adopt ', 'which make ', ' to establish existence']"

"Moreover, the approach adopted by the General Court is confirmed by the wording of Article 15(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, from which it is apparent that it is the Com mission’s powers to recover aid which are subject to a limitation period.",1,"[' adopt court', 'approach be firm wording', ' to recover aid']"
"Lastly, as regards the argument that the General Court failed to have regard to the ob ligation to state reasons in relation to the principle of limitation, it is settled case-law that that court is not thereby required to provide an account that follows exhaustively and point by point all the reasoning articulated by the parties to the case.",1,"[' regard argument', 'court fail ', ' to have regard', 'it be settle law', 'rt be require ', ' to provide account', 'that follow reasoning', ' articulate party']"
"The reason ing may therefore be implicit on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the competent court with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see Case C-105/04 P Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Electrotechnisch Gebied v Commission [2006] ECR I-8725, paragraph 72; and Case C-3/06 P Groupe Danone v Commission [2007] ECR I-1331, paragraph 46).",1,"['it enable ', 'person to know ', 'measure be take ', 'it provide rt', 'it provide material', 'it to exercise power', ' see case']"
"It should be noted in that connection that, at paragraphs 323 and 324 of the judg ment under appeal, the General Court provided a clear assessment of the character istics of the business tax scheme, which enabled it to conclude, at paragraph 325 of the judgment, that the limitation period provided for under Article 15 of Regulation No 659/1999 had not expired by 28 June 2001, the date on which a request for infor mation was sent to the French Republic.",1,"['court provide assessment', 'court provide paragraph', 'which enable it', ' provide article', 'period have expire june', 'request be send ']"
"In those circumstances, the Court finds that the General Court responded to the requisite legal standard to the arguments relating to the principle of limitation relied on by FT and did not disregard the requirement to state reasons established in the case-law cited at paragraph 88 above.",1,"['court find ', 'court respond standard', 'court respond argument', ' relate principle', ' rely ft', 'court do disregard requirement', ' to state reason', ' establish law', ' cite paragraph']"

FT infers from this that the General Court infringed the principle of legal certainty since any amount to be recovered remains hypothetical and the quantification of re coverable aid cannot be based on approximate estimates.,0,"['ft infer this', 'court infringe principle', 'amount remain ', 'quantification can be not base estimate']"
I  -  12982 JUDGMENT OF 8.,0,[]
"1 — CASE C-81/10 P — The second part of the fifth ground of appeal, alleging failure to state reasons and error of law as regards the assessment of the methods of obtaining an approximate amount of the aid 95 FT submits that the General Court erred in law by finding, at paragraphs 297 and 305 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was justified in establishing a range encompassing the amount of aid to be recovered on the basis of estimates pro vided by the French authorities and that breach of the principle of legal certainty could not therefore be established.",0,"[' allege failure', ' regard assessment', ' obtain amount', 'part submit ', 'court err law', ' find paragraph', ' establish range', ' encompass amount', ' to be recover basis', ' vide authority', 'breach be establish ', 'number be establish ']"

"Those calculations were provided to demonstrate that any under-taxation of the company during that period was offset by the over-taxation which occurred during the first years of the special tax regime, namely during the period from 1991 to 1993.",0,"['calculation be provide ', 'taxation be offset taxation', 'which occur year']"
"In its response to the two parts of the fifth ground of appeal, the Commission submits that, in its findings concerning the principle of legal certainty, the General Court sim ply drew the appropriate conclusions from a number of elements in the judgment in Case C-441/06 Commission v France [2007] ECR I-8887.",0,"['commission submit ', ' cerne principle', 'ply draw clusion', 'ply draw number']"
"The Commission therefore considers that the General Court gave appropriate rea sons for its conclusion that FT was not justified in its submission that the principle of legal certainty had been infringed on the sole ground that, in order for the aid at issue to be recovered, it was necessary to specify the amount of aid.",0,"['court give rea', 'court give son', 'court give clusion', 'principle have be infringe ground', 'aid to be recover ', ' to specify amount']"
"I  -  12983 FRANCE TÉLÉCOM v COMMISSION Findings of the Court 99 On account of the connection between them, it is appropriate to examine both parts of the fifth ground of appeal together.",0,[' to examine part']
"The principle of legal certainty – which is one of the general principles of European Union law – requires that rules of law be clear and precise and predictable in their effect, so that interested parties can ascertain their position in situations and legal relationships governed by European Union law (see, to that effect, Case C-63/93 Duff and Others [1996] ECR I-569, paragraph 20; Case C-76/06 P Britannia Alloys & Chemicals v Commission [2007] ECR I-4405, paragraph 79; and Case C-158/07 Förster [2008] ECR I-8507, paragraph 67).",1,"['principle require ', 'party can ascertain position', ' govern law', ' see case', ' see effect']"
"As regards the argument relied on in support of the fifth ground of appeal, it should be observed that the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal, that, on the basis of the Commission’s estimates, the aid at issue amounted to between EUR 798 million and EUR 1 140 million.",1,"[' regard argument', ' rely support', 'it should be observe ', 'court point paragraph', 'aid amount 798million']"
"Since those figures delimit the range within which the final amount was to be established, the General Court found, referring in particular to paragraphs 31 to 40 of Commission v France, that the con tested decision contained the appropriate information to enable that amount to be determined without too much difficulty.",1,"['figure delimit range', 'court find ', ' refer paragraph', 'company taine information', 'amount to be determine difficulty']"
"It should also be noted that the Court of Justice held, at paragraph 29 of Commission v France, that no provision of European Union law requires the Commission, when ordering the recovery of aid declared incompatible with the common market, to fix the exact amount of the aid to be recovered.",1,"['court hold paragraph', 'provision require commission', ' order recovery', ' declare incompatible', ' to fix amount']"
"It is sufficient for the Commission’s de cision to include information enabling the recipient to calculate the amount itself, without overmuch difficulty (see also Case C-480/98 Spain v Commission [2000] ECR I-8717, paragraph 25, and Case C-415/03 Commission v Greece [2005] ECR I-3875, paragraph 39).",1,"['commissions to include information', 'commissions to include difficulty', ' enable recipient', ' to calculate amount', ' see case']"

"1 — CASE C-81/10 P 103 Thus, the General Court stated, at paragraphs 302 and 303 of the judgment under ap peal, that that range was based on estimates provided by the French authorities dur ing the administrative procedure and that, since that Member State had been unable to calculate exactly the amount of the advantage from which FT had benefited under the regime at issue, the Commission was entitled to rely on the data thus provided.",1,"['court state paragraph', 'range be base estimate', ' provide authority', ' e procedure', ' to calculate amount', 'ft have benefit regime', 'commission be entitle ', ' to rely datum']"
