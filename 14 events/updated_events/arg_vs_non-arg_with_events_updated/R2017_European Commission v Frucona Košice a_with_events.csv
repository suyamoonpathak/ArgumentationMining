"The [decision at issue] ... 25 In the [decision at issue], the Commission took the view, in particular, that it was necessary to examine the question, whether, in essence by accepting the proposed arrangement and therefore the remission of 65% of its claim, the local tax office had behaved towards the applicant like a private creditor in a market economy.",0,"['commission take view', ' to examine question', ' accept arrangement', 'office have behave applicant', 'office have behave creditor']"
The Commission stated in that regard that the position of that office as [Frucona Ko�ice]'s creditor was unusually strong in so far as that office was in a legally and economically more advantageous position than [Frucona Ko�ice]'s private creditors.,0,['commission state regard']
The local tax office held more than 99% of all claims registered and was a separate creditor whose claims could be satisfied at any time during the bankruptcy procedure from the sale of the secured assets (recital 80 of the [decision at issue]).,0,"['office hold 99', 'company ld be satisfy time', 'company ld be satisfy sale']"
"In the first place, as regards the private creditor test, the Commission noted, in particular, that the applicability of that test depended on the Member State concerned having conferred, other than in its capacity as public authority, an economic advantage on an undertaking, and that, if a Member State relied on that test during the administrative procedure, it must, where there is doubt, establish unequivocally and on the basis of objective and verifiable evidence that the measure implemented fell to be ascribed to the State acting as a private market operator.",0,"[' regard test', 'number e ', 'applicability depend ', 'company ferre advantage', 'state rely test', 'state rely procedure', 'there be doubt', 'it must establish basis', 'measure fall ', ' to be ascribe state', ' act operator']"

"In the second place, having noted, in recital 84 of the [decision at issue], that ""it is [Frucona Ko�ice] who argued that the measure [was] free of aid and submits the documents described above, in particular reports from two auditors"", the Commission determined whether the Slovak Republic had behaved, in relation to [Frucona Ko�ice], like a private creditor.",0,"[' have number', 'who argue ', 'who submit document', 'commission determine ', 'republic have behave relation', 'republic have behave creditor']"

"In support of its action, it raised four pleas in law alleging, first, an infringement of the rights of the defence, second, an error of law vitiating recital 83 of the decision at issue, third, errors of fact and of law vitiating the finding that the bankruptcy procedure was more advantageous than the proposed arrangement and, fourth, errors of fact and of law vitiating the finding that the tax execution procedure was more advantageous than the proposed arrangement.",0,"['it raise plea', ' allege infringement', ' vitiate recital', ' vitiate decision', ' vitiate finding', ' vitiate finding']"

"The second and fourth grounds of appeal, concerning the applicability of the private creditor test Arguments of the parties 10 By its second ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraphs 109 to 118 of the judgment under appeal, that the private creditor test may be usefully relied on by the recipient of the aid.",0,"['company cerne applicability', 'commission claim ', 'court err law', ' hold paragraph', 'test may be rely recipient']"
"According to the Commission, that test concerns the subjective state of mind of the public body when taking the decision to adopt the measure in question.",0,"[' accord commission', 'company cern state', ' take decision', ' to adopt measure']"
"Therefore, whether or not to reveal its intentions at that time is a choice that constitutes a subjective right of the Member State in question and, accordingly, that right cannot be invoked by third parties.",0,"[' to reveal intention', ' to reveal time', 'company stitute right', 'right can be not invoke party']"
"Moreover, only that Member State has at its disposal all the relevant evidence on the basis of which it formed its view at the time it took the decision to adopt the measure in question.",0,"['state have evidence', 'state have disposal', 'it form view', 'it form time', 'it take decision', ' to adopt measure']"
"It is, therefore, for the Member State to invoke the private creditor test and to provide the evidence required.",0,"['state to invoke test', 'state to provide evidence']"
"In the present case, as is clear from recitals 128 to 132 of the decision at issue, the Commission was in possession of evidence demonstrating that the Slovak Republic's position was clear and consistent, both in response to the complaint and at the time the arrangement was approved: the Member State had always indicated that, in its view, this was a matter of State aid.",0,"['arrangement be approve ', 'state have indicate ']"
"The Commission adds that, if it were correct to hold that the recipient of the aid can rely on the private creditor test, the General Court erred in law by not requiring Frucona Ko�ice, like it would a Member State, to establish unequivocally and on the basis of objective and verifiable evidence that the measure implemented falls to be ascribed to that Member State acting as a private creditor.",0,"['commission add ', 'recipient can rely test', 'court err law', 'court err number', ' require state', ' to establish basis', 'measure fall ', ' to be ascribe state', ' act creditor']"
"By its fourth ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in holding, in paragraph 247 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission cannot make a distinction, as regards the applicability of the private creditor test, based on the various alternatives to the measure in question.",0,"['commission claim ', 'court err law', ' hold paragraph', ' hold appeal', 'commission can not make distinction', ' regard applicability', ' base alternative']"
"As the application of the private creditor test is based on the evidence provided in order to establish its applicability, the error of the General Court lies in its decision that the application of that test is an abstract exercise aimed at reconstructing of its own motion the behaviour of the ideal, rational and fully informed hypothetical private creditor.",0,"['application be base evidence', ' to establish applicability', 'error lie decision', ' reconstruct behaviour', ' reconstruct motion']"
"Accordingly, where it is clear that no information on a particular course of action was put before the public creditor, there is no sense in comparing the behaviour of that entity with a similarly positioned private creditor.",0,"['information be put creditor', 'there be sense', ' pare behaviour', ' pare creditor']"
That test is therefore inapplicable in the present case.,0,[]
"The Commission submits that, in the present case, it is undisputed that no comparison of the proposed arrangement and the tax execution procedure was made at the time, for the purposes of the private creditor test.",0,"['commission submit ', 'parison be make time', 'parison be make purpose']"
"Accordingly, the General Court should have ruled on whether recital 120 of the decision at issue did in fact contain the implied conclusion that the private creditor test was not applicable.",0,"['court should have rule ', 'recital do tain clusion']"
Frucona Ko�ice contests the merits of the Commission's arguments.,0,['company test merit']
"Findings of the Court 19 According to the settled case-law of the Court, classification as 'State aid' within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU requires that all the conditions set out in that provision are fulfilled.",1,"[' accord law', 'classification require ', ' set provision', 'dition be fulfil ']"
"Thus, first, there must be intervention by the State or through State resources; second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient; fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v Hansestadt L�beck, C-524/14 P, EU:C:2016:971, paragraph 40, and of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C-20/15 P and C-21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53).",1,"[' to affect trade', 'it must distort ', 'it threaten ', ' to distort judgment']"
"The concept of 'aid' embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, therefore, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 30).",1,"['cept embrace benefit', 'which mitigate charge', 'which be include budget', 'which have judgment']"
"However, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as 'aid' for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited).",1,"['measure must meet ', ' to be treat aid', ' to be treat purpose', 'dition be meet ', 'company respond dition', 'recipient have obtain advantage', 'which have be make available', 'which have be make judgment']"
"When a public creditor grants payment facilities in respect of a debt payable to it by an undertaking, that assessment is made by applying, in principle, the private creditor test (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 32).",1,"['creditor grant facility', 'creditor grant respect', 'assessment be make ', ' apply judgment', ' apply principle']"
"Accordingly, the private creditor test is not an exception which applies only if a Member State so requests, when all the constituent elements of State aid incompatible with the common market, as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, exist.",1,"['which apply ', 'state request ', ' lay tfeu', 'element exist ']"
"In fact, that test, where applicable, is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing whether such aid exists (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C-124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 103, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 32).",1,"['commission be require ', ' to take account', ' to take purpose', 'aid exist ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"As a result, where it appears that the private creditor test might be applicable, it is for the Commission to ask the Member State concerned to provide it with all the relevant information enabling it to determine whether the conditions for applying that test are satisfied (judgment of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 33).",1,"['it appear ', 'commission to ask company', ' to provide it', ' to provide information', ' enable it', ' apply test', ' satisfy judgment']"
"In the first place, it is clear from that case-law of the Court that, when it appears that the private creditor test might be applicable, it is for the Commission to examine that possibility, irrespective of any request to that effect.",1,"['it appear ', 'commission to examine possibility']"
"Accordingly, as the Advocate General noted in points 72 and 76 of his Opinion, nothing prevents the recipient of the aid from invoking the applicability of that test and, if the recipient does invoke that test, it falls to the Commission to assess whether the test needs to be applied and, if so, to assess its application.",1,"['hing prevent recipient', ' invoke applicability', 'recipient do invoke test', 'it fall commission', 'test need ', ' to assess application']"
"In the second place, as regards the relevance of the subjective state of mind, it must be noted, as the Advocate General pointed out in point 74 of his Opinion, that the starting point for determining whether the private operator test is to be applied must be the economic nature of the Member State's action, not how that Member State, subjectively speaking, thought it was acting or which alternative courses of action it considered before adopting the measure in question.",1,"[' regard relevance', 'general point point', 'state think ', 'it be act ', 'it sidere ', ' adopt measure']"
"In any case, the private creditor test is intended to determine whether the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor that sought to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 72) and, accordingly, whether that undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 70).",1,"['test be intend ', 'undertaking would have obtain facility', 'undertaking would have obtain creditor', 'undertaking would have obtain situation', 'undertaking would have obtain judgment', 'that seek ', ' to recover sum', 'company respond dition', 'ld have obtain advantage', 'ld have obtain judgment', 'which have be make available']"
"It follows from this that the assessment which the Commission is required, where appropriate, to carry out cannot be limited to just the options that the competent public authority actually took into consideration, but must necessarily cover all the options that a private creditor would reasonably have envisaged in such a situation.",1,"['it follow this', 'commission be require ', 'assessment can be not limit option', 'authority take sideration', 'assessment must company option', 'creditor would have envisage situation']"
"As for the argument put forward by the Commission in the context of the fourth ground of appeal, it suffices to note that the General Court did not err in law when it stated, in paragraph 247 of the judgment under appeal, that, since the private creditor test was applicable as such, the Commission could not make a distinction, as regards the applicability of the test, based on the various alternatives to the measure at issue.",1,"[' put commission', ' put text', 'it suffice number', 'it state paragraph', 'number make distinction', ' regard applicability', ' base alternative']"
"Accordingly, the second and fourth grounds of appeal must be rejected as unfounded.",1,['ground must be reject ']
"The first ground of appeal, alleging misinterpretation of the decision at issue Arguments of the parties 32 By its first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court misinterpreted the decision at issue when it held, in paragraphs 101 to 104 of the judgment under appeal, that in the decision at issue the Commission had concluded that the private creditor test was applicable on the facts of the case.",0,"[' allege misinterpretation', ' allege argument', 'commission claim ', 'court misinterpret decision', 'it hold paragraph', 'commission have clude ']"

"That misinterpretation becomes apparent upon reading the subsequent recitals in that decision: recital 81 is not concerned specifically with the conditions under which that test is applicable, recital 82 specifically sets out the position in relation to the applicability of the test, and recital 83, as well as recitals 128 to 132, address whether that test is applicable.",0,"['misinterpretation become ', ' read recital', ' cerne dition', 'recital set position', 'recital address ']"

"Second, it must be noted that if the Commission had any doubt as to the applicability of the test, it should, as is clear from paragraph 24 of the present judgment, have asked the Slovak State for relevant information in that regard and carried out an overall assessment of that evidence (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C-124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 86).",1,"['commission have doubt', 'it should have ask state', 'it should have ask information', 'it carry assessment', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"However, the decision at issue makes no mention of such a request or such an assessment.",1,['decision make mention']
"Lastly, it should be noted that the Commission applied the private creditor test after having stated, in paragraphs 84 and 86 of the decision at issue, that the recipient had claimed that acceptance of the proposed arrangement did not constitute State aid because the bankruptcy procedure would have been less favourable for the Slovak State.",1,"['commission apply test', ' having state paragraph', 'recipient have claim ']"

"The third ground of appeal, concerning the principles res judicata and ne ultra petita Arguments of the parties 39 The Commission claims that the General Court misapplied the principles res judicata and ne ultra petita when it held, in paragraphs 123 to 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the Court of Justice had implicitly but necessarily held, in its judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission (C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32), that the private creditor test was applicable to the facts of the present case and that, therefore, to follow the Commission's interpretation of the decision at issue would be to disregard the force of res judicata.",0,"['company cerne argument', 'commission claim ', 'court misapply principle', 'it hold paragraph', 'court have hold judgment', ' to follow interpretation', ' to disregard force']"

"The fifth and sixth grounds of appeal, concerning the application of the private creditor test and the Commission's obligation to carry out a diligent and impartial investigation Arguments of the parties 42 By its fifth ground of appeal, the Commission, in the first place, claims that the private creditor test implies that the subjective view of the public body must be established and compared with the subjective view a private creditor would have taken in the same circumstances.",0,"[' to carry investigation', 'commission claim ', 'test imply ', 'view must be establish ', 'company pare view', 'creditor would have take circumstance']"
"In this respect, it follows from the case-law of the Court that the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the public body took the decision.",0,"['it follow law', 'body take decision']"
"The Commission infers from this that it is for the Member State concerned to show that, in order to make its decision, it did in fact take into consideration such evidence and developments, which must be comparable to the information a private operator would have required before making the same decision.",0,"['commission infer this', 'company cerne ', ' to make decision', 'it do take evidence', 'it do take sideration', 'operator would have require ', ' make decision']"
"According to the Commission, it follows from the Court's case-law that the private creditor test does not encompass a private creditor who acts fortuitously, but only one who acts in full knowledge of the facts, since, according to that case-law, economic evaluations made after the advantage was conferred, a retrospective finding that the investment made by the Member State was actually profitable, or subsequent justifications for the course of action actually chosen, do not suffice.",0,"[' accord commission', 'it follow law', ' encompass creditor', 'who act ', 'who act knowledge', ' accord law', 'advantage be ferre ', ' make state', 'evaluation do suffice ']"
"That does not mean that interested parties cannot bring forward information or evidence that is helpful in enlightening the Commission - for example on the nature and subject matter of the measure, its context or the objective pursued.",0,"['number mean ', 'party can not bring information', ' enlighten commission']"
"However, it is not for those parties to substitute their assessment for the one in fact made by the Member State at the time it took its decision, just as it is not for the Commission to presume to reconstruct of its own motion the behaviour of the ideal, rational and fully informed hypothetical private creditor.",0,"['party to substitute assessment', 'party to substitute one', ' make state', ' make time', 'it take decision', 'commission to presume ', ' to reconstruct behaviour', ' to reconstruct motion']"
"The information provided to the Commission in addition to that relied upon by the Member State concerned may seek to show that, on the basis of the information which the Member State did in fact take into account, a private creditor would or would not have acted in the same way.",0,"[' provide commission', ' provide addition', ' rely company', 'information may seek ', 'state do take account', 'creditor would have act way']"
"That information cannot, however, seek to justify the decision taken by reference to information or evidence that was not in fact considered by the Member State concerned.",0,"['information can not seek ', ' to justify decision', ' to justify reference', 'that be sidere company']"
"In the second place, the Commission claims that, when the General Court formulated its assessment criteria in paragraph 137 of the judgment under appeal, it failed to limit the Commission's verification obligation to the relevant information available to it.",0,"['commission claim ', 'court formulate criterion', 'court formulate paragraph', 'it fail ', ' to limit obligation', ' to limit information']"
"This failing led the General Court to consider, in paragraph 201 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission should have sought to obtain additional information with a view to verifying and substantiating its conclusions drawn by way of inference from the administrative file.",0,"['failing lead court', ' sider paragraph', 'commission should have seek ', ' to obtain information', ' to obtain view', ' substantiate clusion', ' draw way']"
"In paragraph 201, the General Court created a new requirement that the Commission has to reconstruct the behaviour of the ideal, rational and fully informed hypothetical private creditor by seeking any 'imaginable' information and evidence, which goes against the very philosophy forming the basis of the private creditor test, namely an assessment of the subjective state of mind of the public authority at the time of its decision.",0,"['court create requirement', ' to reconstruct behaviour', ' seek information', 'which go philosophy', ' form basis']"
"According to the Commission, paragraphs 137 and 180 to 213 of the judgment under appeal are thus based (i) on the flawed finding that the case-law of the Court of Justice required the Commission to carry out an objective and complete analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the bankruptcy procedure rather than an analysis based on the subjective situation of the public authority, and (ii) on an incorrect reading of the decision at issue to the effect that the institution had carried out such an analysis.",0,"[' accord commission', 'paragraph be base finding', 'law require commission', ' to carry analysis', ' base situation', 'institution have carry analysis']"
"In the third place, the Commission submits that the decision at issue is based on the state of Frucona Ko�ice's assets on 17 June 2004 and that, according to the General Court, the Commission was right not to accept the methodology of the E report as far as the determination of the liquidation factors for those assets is concerned.",0,"['commission submit ', 'decision be base state', 'decision be base june', ' accord court', ' to accept methodology']"
"However, as this was the only financial information available to the local tax authority when it decided to accept the proposed arrangement, the logical consequence of those findings of fact is that a private creditor with only that information at its disposal would not have entered into the arrangement.",0,"['it decide ', ' to accept arrangement', 'creditor would have enter arrangement']"
"Indeed, if a private creditor had requested additional information, it would not have entered into the proposed arrangement.",0,"['creditor have request information', 'it would have enter arrangement']"
"The Commission maintains that, given that it was obliged to carry out its verification exclusively by means of the information and evidence actually in the hands of the public creditor, or generally available as common knowledge, the administrative file, in any event, properly supported its conclusion that a private creditor would not have agreed to the arrangement.",0,"['commission maintain ', 'it be oblige ', ' to carry verification', ' to carry mean', 'file support clusion', 'creditor would have agree arrangement', 'number would have agree arrangement']"
"Indeed, the General Court did not point to any additional evidence that would have been relevant at the time the decision was made and that the Commission had failed to take into consideration.",0,"['decision be make ', 'commission have fail ', ' to take sideration']"
"Accordingly, the General Court erred in law by holding, in paragraphs 186 and 235 of the judgment under appeal, that the evidence in the administrative file was not such as to substantiate, to the requisite legal standard and unequivocally, the conclusions drawn by the Commission for the purposes of the assessment, at SKK 435 million (approximately EUR 14.5 million), of the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's assets upon bankruptcy.",0,"['court err law', ' hold paragraph', ' to substantiate clusion', ' to substantiate standard', ' draw commission', ' draw purpose', ' draw proceed']"
The Commission adds that the General Court does not identify what the standard of proof that the Commission should have provided might be nor whether it views that standard as being as high as establishing unequivocally what the proceeds would have been.,0,"['commission add ', 'court do identify ', 'commission should have provide ', 'it view standard']"
"In the fourth place, the Commission claims that the errors of law that it noted also vitiated the General Court's assessment of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure and of the tax execution procedure.",0,"['commission claim ', 'error vitiate assessment']"
Those assessments were based on the same wrong test and on the rejection of the Commission's evaluation of the proceeds of the liquidation of Frucona Ko�ice's assets.,0,['assessment be base test']
By its sixth ground of appeal the Commission claims that paragraphs 191 to 195 of the judgment under appeal can be interpreted as reproaching the Commission for breaching its obligation to conduct a diligent and impartial investigation.,0,"['commission claim ', 'paragraph can be interpret ', ' reproach commission', ' breach obligation']"
"The Commission submits that if this interpretation is correct, the General Court has misinterpreted the scope of that obligation and has imposed an excessive burden on it.",0,"['commission submit ', 'court have misinterpret scope', 'court have impose burden', 'court have impose it']"
"In this connection, the Commission claims that, in paragraphs 187 and 191 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission was right to reject the probative value of the E report and to therefore make inferences on the basis of the evidence put forward by Frucona Ko�ice or not contested by it.",0,"['commission claim ', 'court find ', ' to reject value', ' to make inference', ' put koice', ' test it']"

"Findings of the Court 58 As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the fifth and sixth grounds of appeal, in essence, relate to the extent of the Commission's investigation obligations when carrying out a private creditor test assessments, as held by the General Court during its examination of the parts of the decision at issue relating to the bankruptcy procedure and the tax execution procedure.",1,"['ground relate extent', ' carry assessment', ' hold court', ' hold examination', ' relate procedure']"
"In accordance with the Court's settled case-law, when applying the private creditor test, the Commission must carry out an overall assessment, taking into account all relevant evidence in the case enabling it to determine whether the recipient company would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from such a private creditor (see, to that effect, judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 73, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 47).",1,"[' apply test', 'commission must carry assessment', 'commission must carry judgment', ' take evidence', ' take account', ' enable it', 'company would have obtain facility', 'company would have obtain creditor', ' see effect']"
"In that regard, all information liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor, who is in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and is seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor experiencing difficulty in making the payments, must be regarded as being relevant (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 78, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 54).",1,"[' to have influence', 'who be seek ', ' to recover sum', ' to recover debtor', ' experience difficulty', ' make payment', 'creditor must be regard ']"
"Moreover, for the purposes of applying the private creditor test, the only relevant evidence is the information which was available, and the developments which were foreseeable, at the time when the decision was taken (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C-124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 105).",1,"[' apply test', 'decision be take ', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"Such an examination by the Commission of whether particular measures can be classified as State aid because the public authorities did not act in the same way as a private creditor requires a complex economic assessment (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 74, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 48).",1,"['measure can be classify aid', 'authority do act way', 'examination require judgment']"
"In this connection, it must be observed that, in the context of a review by the Courts of the European Union of complex economic assessments made by the Commission in the field of State aid, it is not for those Courts to substitute their own economic assessment for that of the Commission (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 75, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 49).",1,"['it must be observe ', ' make commission', ' make field', 'courts to substitute assessment', 'courts to substitute that']"
"However, the Courts of the European Union must, inter alia, establish not only whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the relevant information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (judgments of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraph 76, and of 21 March 2013, Commission v Buczek Automotive, C-405/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:186, paragraph 50).",1,"[' establish number', 'company tain information', 'which must be take account', ' to assess situation', ' substantiate clusion', ' draw it', ' draw judgment']"

"In this respect, first, it is necessary to reject the Commission's arguments alleging that the subjective state of mind of the competent public body must first be determined and that the attitude of that body must then be compared with that of a hypothetical private creditor: the relevance of such reasoning has already been rejected in the context of the examination of the second and fourth grounds of appeal in so far as that reasoning is based on an incorrect assessment of the private creditor test.",1,"[' to reject argument', 'state must be determine ', 'attitude must be pare that', 'relevance have be reject text', 'reasoning be base assessment']"
"Second, in so far as the Commission criticises the General Court for having created, inter alia by failing to limit the Commission's verification obligation to the evidence available to it, a new requirement imposing on it the excessive burden of having to seek all 'imaginable' evidence and information, it is clear that the Commission's argument is based on an incorrect reading of the judgment under appeal.",1,"['commission criticise court', ' to limit obligation', ' to limit requirement', ' impose burden', ' impose it', ' to seek evidence', 'argument be base reading']"
"In this respect, it must, first of all, be noted that the General Court indicated, inter alia in paragraphs 134 to 137 of the judgment under appeal, that the assessment of the private creditor test must be made in relation to a situation as close as possible to that of the public authority in question.",1,"['court indicate paragraph', 'assessment must be make relation']"
"Next, the General Court set out, in paragraphs 138 to 143 of the judgment under appeal, the principles that in its view govern the burden of proof on the Commission and, in that context, pointed out the evidence that the institution must, where appropriate, obtain and take into consideration in its examination, as well as the general limits of its investigatory obligations, as identified by the case-law of the Courts of the European Union.",1,"['court set principle', 'court set paragraph', 'that govern burden', 'court point evidence', 'institution must obtain ', 'institution take sideration', 'institution take examination', ' identify law']"
"In this connection, it should also be borne in mind that the lawfulness of a decision concerning State aid falls to be assessed by the European Union judicature in the light of the information available to the Commission at the time when the decision was adopted (judgment of 2 September 2010, Commission v Scott, C-290/07 P, EU:C:2010:480, paragraph 91 and the case-law cited).",1,"['it should be bear mind', ' cerne aid', 'lawfulness fall ', ' to be assess judicature', ' to be assess light', 'decision be adopt ']"
"However, the information 'available' to the Commission includes that which seemed relevant to the assessment to be carried out in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 59 to 61 of the present judgment and which could have been obtained, upon request by the Commission, during the administrative procedure.",1,"['information include that', 'which seem relevant', ' to be carry accordance', ' refer paragraph', ' have be obtain request', ' have be obtain procedure']"
"Lastly, in paragraphs 171 to 178 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court noted that, according to its case-law, the Commission is in no way subject to a general obligation to commission outside consultants, and on this ground rejected Frucona Ko�ice's claims that the institution should have obtained new reports by external experts.",1,"[' accord law', 'commission reject claim', 'institution should have obtain report']"
"Paragraphs 180 to 213 and 235 of the judgment under appeal, against which the Commission's objections referred to in paragraph 64 of the present judgment are directed, when read in the legal context referred to by the General Court, do not imply new requirements that are incompatible with the case-law of the Court of Justice.",1,"[' refer paragraph', 'objection be direct ', ' read text', ' refer court', 'paragraph do imply requirement']"
"Thus, the factual findings made in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal - that the Commission had determined the liquidation factors by way of inference from the evidence in the administrative file, had not carried out any methodological or economic analysis and had not requested additional information intended to verify and substantiate the conclusions which it had drawn from that evidence - cannot be read as containing a requirement that goes beyond those demanded by the principles noted by the General Court in paragraphs 138 to 143 of the judgment under appeal or that would be incompatible with those set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the present judgment.",1,"[' make paragraph', 'commission have determine factor', 'commission have determine way', 'commission have carry analysis', ' have request information', ' substantiate clusion', 'it have draw evidence', 'finding can be not read taine', 'company taine requirement', 'that go those', ' demand principle', ' e court', ' set paragraph']"
"Concerning the General Court's findings of fact in paragraphs 186, 196, 200 and 201 of the judgment under appeal - that the evidence on the administrative file did not substantiate to the requisite legal standard the Commission's assessment of the liquidation factors and that, accordingly, it should have sought to obtain additional information in order to substantiate its conclusions - these assessments in no way exceed the limits of judicial review of a manifest error of assessment which is to be carried out by the General Court in accordance with the case-law noted in paragraph 64 of the present judgment, and cannot be considered to introduce a requirement that would be incompatible with the principles set out in paragraphs 59 and 60 of the present judgment.",1,"[' concern finding', 'evidence do substantiate assessment', 'evidence do substantiate standard', 'it should have seek ', ' to obtain information', ' to substantiate clusion', 'assessment exceed limit', ' to be carry court', ' to be carry accordance', 'assessment can be not sidere ', ' to introduce requirement', ' set paragraph']"
"To the extent that the General Court held, in paragraph 186 of the judgment under appeal, that the evidence on the administrative file must substantiate the conclusions drawn by the Commission not only to the requisite legal standard but also unequivocally, it suffices to note that it is clear from paragraphs 187 to 201 of the judgment under appeal that, in any case, the General Court did not carry out its assessment by reference to such a requirement and did not allude to it in the context of its considerations in paragraphs 196, 200, 201 and 235 of the judgment under appeal.",1,"['court hold paragraph', 'evidence must substantiate clusion', 'evidence must substantiate standard', ' draw commission', 'it suffice ', 'court do carry assessment', 'court do carry reference', 'court do carry text', 'court do allude it']"
"As the Advocate General noted in paragraphs 125 and 131 of his Opinion, the General Court merely noted, in paragraphs 191 to 195, 198 and 199 of the judgment under appeal, the internal contradictions of the decision at issue and made findings of fact according to which none of the evidence on the administrative file was able to substantiate the liquidation factors used by the Commission.",1,"[' make finding', ' to substantiate factor', ' use commission']"
"Accordingly, contrary to the Commission's submissions, the General Court did not apply an incorrect legal test.",1,['court do apply test']
"It follows that the Commission's claims must be rejected as, in part, ineffective and, in part, unfounded.",1,"['it follow ', 'claim must be reject ']"
"In the second place, in so far as the Commission claims that the errors of law which it identified also vitiated the General Court's assessment of the length of the bankruptcy procedure, in paragraphs 223 to 235 of the judgment under appeal, as well as its assessment of the tax execution procedure, in paragraphs 277 to 284 of that judgment, it is sufficient to state that, since an examination of the Commission's claims has not led to a finding of an error of law, that line of argument is wholly unfounded.",1,"['commission claim ', 'it identify ', 'error vitiate assessment', 'examination have lead finding']"
"Moreover, in paragraphs 279, 282 and 283 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the Commission had failed, first, to obtain information on the anticipated duration of a tax execution procedure, second, to take into account that it was likely to be interrupted by the initiation of the bankruptcy procedure and, third, to obtain information concerning the costs that such a procedure might generate.",1,"['court find ', 'commission have fail ', ' to obtain information', ' to take account', ' to be interrupt initiation', ' to obtain information', ' cerne t', 'procedure might generate ']"
"Such considerations, in so far as they concern the information that a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local tax office could not a priori ignore, are capable, in themselves, of justifying the General Court's decision that the Commission failed to take into consideration all the relevant information (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 January 2013, Frucona Ko�ice v Commission, C-73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32, paragraphs 77, 78 and 81).",1,"['they cern information', 'number ignore ', ' justify decision', 'commission fail ', ' to take sideration', ' see effect']"
"Furthermore, it follows from paragraphs 69 to 84 of the present judgment that, contrary to the Commission's claim, it is apparent from the judgment under appeal that the General Court did explain, to the requisite legal standard, first, the extent of the Commission's investigation obligations and, second, the kind of additional evidence the Commission could have requested.",1,"['it follow paragraph', 'court do explain extent', 'court do explain standard', 'ld have request ']"
