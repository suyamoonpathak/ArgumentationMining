"In any event, in the absence of prior notification of the impugned tax measure, the appellant could not plead that the Commission had failed to act.",0,"['number plead ', 'commission have fail ']"
"Accordingly, the Court of First Instance was correct to find that there had been no legitimate expectation.",0,[]
"Findings of the Court 44 It should be borne in mind, first, that in view of the mandatory nature of the review of State aid by the Commission under Article 93 of the Treaty, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not, in principle, entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that article and, second, that a diligent businessman should normally be able to determine whether that procedure has been followed (Case C-5/89 Commission v Germany [1990] ECR I-3437, paragraph 14; Case C-169/95 Spain v Commission [1997] ECR I-135, paragraph 51; and Case C-24/95 Alean Deutschland [1997] ECR I-1591, paragraph 25).",1,"['it should be bear mind', 'aid have be grant ', 'undertaking may number principle', ' entertain expectation', 'it have be grant pliance', ' lay article', 'procedure have be follow i-3437']"
"In particular, where aid is paid without prior notification to the Commission, so that it is unlawful under Article 93(3) of the Treaty, the recipient of the aid cannot have at that time a legitimate expectation that its grant is lawful (see Alean Deutschland, cited above, paragraphs 30 and 31).",1,"['aid be pay number', 'recipient can not have expectation', 'recipient can not have time', 'recipient see deutschland']"
"In the present case, the Court of First Instance stated at paragraph 235 of the judgment under appeal that it was not disputed that the tax credit of 45% had been introduced without prior notification, in infringement of Article 93(3) of the Treaty.",1,"['court state paragraph', 'it be dispute ', 'credit have be introduce ification', 'credit have be introduce infringement']"
"At paragraph 236 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance correctly held, referring inter alia to Commission v Germany, cited above, that the argument based on the principle of the protection of legitimate interests could not be upheld.",1,"['company hold ', ' refer alia', ' refer commission', ' base principle', 'argument be uphold ']"
"At the following paragraph of that judgment, the Court of First Instance correctly stated that the applicant's argument was based on a misreading of Decision 93/337.",1,"['company state ', 'argument be base misreading']"
"In that decision, as the Court of First Instance emphasised, the Commission had characterised the aid in question as incompatible with the common market not only because it was contrary to Article 52 of the Treaty but also, at Part V of that decision, in which the Commission examines the possibility of applying one of the derogations provided for in Article 92 of the Treaty, because it did not comply with the various rules relating to aid.",1,"['court emphasise ', 'commission have characterise aid', 'commission examine possibility', ' apply one', ' provide article', ' relate aid']"
"More specifically, in Decision 93/337 the Commission: — had stated that the aid in question included a tax credit of 20% in respect of investments (Part I); I - 10644 DEMESA AND TERRITORIO HISTÓRICO DE ALAVA v COMMISSION had considered that, for the purpose of applying the derogation provided for in Article 92(3) (c) of the Treaty, the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines of 19 August 1992 on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (OJ 1992 C 213, p.",1,"['commission have state ', 'aid include credit', ' apply derogation', ' provide c', 'dition lay oj', 'dition lay guideline']"
"), which, after defining in point 2.2 the components of the category of small and medium-sized enterprises, stated, at point 4.1, fifth paragraph, that the Commission had decided to allow investment aid only up to the levels of 15% of the investment for small enterprises and 7.5% of the investment for other enterprises in the same category, were not satisfied (Part V); had ordered the Spanish authorities to ensure that the aid was granted, inter alia, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (Article 1(4)).",1,"[' define ponent', ' define point', 'which state point', 'commission have decide ', ' to allow aid', ' have order authority', 'aid be grant accordance', ' lay guideline']"
It is thus apparent that Demesa could not infer from Decision 93/337 that a tax credit of 45% granted to an undertaking of a size allowing it to make a minimum investment of ESP 2 500 million required by the Sixth Additional Provision of Norma Foral 22/1994 could not be categorised as aid for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.,1,"['number infer decision', 'it to make investment', ' require provision', 'credit be categorise aid']"
"In the light of the terms of Decision 93/337, the appellant cannot therefore claim the possibility, which cannot be excluded (see Commission v Germany, cited above, paragraph 16), for the recipient of unlawful aid to rely on exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it legitimately assumed the aid to be lawful.",1,"['appellant can not claim possibility', 'which can be not exclude ', 'recipient to rely circumstance', 'it assume ']"

"That conclusion is incorrect, because it was formulated at an inappropriate point in the interpretation process.",0,['it be formulate point']
"In reality, the Court of First Instance should, before addressing any question of categorisation as State aid, have considered that a tax measure adopted before the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning taxation policy (OJ 1998 C 2, p.",0,"[' address question', 'court should have sidere measure', ' adopt policy', ' adopt clusion']"

"Findings of the Court 59 It must be borne in mind that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the Court of First Instance would be to allow it to bring before the Court, whose jurisdiction in appeals is limited, a case of wider ambit than that which came before the Court of First Instance.",1,"['it must be bear mind', 'party to put plea', 'party to put time', 'party to put court', 'it have ', 'number raise court', 'it to bring case', 'it to bring court', 'which come court']"
"In an appeal the Court's jurisdiction is thus confined to review of the findings of law on the pleas argued before the Court of First Instance (see, in particular, Case C-136/92 P Commission v Brazzelli Lualdi and Others [1994] ECR I-1981, paragraph 59; Case C-7/95 P Deere v Commission [1998] ECR I-3111, paragraph 62; and Case C-217/01 P Hendrickx v Cedefop [2003] ECR I-3701, paragraph 37).",1,"[' fine review', ' argue court', ' see case']"
"In the present case, the Territorio Histórico de Álava did not contend at first instance that: — the impugned tax measure is excluded as such from the scope of the law on State aid; Article 92 of the Treaty has applied to the provisions of tax law only since the conclusions of the Ecofin Council meeting on 1 December 1997 concerning tax policy and the Commission notice of 10 December 1998 on the application of the State aid rules to measures relating to direct business taxation.",1,"['company tend instance', 'measure be exclude scope', ' have apply provision', ' have apply clusion', ' relate taxation']"
"In reality, it referred to the economic-policy objectives of the impugned tax measure in the course of argument as to whether that measure was justified by the nature and scheme of the tax system, that is to say, at the stage of the argument concerning the categorisation of the measure as State aid incompatible with the common market for the purposes of Article 92 of the Treaty.",1,"['it refer objective', 'it refer company', 'measure be justify nature', 'company cerne categorisation']"
T h e Court of First Instance examined the corresponding arguments at paragraphs 167 and 168 of the judgment under appeal.,1,"['court examine argument', 'court examine paragraph']"
"The argument submitted to the Court in the present appeal, namely that, in substance, the impugned tax measure was excluded from the outset, at a stage preceding the legal reasoning, from the scope of Article 92 of the Treaty and, subsequently, from actual review by the Commission, therefore constitutes a plea raised for the first time in the appeal.",1,"[' submit court', ' submit appeal', 'measure be exclude outset', 'measure be exclude stage', 'measure be exclude scope', ' precede reasoning', 'company stitute plea', ' raise time', ' raise appeal']"
