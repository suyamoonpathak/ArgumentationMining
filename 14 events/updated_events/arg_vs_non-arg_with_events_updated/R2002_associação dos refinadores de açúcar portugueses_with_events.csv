"The Commission contended that those reliefs were covered by the decision of 3 July 1991 and that it had therefore confined itself to recording, in the contested decision, that those reliefs constituted existing aid.",0,"['company tend ', 'relief be ere decision', 'it have fine itself', ' record decision', 'company stitute aid']"
"In its view, the annulment of the contested decision could in no way call such aid into question, so that the applicants had no interest in bringing proceedings.",0,"['annulment test ld', ' call aid', ' call question', 'applicant have interest', ' bring proceeding']"
The Court of First Instance rejected that plea of inadmissibility.,0,['court reject plea']
It held that it had first of all to examine whether those measures were compatible with the common agricultural policy in order to assess whether they were actually covered by the decision of 3 July 1991 and then to consider whether that decision was lawful.,0,"['it hold ', 'it have order']"
"It stated that, if it were to annul the contested decision because of the incompatibility of those reliefs with the rules of the common agricultural policy or because the decision of 3 July 1991 was unlawful, that annulment would have the effect of calling into question the aid paid to DAI, which demonstrated that the applicants had an interest in bringing proceedings.",0,"['it state ', ' to annul decision', ' to annul incompatibility', 'annulment would have effect', ' call aid', ' call question', 'which demonstrate ', 'applicant have interest', ' bring proceeding']"

"It held that the applicants could secure compliance with the procedural guarantees afforded them by Article 92(2) of the Treaty as interested third parties, if the Commission decided not to open the procedure under that provision, only if they had the opportunity to challenge that decision before the Court of First Instance.",0,"['it hold ', 'applicant secure pliance', 'company secure pliance', ' afford they', ' afford article', ' afford party', 'commission decide number', ' to open procedure', ' to open provision', 'they have opportunity', ' to challenge decision', ' to challenge court']"

The first plea raised by the applicants as regards the tax reliefs was that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal.,0,"[' raise applicant', ' regard relief']"
"As regards the objection of inadmissibility raised against that plea on the basis that the applicants should have brought an action against those measures before the national court, relying on Article 184 of the EC Treaty (now Article 241 EC) in order to prevent implementation of the decision, the Court of First Instance held, at paragraphs 46 to 50 of the judgment under appeal, that that objection could not be upheld.",0,"[' regard objection', ' raise plea', ' raise basis', 'applicant should have bring action', 'applicant should have bring rt', ' rely article', ' to prevent implementation', 'court hold paragraph', 'number be uphold ']"
"It held that effective judicial protection of the applicants' rights was assured only if they had an opportunity to raise an objection alleging the irregularity of the decision of 3 July 1991 in proceedings challenging the Commission decision relating to individual aid, which alone allowed them to determine precisely the extent to which their individual interests are affected.",0,"['it hold ', 'protection be assure ', 'they have opportunity', ' to raise objection', ' allege irregularity', ' challenge decision', ' relate aid', 'which allow ', 'they to determine extent', 'interest be affect ']"

"Further, it pointed out that the aid granted in the sugar sector under the general scheme of tax reliefs did not escape Commission control since the Commission could at any time verify the compatibility of such individual aid with that decision and in particular with the rules applicable to the agricultural sector concerned.",0,"['it point ', ' grant sector', ' grant scheme', 'aid do escape trol', 'company verify patibility', 'company verify decision']"
"The second part of the first plea, alleging a lack of transparency in the procedure for approval of the decision of 3 July 1991, was rejected by the Court of First Instance at paragraphs 61 to 63 of the judgment under appeal.",0,"[' allege lack', 'part be reject court', 'part be reject paragraph']"
The Court of First Instance held that the lack of any publicity concerning notification and examination of a grant of aid under Article 93(3) of the Treaty cannot be assimilated to a lack of transparency.,0,"['court hold ', 'company cerne ification', 'lack can be not assimilate lack']"
"While the Court recognised that the examination of State aid forming part of the preliminary stage did not enable the Commission to take account of the interests of third parties, it pointed out that the procedure incorporated sufficient guarantees and was therefore fully justified by the need to avoid delay where it was clear that the measure notified by the Member State concerned or complained about by a third party did not constitute State aid or constituted State aid compatible with the common market.",0,"['court recognise ', ' form part', 'examination do enable commission', ' to take account', ' to take interest', 'it point ', 'procedure incorporate guarantee', ' to avoid delay', ' ifie company', ' plain party', 'number do number stitute', 'number do number market', ' stitute company']"
"The Court of First Instance also rejected, at paragraphs 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal, the third part of the first plea, concerning the alleged impropriety of the internal procedure for the adoption of the decision of 3 July 1991, since the applicants had not, in its view, produced any significant evidence capable of raising serious doubts as to the legality of that procedure.",0,"['court reject part', 'court reject paragraph', 'company cerne impropriety', 'applicant have produce evidence', ' raise doubt']"

"It recalled that the Court of Justice had held, in Case C-47/91 Italy v Commission [1994] ECR I-4635, that once a general aid scheme has been approved by the Commission, the individual implementing measures do not need to be notified to it unless reservations to that effect were expressed in the approval decision.",0,"['it recall ', 'court have hold case', 'scheme have be approve commission', ' implement measure', 'individual do need ', ' to be ifie it', 'reservation be express decision']"
"It stated that direct examination of each individual aid would, in that case, be contrary to the principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty.",0,['it state ']
The Court of First Instance also held that an individual aid granted in implementation of a general aid scheme could not in principle be regarded as an unforeseeable application of that scheme.,0,"['court hold ', ' grant implementation', 'aid be regard application']"
"The Court of First Instance also observed that, in the present case, the tax reliefs did not exceed 10% of the investment made and were compatible with the Community law applicable in the sector concerned.",0,"['court observe ', 'relief do number ', ' exceed 10']"
"According to the Court of First Instance, they therefore complied with the conditions laid down by the decision of 3 July 1991 and did not thus need to be notified to the Commission, so that it would not have been entitled to examine them in the light of Article 92 of the EC Treaty.",0,"[' accord court', 'they ply dition', ' lay decision', 'they do need ', ' to be ifie commission', 'it would have be entitle ', ' to examine they', ' to examine light']"

"It went on to point out that those tax reliefs, which were intended to facilitate the development of certain economic regions in accordance with Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, were compatible with the aims pursued by both Regulation No 1785/81 and by the Community's structural measures in the agricultural sector.",0,"['it go ', 'which be intend ', ' to facilitate development', ' to facilitate accordance', ' pursue number']"
"The Court of First Instance concluded that the applicants' arguments concerning aggravation of the overproduction of sugar in the Community and an increase in the charges borne by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, were not such as to call into question the aid for the setting up of a beet sugar refinery in Portugal.",0,"['company clude ', ' cerne aggravation', ' bear section', ' to call aid', ' to call question', ' set refinery']"

"It went on to point out that, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice (Case C-225/91 Matra v Commission [1993] ECR I-3203, paragraphs 24 and 25), in its review of the legality of a decision taken under Article 92(3)(c) of the Treaty, the Community Court must restrict itself to determining whether the Commission has exceeded the scope of its discretion by a manifest error of assessment or by misuse of powers.",0,"['it go ', ' accord law', ' take article', 'court must restrict itself', 'commission have exceed scope', 'commission have exceed error']"
"The Court of First Instance held, finally, that the applicants had put forward no argument sufficient to call into question the notion that the vocational training aid at issue would contribute to the development of certain economic activities without adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.",0,"['court hold ', 'applicant have put argument', ' to call number', ' to call question', 'aid would company tribute', 'aid would company development', ' affect dition', ' affect extent']"
The applicants put forward two pleas in law in support of the claim for annulment of the contested decision in so far as it relates to investment aid under Regulation No 866/90.,0,"['applicant put plea', 'applicant put law', 'applicant put support', 'applicant put number', 'it relate aid']"
"First, they submitted that grants of State aid fulfilling the conditions laid down by that regulation to qualify for Community co-financing were nevertheless subject to the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.",0,"['they submit ', ' fulfil dition', ' lay regulation', ' to qualify financing']"
"Second, they claimed that Regulation No 866/90 excluded investment aid at issue.",0,"['they claim ', 'number exclude aid']"
"At paragraphs 111 to 120 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the first of those pleas, which it held to be based on Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81, which provides, on the basis of Article 42 of the Treaty, that Article 92 of the Treaty inter alia applies to production of and trade in agricultural products only to the extent determined by the Council.",0,"['court reject first', 'it hold ', 'which to be base article', 'which provide basis', 'article apply production', 'article apply extent', ' determine council']"
"The Court of First Instance noted, first of all, that actions of a structural nature conducted under the auspices of the Guidance Section of the EAGGF did not fall within the scope of Regulation No 1785/81 but within that of Regulation No 866/90, a regulation based on Article 42 of the Treaty and Article 43 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 37 EC).",0,"['number e ', ' ducte auspex', 'action do fall scope', ' base article']"
"It inferred from the absence of any provision in Regulation No 866/90 expressly providing for the application of I - 4364 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and Article 94 of the EC Treaty (now Article 89 EC) to aid eligible for Community co-financing under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, that such aid had to be assessed in the specific context of the common action undertaken in accordance with that regulation and could not be the subject of examination under Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.",0,"['it infer absence', ' provide application', 'aid have ', ' to be assess text', ' undertake accordance']"
"The Court of First Instance went on to point out that, even if Article 44 of Regulation No 1785/81 could be interpreted as specifically providing for the application of Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty to every aid measure concerning sugar production and marketing, it had to be applied having regard to the aims of the common agricultural policy, whose precedence over the application of the Treaty provisions relating to competition is enshrined in the Treaty itself, in Article 42.",0,"['court go ', 'article be interpret ', ' provide application', ' cerne production', 'it have ', ' have regard', ' relate petition', 'precedence be enshrine treaty', 'precedence be enshrine article']"
"According to the Court, the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to aid eligible for Community co-financing in the context of Regulation No 866/90 would be liable to frustrate the pursuit of certain aims of the common agricultural policy by means of specific structural action undertaken in conformity with the criteria laid down in Decision 94/173.",0,"[' accord court', ' to aid eligible', ' to aid text', ' to frustrate pursuit', ' to frustrate mean', ' undertake formity', ' undertake criterion', ' lay decision']"
"The Court held that Regulation No 866/90 itself ensured the consistency of investment aid, co- financed by the Community and the Member State concerned pursuant to that regulation, with the common agricultural policy.",0,"['court hold ', 'number ensure sistency', 'number ensure policy', ' finance community']"
It thus concluded that the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty to investment aid eligible for Community co-financing under Regulation No 866/90 would be incompatible with the precedence over the rules on competition accorded by the Treaty to the common agricultural policy.,0,"['it clude ', ' accord treaty']"
"Finally, at paragraph 124 of the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance rejected the applicants' second plea, according to which the investment aid was excluded by Regulation No 866/90 because it was incompatible with the common agricultural policy and could not be based on Decision 94/173, which was itself incompatible with that policy.",0,"['court reject plea', 'aid be exclude number', 'number be base decision']"
"The Court held, referring to paragraphs 89 and 90 of its judgment, that aid granted with a view to utilising the quota allocated to mainland Portugal was not incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy.",0,"['court hold ', ' refer paragraph', ' grant view', ' utilise quota', ' allocate portugal']"

Admissibility of the main appeal 47 The Commission and DAI seek a declaration by the Court that the main appeal is clearly inadmissible since it does no more than repeat or reproduce verbatim the pleas in law relied on before the Court of First Instance and contains no specific legal argument for having the judgment under appeal set aside.,1,"['commission seek declaration', 'it do number ', ' reproduce plea', ' rely court', 'judgment set ']"
"According to settled case-law, where an appeal merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the Court of First Instance, including those based on facts expressly rejected by that Court, it fails to satisfy the requirements under Article 51 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 112(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure.",1,"[' accord law', 'appeal repeat ', 'appeal reproduce plea', ' submit court', ' include those', ' base fact', ' reject court', 'it fail ', ' to satisfy requirement']"
"In reality, such an appeal amounts to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the Court of First Instance, which, under Article 49 of the EC Statute of the Court of Justice, falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (see, in particular, the order of 25 March 1998 in Case C-174/97 P FFSA and Others v Commission [1998] ECR I-1303, paragraph 24).",1,"['appeal amount number', ' submit court', 'which fall jurisdiction', ' see order']"

"2 — CASE C-321/99 P The Commission's cross-appeal Arguments of the parties 52 The Commission contends that the action before the Court of First Instance, to the extent that it was directed against the part of the contested decision relating to tax reliefs, was inadmissible.",0,"['company tend ', 'it be direct part', ' relate relief']"
"The Court was wrong to hold, at paragraphs 35 to 37 of the judgment under appeal, that a letter from the Commission containing information that an individual aid is covered by a general aid scheme already approved by the Commission always constitutes an act susceptible to judicial review under Article 173 of the Treaty.",0,"[' to hold paragraph', ' taine information', 'aid be ere scheme', ' approve commission', 'letter stitute act']"
The Commission contends that at first instance the appellants had no legal interest in seeking annulment of the contested measure because annulment would not affect their legal position in any way.,0,"['company tend ', 'appellant have interest', ' seek annulment', 'annulment would affect position', 'annulment would affect way']"
That measure merely recorded that the tax reliefs at issue constituted existing aid covered by an approved general scheme.,0,"['measure record ', 'relief stitute ']"
"It thus had no legal effects and could not, therefore, be regarded as constituting a decision.",0,"['it have effect', 'number be regard ', 'company stitute decision']"
The Commission puts forward the following arguments in support of its contentions.,0,"['commission put argument', 'commission put support']"
"As a preliminary point, the Commission contends that the statements by the Court of First Instance at paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal that, on the one hand, the objection of inadmissibility raised by the Commission could not be upheld and, on the other hand, the question of inadmissibility could not be examined at that stage of the judgment, contradict one another.",0,"['company tend ', ' raise number', 'objection be uphold ', 'question be examine stage']"
That internal contradiction is incompatible with the obligation to state reasons under Article 190 of the EC Treaty (now Article 253 EC).,0,"[' to state reason', ' to state article']"
"The Commission's other arguments develop its central assertion that the contested measure is not in the nature of a decision as regards the appellants as third parties, but rather a statement of facts.",0,"['argument develop assertion', ' regard appellant']"
"The reasoning followed by the Court of First Instance, which makes the question of the admissibility of the action I - 4370 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION conditional on examination of its merits, allows complainants to call into question, by means of a challenge to an individual aid, the validity of a Commission decision approving a general aid scheme, a decision which is, after all, by then definitive.",0,"[' follow court', 'which make ', 'reasoning allow ', 'question allow ', 'plainant to call validity', 'plainant to call question', 'plainant to call mean', ' approve scheme']"

"Complainants are thereby given a further means of redress, whereas their objections in connection with aid such as that at issue should be made before the national court, it being for that court to refer, if it considers it necessary, a question to the Court of Justice on the validity of the decision approving the general aid scheme.",0,"['complainant be give means', 'objection should be make rt', 'rt to refer question', ' approve scheme']"

The Commission contends that it constitutes an error in law to base the admissibility of an action for annulment before the Court of First Instance on the subjective view of the applicant.,0,"['company tend ', 'company stitute error', ' to base admissibility', ' to base view']"
"The appellants submit, as regards the alleged contradiction between paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission has not established an error of law.",0,"['appellant submit ', ' regard tradiction', 'commission have establish error']"

"As regards the other arguments of the Commission, the appellants submit that the grounds of the judgment under appeal must be upheld.",0,"[' regard argument', 'appellant submit ', 'ground must be uphold ']"
They take the view that the question of the admissibility of the action for annulment does indeed depend on the question whether the tax reliefs granted under Decree-Law No 95/90 fall within the scope of the decision of 3 July 1991.,0,"['they take view', 'question do depend question', ' grant number', 'relief fall scope']"

"Judicial protection of the appellants under the rules relating to State aid entails that their action be held admissible, as it represents the only legal means of examining the legality of the decision of 3 July 1991 and of assessing whether the individual aid measure at issue complied with the general scheme.",0,"[' relate aid', 'protection entail ', 'action be hold admissible', 'it represent mean', ' examine legality', 'measure ply scheme']"
"As regards the Commission's argument that the Court should set aside the words 'in their view' in paragraph 36 of the English version of the judgment under appeal, the appellants submit that the Court of First Instance did not base the admissibility of the action on a subjective analysis of their interests.",0,"[' regard argument', 'court should set word', 'court should set appeal', 'appellant submit ', 'court do base admissibility', 'court do base analysis']"

The Court of First Instance considered the merits of that view at paragraphs 44 to 50 of the judgment under appeal.,0,"['company sidere merit', 'company sidere paragraph']"
"Findings of the Court 59 First, it is clear from reading paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment under appeal that they are not vitiated by any contradiction, contrary to the contention of the Commission.",1,"[' read paragraph', 'they be vitiate tradiction']"
"To begin with, in paragraph 35, the Court of First Instance rejected the objection of inadmissibility raised by the Commission.",1,"['court reject objection', ' raise commission']"
In paragraph 36 it set out the reasons why it considered that the objection could not be upheld.,1,"['it set reason', 'it sidere ', 'number be uphold ']"
"Whilst, at the end of paragraph 36, it deferred consideration of one question of admissibility, that question concerned the more specific allegation by the Commission that the objection that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal was itself inadmissible.",1,"['it defer sideration', 'company cerne allegation']"
The Court of First Instance analysed that separate question at paragraphs 44 to 50 of the judgment under appeal.,1,"['court analyse question', 'court analyse paragraph']"
The argument alleging a contradiction in the grounds thus cannot be upheld.,1,"[' allege tradiction', 'argument can be not uphold ']"
"Second, as regards the appellants' interest in bringing proceedings against the part of the contested decision relating to tax reliefs, it is clear from the case-law of the I - 4372 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION Court of Justice, as the Commission points out, that individual grants of aid under a general aid scheme approved by the Commission which meet the conditions of that scheme constitute existing aid which does not need to be notified (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraphs 21 to 26).",1,"[' regard interest', ' bring proceeding', ' relate relief', 'commission point ', ' approve commission', 'which meet dition', 'grant stitute aid']"
"Since it is not notified before it is implemented, such aid does not require an express decision by the Commission and its legality can only be assessed by the national courts (TWD Textilwerke Deggendorf, cited above, paragraphs 15 to 18).",1,"['it be implement ', 'aid do require decision', 'legality can be assess company']"
"However, the background to the present dispute is not the same.",1,[]
"It is clear from the documents on the Court file that the individual tax reliefs at issue were examined by the Commission, which had received complaints about them from the appellants.",1,"['relief be examine commission', 'which have receive plaint', 'which have receive appellant']"
"The Commission took the view that those measures did comply with the two conditions laid down by the decision of 3 July 1991 for them to be classified as existing aid, exempt as such from formal notification and from examination of their compatibility with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty.",1,"['commission take view', 'measure do ply dition', ' lay decision', 'they to be classify aid']"
"In taking that position, the Commission did not confine itself to recording that the individual measures at issue were in the nature of existing aid.",1,[' take position']
"Taking the view that those measures were covered by the decision of 3 July 1991, it also decided not to open the procedure provided for by Article 93(2) of the Treaty.",1,"[' take view', 'measure be ere decision', 'it decide ', ' to open procedure', ' provide article']"
"The appellants, who could have intervened as complainants in such a procedure if the Commission had opened it, would be deprived of that guarantee if they did not have the option of challenging before the Court of First Instance the assessment made by the Commission (see, to that effect, Case C-198/91 Cook v Commission [1993] ECR I-2487, paragraphs 20 to 24).",1,"['who ld have intervene plainant', 'who ld have intervene procedure', 'commission have open it', 'appellant would be deprive guarantee', 'they do have option', ' challenge assessment', ' challenge court', ' make commission', ' see effect']"

"The merits of the main appeal The first plea, concerning the objection that the decision of 3 July 1991 was illegal Arguments of the parties 65 By their first plea the appellants allege that the Court of First Instance erred in law in holding, at paragraphs 55 to 57 of the judgment under appeal, that the decision of 3 July 1991, by which the Commission approved the general scheme of tax reliefs laid down by Decree-Law No 95/90, ensured compliance with the rules applicable to the sugar sector.",0,"['company cerne objection', 'appellant allege ', 'court err law', ' hold paragraph', 'commission approve scheme', ' lay number', 'decision ensure pliance']"
They submit that that conclusion is based on two erroneous findings.,0,"['they submit ', 'clusion be base finding']"
"I - 4374 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION 66 First, in the decision of 3 July 1991, the Commission made the grant of individual aid under Decree-Law No 95/90 conditional on compliance with the 'rules and guidelines laid down by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors'.",0,"['commission make grant', ' lay law', ' lay relation']"
"However, contrary to what the Court of First Instance held, such a condition is inadequate and too imprecise to be regarded as an appropriate condition to safeguard the interests of the common agricultural policy in a sensitive sector such as sugar.",0,"['court hold ', ' to be regard dition', ' to safeguard interest']"

"In that connection, the appellants submit that the Commission's powers under Article 93(1) of the Treaty, which do not allow it to suspend the payment of aid, cannot be regarded as an appropriate alternative to the procedure provided for by Article 93(2) and (3) of the Treaty, where a general aid scheme is applied.",0,"['appellant submit ', 'which do allow ', 'it to suspend payment', 'power can be not regard alternative', ' provide article', 'scheme be apply ']"
"Moreover, the position of third parties is substantially weaker in the case of 'constant review' under Article 93(1) of the Treaty than it is in the case of the application of Article 93(2) and (3) of the Treaty.",0,[]
"The Commission contends that this plea, which merely repeats the arguments relied on at first instance, is not admissible.",0,"['company tend ', 'which repeat argument', ' rely instance']"
"As to the merits, it agrees with the analysis set out at paragraphs 55 to 57 of the judgment under appeal and contends that, when it approves a general aid scheme, it must, as it did in the present case, take the necessary steps to ensure that the relevant special sectoral rules that it has adopted are also taken into consideration.",0,"['it agree analysis', ' set paragraph', 'company tend ', 'it approve scheme', 'it approve case', ' take step', 'it have adopt ', 'rule be take sideration']"

"Since approval by the Commission of such schemes is legally possible, the reasoning it followed in I - 4375 JUDGMENT OF 16.",0,['it follow judgment']

"The Portuguese Government dismisses, moreover, the appellants' suggestion that the approval of such a scheme must be accompanied by a statement of the applicable sectoral conditions.",0,"['government dismiss suggestion', 'approval must be accompany statement']"
"Such a solution entails practical and legal disadvantages, since the alleged need to set out the sectoral conditions would detract from the clarity of the scheme.",0,"['solution entail disadvantage', ' to set dition', 'need would detract clarity']"

"In the event, the Commission made the approval under its decision of 3 July 1991 subject to the express condition that the individual aid was in conformity with 'the rules and guidelines laid down by Community law in relation to certain industrial, agricultural and fisheries sectors'.",1,"['commission make ', ' lay law']"
It also required the Portuguese Government to notify 'all projects enjoying reliefs of between 10 and 20% (ESL) and all those in sensitive sectors'.,0,"['it require government', ' to number project', ' enjoy relief']"
The appellants have not put forward any more arguments than they did at first instance capable of establishing that those instructions were in breach of the rules applicable to the sugar sector or were insufficient to the extent that the decision of 3 July 1991 was vitiated by illegality.,1,"['appellant have put argument', 'decision be vitiate illegality']"

"The decision of 3 July 1991 thus does not have the effect of preventing the legitimate interests of third parties from being taken into account and cannot, therefore, be regarded as an illegal restriction of the scope of Article 93(2) and (3) of the Treaty.",1,"['decision do have effect', ' prevent interest', ' be take account', 'decision can be not regard restriction']"

"Aid which constitutes the strict and foreseeable application of the conditions laid down in the decision approving the general aid scheme is thus considered to be existing aid (Italy v Commission, cited above, paragraph 25), which does not need to be notified to the Commission or examined in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty.",1,"['which stitute application', ' lay decision', ' approve scheme', 'which do need ', ' to be ifie commission', 'which examine light']"
"In the present dispute, as pointed out at paragraph 20 of this judgment, the decision of 3 July 1991, approving the aid scheme set up by Decree-Law No 95/90, made authorisation for tax reliefs subject to two conditions, compliance with which the Commission, in the contested decision, verified before confirming that they had been fulfilled.",1,"[' point paragraph', ' approve scheme', ' set number', 'decision make ', 'commission verify ', 'company firm ', 'they have be fulfil ']"

"It is clear from the terms of the contested decision that the Commission took the view that the project for the construction of a beet sugar refinery in Portugal, eligible for Community financing under the EAGGF, was therefore compatible with the objectives of the common agricultural policy.",1,['commission take view']
"It follows from the foregoing that, in holding, at paragraphs 72 to 75 of the judgment under appeal, that the tax reliefs granted to DAI did not need to be notified and that the Commission was not entitled to examine them directly in relation to Article 92 of the Treaty, the Court of First Instance did not err in its application of Community law.",1,"['it follow forego', ' hold paragraph', 'relief do need ', 'commission be entitle ', ' to examine they', ' to examine relation', ' do number application']"
"The second plea must, therefore, be rejected.",1,['plea must be reject ']

They rely on three arguments in support of that plea.,0,['they rely argument']

"In the absence of such exceptional authorisation in that Act, it must be assumed that the rule prohibiting aid for the processing of sugarbeet in Regulation No 1785/81 applies to the investment project at issue.",0,"['it must be assume ', ' prohibit aid', ' prohibit number', 'rule apply project']"
"Next, the appellants claim that the Court of First Instance erred in holding, at paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal, that the grant of a sugar quota to the Portuguese Republic entitled the Portuguese Government to grant State aid for the construction of a sugar refinery in mainland Portugal, aid which, in their view, creates an entirely artificial sugar producer and distorts competition by aggravating overproduction on the common market in sugar.",0,"['appellant claim ', 'court err ', ' hold paragraph', 'grant entitle government', ' to grant aid', 'which create producer', 'which distort petition', ' aggravate overproduction']"
"Finally, contrary to what the Court of First Instance held at paragraph 90 of the judgment under appeal, neither Regulation No 866/90 nor Decision 94/173 support the conclusion that the aid concerned is compatible with the common market organisation for sugar.",0,"['court hold paragraph', 'number support clusion']"
"The appellants assert that Decision 94/173 unlawfully made investment in the Portuguese beet sugar industry eligible for Community co-financing and that, in that decision, the Commission mistakenly considered it to be eligible simply because Portugal had been granted a sugar quota.",0,"['appellant assert ', 'decision make ', 'commission sidere ', 'portugal have be grant quota']"
They point out that this error was perpetuated in the Community guidelines for State aid in connection with investments in the processing and marketing of agricultural products.,0,"['they point ', 'error be perpetuate guideline']"
The Commission contends that this third plea is inadmissible for the same reasons as the first two pleas are.,0,['company tend ']
"As to the substance, it submits that the provisions I - 4382 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION relating to the accession of Member States other than the Portuguese Republic are not at all relevant in this case and that the legal basis for the aid at issue is the decision of 3 July 1991.",0,"['it submit ', ' relate accession']"
It argues that the appellants fail to take account of the fact that Regulation No 866/90 and Decision 94/173 are an integral part of the common agricultural policy.,0,"['it argue ', 'appellant fail ', ' to take account', ' to take fact']"
"Regulation No 1785/81 should be interpreted in conjunction with those texts, which provide expressly for an exception to the rule of prohibition of State aid in the sugar sector in respect of the Portuguese quota.",0,"['number should be interpret junction', 'which provide exception']"
"Moreover, the contested aid was, according to the Commission, authorised also as regional aid, an area in which the Commission has a wide discretion in determining what is compatible with the common market.",0,"[' accord commission', 'aid be authorise aid', 'commission have discretion']"
The Portuguese Government points out that Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90 allows Member States to take aid measures in addition to Community action.,0,"['government point ', 'article allow ', 'states to take measure']"
"Moreover, Article 25 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Azores and Madeira relating to certain agricultural products (OJ 1992 L 173, p.",0,"['article cerne measure', ' relate product']"
"), provides for aid to be granted for the development of sugar beet production and the processing of sugar beet harvested in the Azores into white sugar, up to the limit of a total annual production of 10 000 tonnes of refined sugar, which shows that, at Community level, aid measures in the sugar sector are not regarded with total disfavour.",0,"['aid to be grant development', ' harvest azores', 'which show ', 'measure be regard disfavour']"
"The Portuguese Government then points out that the sugar quota granted to the Portuguese Republic was contained in an instrument of the highest rank, namely, the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic.",0,"['government point ', ' grant republic', 'quota be taine instrument']"
DAI submits that aid to promote utilisation of the sugar quota allocated to the Portuguese Republic by the Act of Accession cannot be construed as contrary to the aims of the common agricultural policy.,0,"['dai submit ', ' to promote utilisation', ' allocate republic', ' allocate act', 'aid can be not strue company']"
It adds that the Court of First Instance did not hold that the legality of the aid granted to DAI follows automatically from the fact that Portugal was granted a sugar quota in that Act of Accession.,0,"['it add ', 'court do hold ', 'legality follow fact', 'portugal be grant quota', 'portugal be grant act']"
"On the contrary, it is clear from the Court's reasoning that the legal basis for the grant of such aid is to be found in the relevant provisions of Regulation No 866/90 and Decision 94/173.",0,[' to be find provision']
"First, by their third plea, supported by detailed arguments, the appellants set out clearly their challenge to the grounds of the judgment under appeal.",1,"[' support argument', 'appellant set challenge']"
This plea is therefore admissible.,1,[]
"Second, the tax reliefs granted to DAI must, as the decision of 3 July 1991 provides, comply with the rules of the common agricultural policy in the sugar sector laid down by Regulation No 1785/81.",1,"['decision provide ', 'relief must ply rule', 'company must ply rule', ' lay number']"
"Article 44 of that regulation provides that Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty are to apply to the production of, and trade in, sugar.",1,"['article provide ', ' to apply production']"
That article also provides that that general rule is to be applicable 'save as otherwise provided in this Regulation'.,1,"['article provide ', ' provide regulation']"
"Article 45 thereof provides that it is to be applied so that appropriate account is taken, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 of the EC Treaty (now Article 33 EC).",1,"['article provide ', 'account be take time', ' set article', ' set number']"
"Moreover, as the Court of First Instance pointed out at paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal, Article 24 of that regulation was specifically amended by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic so as to allow to that Member State, on its mainland, the benefit of a production quota of 60 000 tonnes for sugar.",1,"['court point paragraph', 'article be amend act', ' to allow benefit']"
"It is clear from those provisions that, while it does not, per se, authorise the payment of State aid to a project intended to utilise that quota, Regulation No 1785/81 in no way precludes that possibility.",1,"['it do authorise payment', ' to utilise quota', 'number preclude possibility']"
At paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance made the same preliminary finding and thus did not consider that the tax reliefs in I - 4384 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION favour of DAI could be declared compatible with the common agricultural policy solely because of the allocation of that quota.,1,"['court make finding', 'court do ', 'i be declare patible', 'i be declare allocation']"
"Accordingly, the argument that, unlike the Act of Accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic did not contain a clause providing for the exceptional grant of State aid is, in any event, redundant.",1,[' provide grant']
"Article 45 of Regulation No 1785/81 refers to the general objectives of the common agricultural policy set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, which include, in Article 39(2)(a), taking account of 'the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions'.",1,"['article refer objective', ' set article', 'which include article', ' take account', ' take nature', 'which result structure']"
The rules applicable to investment in the sugar sector are thus not only those established by Regulation No 1785/81.,1,[' establish number']
They also appear in the legislative texts governing the structural and regional policy measures of the Community.,1,"['they appear text', ' govern measure']"
"Those texts make provision for the Community, or the Portuguese Republic, to grant financial support for the investment project at issue.",1,"['text make provision', 'community to grant support']"
"First of all, Article 16(5) of Regulation No 866/90, a regulation adopted on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty and thus an integral part of the common agricultural policy, makes provision for Member States to grant, over and above the measures specifically provided for by that regulation, aid for the processing and marketing of agricultural products, under the conditions laid down by Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty.",1,"[' adopt basis', 'article make provision', 'state to grant aid', 'state to grant dition', ' provide regulation', ' lay article']"
"Next, the aid granted to DAI meets the criteria for eligibility of investment liable to benefit from financial aid under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF laid down by Decision 94/173.",1,"['aid meet criterion', ' to benefit aid', ' lay decision']"
"That decision provides, at point 2.8 of its annex, that, by I - 4385 JUDGMENT OF 16.",1,['decision provide point']
"2 — CASE C-321/99 P way of exception to the rule which excludes investment in the sugar sector, investment for the purpose of the utilisation of the quota provided for in the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic may be given Community financing.",1,"['which exclude investment', ' provide act', ' may be give financing']"
"By the contested decision, the Commission indicated that in the sector of the processing and marketing of agricultural products, State aid must meet the criteria for selection of investments set by Decision 94/173.",1,"['commission indicate ', 'aid must meet criterion', ' set decision']"
"That guideline is the same as that in the Commission communications relating to State aid in that sector such as those of 12 July 1994 and 23 March 1995 and the communication of 2 February 1996, issued after the events which are the subject of this dispute.",1,"[' relate aid', ' issue event']"
"Next, in taking the view that the objectives of the regional and agricultural policy of the Community justified the particular treatment of the investment project at issue, as regards a region covered by Objective No 1, the Commission did not exercise its discretion in a manifestly erroneous way.",1,"[' take view', 'objective justify treatment', ' regard company', ' ere number', 'commission do exercise discretion', 'commission do exercise way']"
Nor did it disregard the terms of the authority conferred on it by Article 8 of Regulation No 866/90 to fix criteria for the eligibility of investments for Community action.,1,"['it do disregard term', ' ferre it', ' ferre article', ' to fix criterion']"
"Finally, it must be pointed out that the fact that the investment made by DAI is specifically taken into account is a result precisely of the special treatment given to the Portuguese Republic by the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic, as the Court of First Instance observed at paragraph 89 of the judgment under appeal.",1,"['it must be point ', ' make dai', 'investment be take account', ' give act', 'court observe paragraph']"
"Accordingly, the appellants' argument that the contested decision creates an artificial sugar producer and distorts competition by aggravating overproduction on the common market in sugar must be rejected.",1,"['decision create producer', 'decision distort petition', ' aggravate overproduction', 'argument must be reject ']"
"I - 4386 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION 107 It follows from the foregoing that, in holding that the tax reliefs granted to DAI were not incompatible with the aims of the common agricultural policy, the Court of First Instance did not err in law.",1,"['i follow forego', 'it follow forego', ' do err law']"
"Accordingly, the third plea can only be rejected.",1,['plea can be reject ']
"The fourth plea relating to the error in law made by the Court of First Instance in refusing to assess the effect of the contested aid measures taken together Arguments of the parties 108 By their fourth plea the appellants complain that the Court of First Instance did not take account, at paragraphs 98 to 101 of the judgment under appeal, of the effect of the various contested aid measures taken together.",0,"[' relate error', ' make court', ' to assess effect', 'court do take account', 'court do take paragraph']"
"Those measures altogether represent more than 60% of the investment made by DAI and allow it to produce a surplus corresponding to 20 to 25% of national consumption, with guaranteed prices and a cost of less than 40% of fixed costs which can be written off over a very long period.",0,"['measure represent 60', ' make dai', 'measure allow ', 'it to produce company', ' respond 25', 'which can be write period']"
DAI was thus placed in an extremely advantageous position.,0,['dai be place position']
The Commission contends that this plea is clearly inadmissible.,0,['company tend ']
"As to the substance, it argues that the plea cannot succeed as it has a wide discretion in this matter and no manifest error can be established.",0,"['it argue ', 'plea can not succeed ', 'it have discretion', 'error can be establish ']"

"They did not thus put forward a general claim for annulment directed at the contested decision as a whole, alleging that the Commission should have assessed the compatibility of the cumulative effect of the three contested measures in the light of Article 92 of the Treaty, as is confirmed by the part of their application entitled 'General grounds of the action' which does not mention that claim.",1,"['they do put claim', ' direct decision', 'commission should have assess patibility', 'commission should have assess light', ' be firm part', ' entitle ground', 'which do mention claim']"
"Thus, the Court of First Instance, at paragraph 98 of the judgment under appeal, pointed to the fact that the three types of aid examined in the contested decision were covered by different sets of legal provisions and had therefore to be examined individually in the light of those rules and the aims which they pursued, only in order to conclude that the compatibility with Article 92 of the Treaty of the aid for vocational training had to be considered separately and that specific plea rejected.",1,"['court point fact', ' examine decision', 'type be ere set', 'type have ', ' to be examine light', 'they pursue ', 'company have ', 'plea reject ']"
The plea put forward by the appellants in the appeal is thus wider in scope than that put before the Court of First Instance.,1,"[' put appellant', ' put appeal', ' put court']"

I - 4392 ARAP AND OTHERS v COMMISSION 127 DAI contends that this ground of appeal is clearly inadmissible because it merely repeats the arguments put before the Court of First Instance without indicating the error of law allegedly made by it.,0,"['i tend ', 'company tend ', 'it repeat argument', ' put court', ' indicate error', ' make it']"
"Findings of the Court 128 First, the sixth plea is admissible as it is directed against duly identified grounds of the judgment under appeal and does not merely reproduce the terms of the application to the Court of First Instance.",1,"['it be direct ground', 'plea do reproduce term']"
"Second, it is clear from the argument of the appellants that, in this plea, they submit that, in rejecting their claim that the investment aid in question could not fall within the scope of Regulation No 866/90, the Court of First Instance did not rule on their arguments that the aid did not fulfil the basic conditions laid down by Articles 2 and 11 to 13 of that regulation.",1,"['they submit ', ' reject claim', 'aid fall scope', 'court do rule argument', 'aid do fulfil dition', ' lay article']"
"That part of the judgment is thus, it is alleged, vitiated by a failure to state sufficient reasons.",1,"['it be allege ', 'part be vitiate failure', ' to state reason']"
"However, it must be borne in mind that, in the contested decision, the Commission took the view that the aid in question fell, on first analysis, within the scope of Regulation No 866/90.",1,"['it must be bear mind', 'commission take view', 'aid fall analysis', 'aid fall scope']"
"It concluded from this that the aid could not be examined directly in relation to Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and stated that it would analyse subsequently, in the light of Regulation (EEC) No 866/90, the aspect of co-financing of the project under that regulation.",1,"['company clude this', 'number be examine relation', 'company state ', 'it would analyse aspect', 'it would analyse light']"
"The Commission thus did not consider whether the project fulfilled the conditions for Community co-financing by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, nor, therefore, whether the national contribution to that project met the basic conditions of the regulation.",1,"['commission do sider', 'project fulfil dition', 'tribution meet dition']"
I - 4393 JUDGMENT OF 16.,1,[]
"2 — CASE C-321/99 P 131 The appellants criticised that appraisal before the Court of First Instance, arguing that the investment project in question did not fall within the scope of Regulation No 866/90 and that, therefore, Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty were applicable in the case.",1,"['appellant criticise appraisal', 'appellant criticise court', 'project do fall scope']"
"They put forward two pleas in support of that complaint: the first was that Decision 94/173, adopted pursuant to Regulation No 866/90, was incom­ patible with the common agricultural policy and, therefore, illegal, while the second was that the basic conditions laid down by that regulation were not, in the event, met.",1,"['they put plea', 'they put support', ' lay regulation']"
"While, in order to reject the claim that Articles 92 and 93 were applicable to the project at issue, the Court of First Instance was obliged to rule, as it did at paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal, on the plea that Decision 94/173 was incompatible with the common agricultural policy, since that decision determined the scope of Regulation No 866/90, it did not have to rule on the arguments in support of the second plea, relating to the fulfilment of the basic conditions of that regulation, which did not affect the legality of the contested decision and were, therefore, inoperative.",1,"[' to reject claim', 'court be oblige ', ' to rule plea', 'decision determine scope', 'it do have ', ' to rule argument', ' relate fulfilment', 'which do affect legality']"
"Accordingly, in referring to paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment under appeal when rejecting the plea that the aid at issue was not within the scope of Regulation No 866/90, the Court of First Instance did not vitiate the judgment by an insufficient statement of reasons.",1,"[' refer paragraph', ' reject plea', 'court do vitiate judgment', 'court do vitiate statement']"
"The sixth plea must, therefore, be rejected.",1,['plea must be reject ']
It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the appeal must be dismissed in its entirety.,0,"['it follow sideration', 'appeal must be dismiss entirety']"

"Since the Commission and DAI have applied for costs and the appellants have been unsuccessful, the appellants must be ordered to pay the costs.",0,"['commission have apply t', 'appellant must be order ', ' to pay t']"
