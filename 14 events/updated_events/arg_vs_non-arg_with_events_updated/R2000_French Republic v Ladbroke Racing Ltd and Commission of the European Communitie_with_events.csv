"The Commission went on to point out that whereas the markets in games of chance have traditionally been partitioned along national lines, betting on horse-races on national courses is organised internationally, and it was not until January 1989, when the Pari Mutuel International (""the PMI"") was set up, that the PMU expressly made clear its desire to extend its activities beyond France by concluding agreements in Germany and Belgium, and by thereby entering into competition with other betting organisations and particularly with Ladbroke (part III of the contested decision).",0,"['commission go ', 'market have be partition line', 'betting be organise ', 'international be set ', 'pmu make ', ' to extend activity', ' to extend france', ' to extend agreement', ' enter petition', ' enter organisation']"

"It also regarded the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT as a cash-flow benefit equivalent to State aid; however, the Commission found that this had been offset between 1989 and its abolition on 1 July 1993 by a permanent deposit lodged with the French Treasury (parts IV and V, point 6).",0,"['it regard exemption', 'it regard benefit', 'commission find ', 'this have be offset 1989', ' lodge treasury', ' lodge iv', ' lodge point']"
"Lastly, as regards the PMU's exemption from the social housing levy, the Commission considered that, even though the Conseil d'État held in a 1962 judgment that horse-racing was an agricultural activity and therefore exempt from such contributions, the PMU's activity — organising and processing bets — fell manifestly outside the scope of agricultural activities.",0,"[' regard exemption', 'company sidere ', 'dtat hold judgment', ' process bet', 'activity fall scope']"
"Accord- ingly, since the exemption at issue was not justified under the PMU's articles of association, it constituted State aid (parts IV and V, point 7).",0,"['it stitute iv', 'it stitute point']"

"As regards the aid resulting from the waiver of the amounts deriving from the practice of rounding down winnings to the nearest ten centimes, the Commission took the view that, although the intensity of that aid was high (almost 29% of the total cost of computerisation), ""given the state of development of competition and trade before the setting-up of the PMI in January 1989, the aid granted between 1982 and 1985 for the computerisa- tion of the PMU did not produce any disruptive effects on the market contrary to the common interest, bearing in mind the direct and indirect effects of the aid in developing all the economic factors making up the sector, including the improvement of bloodstock"" (part VII, point 1).",0,"[' regard aid', ' result waiver', ' derive practice', ' round winning', ' round centime', 'commission take view', ' give state', ' grant 1982', 'aid do produce effect', ' bear effect', ' bear mind', ' develop factor', ' make sector', ' include improvement']"
"I-3314 FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 24 In the case of the exemption from the one-month delay rule for the deduction of VAT, the Commission took the view that — for the same reasons as were cited in connection with the aid just referred to — it had likewise to be regarded as compatible with the common market up to January 1989.",0,"['commission take view', ' be cite nection', ' to be regard company']"
"Thereafter, any adverse effects of that aid on competition were offset in full by a permanent deposit lodged with the Treasury (part VII, point 2).",0,"['effect be offset deposit', ' lodge treasury', ' lodge part']"
"As for the aid attributable to the exemption from the housing levy, the Commission considered that, like the aid resulting from the exemption from the one-month delay rule for deduction of VAT, it qualified up to 1989 for the derogation provided for in Article 92(3)(c); thereafter, however, it had to be declared incompatible (part VII, point 3).",0,"['company sidere ', ' result exemption', 'it qualify derogation', ' provide article', 'it have ', ' to be declare incompatible']"
"However, with regard to the obligation to repay the aid obtained in that form as of 1989, the Commission stated that ""... repayment as from that date should not be required in view of the French authorities' argument that the contribution could not be levied because of the 1962 decision of the Conseil d'État referred to in part IV, point 7"" (see above, paragraph 21); none the less, ""[that] argument cannot be accepted as from the time when the initiation of proceedings was notified to the French authorities, namely on 11 January 1991"".",0,"[' to repay aid', ' obtain form', 'commission state ', 'repayment should be require view', 'number should be require view', 'number be levy ', ' refer part', 'argument can be not accept ', 'initiation be ifie authority']"

"Their use to finance in particular social security expenditure together with monitoring and supervision costs, horse-breeding incentives and investment connected with the organisation of horse-racing and totalisator betting cannot therefore be regarded as State aid, since the State resources criterion is not met (parts IV and V, point 1).",0,"[' to finance expenditure', ' to finance necte', ' necte organisation', 'use can be not regard aid', ' meet iv']"
"As regards the change in the allocation of the public levies (see above, paragraph 16), the Commission stated that the tax arrangements applicable to horse-races are the responsibility of the Member States and increases or reductions in the rate of tax do not constitute State aid provided that they apply uniformly to all the undertakings concerned.",0,"[' regard change', 'commission state ', 'increase do number aid', 'they apply undertaking']"
The question of State aid arises only where a significant reduction in the rate of taxation strengthens the financial situation of an undertaking in a monopoly position.,0,"['question arise ', 'reduction strengthen situation']"
"That was not the case here, however, in so far as the 1984 reduction in the public levy on bets was limited (some 1.6%) and subsequently maintained, and was thus not designed to finance a specific ad hoc operation.",0,"['reduction be limit ', 'reduction maintain ', ' to finance operation']"
The French authorities acted with the aim of increasing the resources of the recipients of the non- public levies on a permanent basis.,0,"['authority act aim', ' increase resource', ' increase basis']"

"As regards the PMU's exemption from corporation tax, the Commission took the view that, in so far as corporation tax ""cannot apply to the [economic interest group] PMU since its legal form is that of an economic interest grouping"", the exemption must ""be considered to stem from the normal application of the general tax system"" (part V, point 4).",0,"[' regard exemption', 'commission take view', 'tax can not apply group', 'exemption must be sidere ', ' to stem application']"

"I-3318 FRANCU V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION The judgment under appeal 4 In the judgment under appeal, the Court of First Instance held that in the case of decisions as to whether a measure is to be characterised as State aid, which, under the Treaty, are the responsibility of both the Commission and the national courts, there is in principle no reason to attribute a broad discretion to the Commission in the absence of special circumstances arising from the complex nature of the State intervention in question.",0,"['court hold ', ' to be characterise aid', 'there be reason', 'there be number', ' to attribute discretion', ' to attribute commission', ' to attribute absence', ' arise nature']"

"In the light of those considerations, the Court of First Instance first examined the three criteria used by the Commission to determine whether the change in the allocation of levies in 1985 and 1986 fell within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty (paragraphs 55 to 66).",0,"['court examine criterion', ' use commission', 'change fall scope']"
"According to the contested decision, the measure in question (a) was merely a limited reduction in the rate of the levy (approximately 6%) and did not strengthen the financial situation of a monopoly undertaking, (b) was ongoing in character and (c) was not aimed at financing an ad hoc operation but at 'increasing the resources of the recipients of the non-public levies' (see paragraph 51).",0,"[' accord decision', 'number do strengthen situation', ' finance operation', ' increase resource', ' see paragraph']"
"The Court held that the three criteria, as applied in this instance, were not such as to justify the finding by the Commission that the reduction in the levy rate was not State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty but should be classed I-3319 JUDGMENT OF 16.",0,"['court hold ', ' apply instance', ' to justify finding', 'reduction should be class judgment']"

"Second, with regard to the cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer payment of certain betting levies, the Court of First Instance found that the mere fact that the measure in question belonged to a separate system intended to apply solely to the sector concerned, and did not fall within the derogations from the general fiscal arrangements, did not remove it from the ambit of Article 92(1) of the Treaty (paragraphs 74 to 77).",0,"[' enable pmu', ' to defer payment', 'court find ', 'measure belong system', ' to apply company', 'number do fall derogation', 'fact do remove it', 'fact do remove ambit', 'number do remove it', 'number do remove ambit']"
"The Court declared that any State measure, whether permanent or temporary, which has the effect of granting financial advantages to an undertaking and improving its financial position falls within the definition of State aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty and, accordingly, the question whether a change in the rules for allocation of the levies is temporary or permanent is not an adequate test for determining whether that provision applies in a particular case (paragraph 78).",0,"['court declare ', 'which have effect', ' grant advantage', ' improve position', 'measure fall definition', 'provision apply case']"
"As for the fact that the change in the rules concerning payment to the Treasury of the public levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a general amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector, the Court observed that, contrary to the Commission's assertion, there was no statement to that effect in the contested decision, according to which the Minister for the Budget had allowed the payments due to the Treasury to be deferred solely in the case of the PMU.",0,"[' cerne payment', 'court observe ', 'there be statement', 'minister have allow ', 'payment to be defer case']"
"The fact that, as a general rule, the operation of the pari mutuel in France could benefit not only members of the PMU but also, indirectly, non- member companies, could not be regarded as decisive (paragraph 79).",0,['fact be regard paragraph']
"I - 3320 FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 10 With respect to the Commission's argument that the State intervention in question was made in the context of the exceptionally heavy taxation of the horse-racing sector, which was considerably higher than in other sectors, the Court found that that argument, put forward for the first time before it and unsupported by adequate evidence, was not sufficient in itself to show that the Commission's view was well founded (paragraph 81).",0,"['intervention be make text', 'court find ', ' put time']"
"1 Third, with regard to the PMU's access to unclaimed winnings, the Court of First- Instance held that resources of that kind could not be regarded as 'normal resources' belonging to the racecourse undertakings and the PMU, but- constituted 'State resources', the allocation of which to the Treasury depended on whether certain statutory conditions were met (paragraphs 105 to 108).",0,"['court hold ', 'resource be regard resource', ' belong undertaking', 'court stitute resource', 'allocation depend ', 'dition be meet paragraph']"

"2 Consequently, the Commission's finding that although the measure in question was designed to finance social expenditure of the racecourse undertakings linked to the organisation of totalisator betting it did not constitute State aid because no transfer of State resources was involved was based on false premisses (paragraph 111).",0,"['measure be design ', ' to finance expenditure', ' link organisation', 'transfer be involve ', 'finding be base paragraph']"
"3 Fourth, so far as concerns the exemption from the one-month delay rule for VAT deductions as from 1 January 1989, the Court of First Instance found that it was clear from the file that, as conceded by the Commission at the hearing, the permanent deposit with the French Treasury which the racecourse undertakings had been required to lodge in return for the exemption granted to them on 1 August 1969 had existed not since 1989 but since 1969, and that the contested decision was therefore vitiated on that point by a manifest error (paragraphs 118 and 119).",0,"['company cern exemption', 'court find ', ' cede commission', ' cede hearing', 'undertaking have be require ', ' to lodge return', ' grant august', 'deposit have exist number', 'deposit have exist 1989', 'decision be vitiate point', 'decision be vitiate error']"

"Since the Commission's assessment of the measure in question was in any event vitiated by error, the Court held that the applicant's claims had to be upheld and that the contested decision had to be annulled in that regard (paragraphs 120, 121 and 122).",0,"['assessment be vitiate error', 'court hold ', 'claim have ', 'decision have ', ' to be annul regard', ' to be annul paragraph']"
"Finally, with regard to the obligation to recover aid incompatible with the common market, the Court of First Instance considered whether the Commission, when it adopts a decision instructing the Member State concerned to recover such aid, may restrict the effects in time of that decision on the ground that the Member State considers that a judgment delivered by a domestic court was liable to give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the recipient of the aid that the latter was lawful (paragraph 180).",0,"[' to recover aid', 'company sidere ', 'it adopt decision', ' instruct company', ' to recover aid', 'commission may restrict effect', 'commission may restrict time', 'commission may restrict decision', 'commission may restrict ground', 'company sider ', ' deliver company', ' deliver rt', ' to give rise', ' to give expectation']"
"After reviewing the relevant case-law, the Court held that it is not for the Member State concerned, but for the recipient undertaking, in the context of proceedings before the public authorities or before the national courts, to plead exceptional circumstances on the basis of which it had entertained legitimate expectations, justifying refusal to repay unlawful aid (paragraphs 179 to 184).",0,"[' review law', 'court hold ', 'company cerne ', ' undertake text', ' to plead circumstance', 'it have entertain expectation', ' justify refusal', ' justify paragraph', ' to repay aid']"
"Accordingly, in so far as the contested decision limited the temporal scope of the French authorities' obligation to require repayment of aid not to the period commencing in 1989 (the date from which it was declared incompatible), but to the period commencing with the opening of the procedure on 11 January 1991, it was vitiated by infringement of Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty (now Article 88(2) EC) (paragraph 185).",0,"['decision limit scope', ' to require repayment', ' mence 1989', 'it be declare incompatible', ' mence opening', 'it be vitiate infringement']"

"1 In the first part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the Court of First Instance made several errors of law in holding that the three criteria relied on by the Commission in declining to categorise the measure concerning the reduction in the public levies for the benefit of the PMU as State aid were not an appropriate basis for ruling out the existence of aid for the purposes of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",1,"['company tend ', 'court make error', ' rely commission', ' to categorise company', ' cerne reduction', ' cerne aid', ' rule existence', ' rule purpose']"
"I - 3324 FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION 22 The appellant maintains, first of all, that in reaching that conclusion the Court of First Instance gave insufficient grounds, contrary to Article 190 of the EC Treaty (now Article 253 EC), for certain steps in its reasoning, that it failed to adopt a position with regard to certain crucial factors relied on both by the Commission, in the contested decision and in its pleadings before the Court of First Instance, and by the appellant itself, in its statement in intervention, and that it based part of its reasoning on false premisses.",1,"['appellant maintain ', ' reach clusion', 'court give ground', 'it fail ', ' to adopt position', ' rely commission', 'it base part', 'it base premiss']"
It should be noted at the outset that the appellant's argument relates to the nature and scope of review of the Commission's assessment as to whether a measure adopted by national authorities is to be categorised as State aid.,1,"['argument relate nature', ' adopt authority', ' to be categorise aid']"
"According to the appellant, the particular nature of the review of State aid means that, when the court carrying out the review is called on to assess the facts of the case in the light of legal criteria, it must limit itself to satisfying itself that there is no manifest error of assessment.",1,"[' accord appellant', 'nature mean ', ' carry review', ' to assess fact', ' to assess light', 'it must limit itself', ' satisfy itself', 'there be error']"
"That form of review cannot be reserved for special circumstances, whose existence is in any event often difficult to ascertain.",1,['form can be not reserve circumstance']
"Consequently, the Court of First Instance erred in law in its definition of the nature of the review which it was to carry out in that it stated, in essence, that in the absence of special circumstances, arising in particular from the complex nature of the State intervention in question, review by it is not to be confined to determining whether there has been a manifest error of assessment as to whether aid is involved.",1,"['court err law', 'court err definition', 'it state essence', ' arise nature', 'aid be involve ']"
"The short answer to that is that State aid, as defined in the Treaty, is a legal concept which must be interpreted on the basis of objective factors.",1,"[' define treaty', 'which must be interpret basis']"
"For that reason, the Community courts must in principle, having regard both to the specific features of the case before them and to the technical or complex nature of the Commission's assessments, carry out a comprehensive review as to whether a measure falls within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",1,"[' have regard', 'rt must carry review', 'measure fall scope']"
Instance therefore did not err in law so far as concerns the scope of judicial review of the Commission's assessments.,1,"['instance do number', 'company cern scope']"
"Second, the appellant alleges that, in its review of the present case, the Court of First Instance incorrectly assessed the arguments relied on by the Commission when finding that the measure reducing the public levies was not caught by Article 92(1).",1,"['appellant allege ', 'court assess argument', ' rely commission', ' reduce levy', ' catch article']"
"The appellant maintains that the Court of First Instance wrongly failed to verify whether the criteria adopted by the Commission were justified, as stated in the contested decision, by the nature and scheme of the particular system at issue, whose existence the Court of First Instance indeed acknowledged.",1,"['appellant maintain ', 'court fail ', ' adopt commission', 'criterion be justify nature', ' state decision', 'court acknowledge ']"
"It accordingly erred in law, decisively affecting the outcome of the case.",1,"['it err law', ' affect outcome']"
"The appellant argues that, in the context of regimes applicable to the economy as a whole, consideration of the compatibility of particular measures with Article 92(1) of the Treaty by reason of the nature and scheme of the system of which they form part is essential where the issue is one of distinguishing mechanisms which may constitute State aid from others which are not caught by Article 92(1) precisely because they are justified by the nature and scheme of the system.",1,"['appellant argue ', 'they form part', ' distinguish mechanism', 'which may stitute aid', 'which may stitute other', 'which be catch article', 'they be justify nature']"
The Court of First Instance could therefore not avoid consideration of whether there was such a justification here before categorising the measure at issue as aid.,1,"[' avoid sideration', 'there be justification', ' categorise measure', ' categorise aid']"
"As to that, it is clear from paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance not only was aware of the specific nature of the tax regime applicable to horse-race betting in France but also took account of it.",1,"['number take account', 'number take it']"
"Furthermore, the appellant's reasoning is founded on an incorrect analysis of the contested decision.",1,['reasoning be found analysis']
"As the Advocate General states in points 25 and 26 of his Opinion, the Commission did not rely, a priori and in vague terms, on the particular nature of the French system of fiscal levies on horse-race betting in order to decide that the reduction in the public levies was not State aid.",1,"['general state point', 'commission do rely term', 'commission do rely nature']"
"On the contrary, it applied three criteria of interpretation from which it derived the three propositions set out in paragraph 5 of this judgment, in order to reach the conclusion that that reduction amounted not to State aid but to 'a reform in the form of a ""tax"" adjustment that is justified by the nature and economy of the system in question'.",1,"['it apply criterion', 'it derive proposition', ' set paragraph', ' to reach clusion', 'reduction amount aid', 'that be justify nature']"
There is thus no substance to the proposition that the criterion relating to the nature and scheme of the system is independent of the other three criteria or constitutes the legal basis of the Commission's assessment.,1,"['there be substance', ' relate nature', 'company stitute basis']"
"It follows that the Court of First Instance neither misconstrued nor refused to take account of the criterion of the nature and scheme of the system when it considered whether, having regard to the facts of the case, the Commission was entitled to find that the measure reducing the public levies did not fall within the scope of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",1,"['it follow ', ' misconstrue number', 'court refuse ', ' to take account', ' to take criterion', 'it sidere ', ' have regard', 'commission be entitle ', ' reduce levy', 'measure do fall scope']"
"Third, the French Government alleges that the Court of First Instance erred with regard to the legal characterisation of the facts by implicitly holding that the Commission could not infer from the fact that a specific operation was not financed and from the limited change in the public levies that the reduction in the rate of levy of 1.6% for the benefit of the PMU was consistent with the nature and scheme of the system and did not amount to aid within the meaning of Article 92(1).",1,"['government allege ', 'court err regard', 'number infer fact', 'operation be finance ']"
"It should be noted that in paragraphs 57, 58 and 59 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance queried the validity of those two criteria adopted by the Commission, but it found in any event that the change in the rate of the public I - 3327 JUDGMENT OF 16.",1,"['court query validity', ' adopt commission', 'it find event']"
0 — CASE C-83/98 P levies was designed to finance a specific operation and that the reduction in the rate of levy was not limited in nature.,1,"['levy be design ', ' to finance operation', ' limit nature']"
"In those circumstances, it is unnecessary for the Court to establish whether the Court of First Instance was wrong to find that the Commission was not entitled to have recourse to those criteria in order to determine whether the fiscal measure at issue constituted State aid.",1,"['court to establish ', ' to have recourse', 'measure stitute aid']"
"In addition, the arguments relied on by the appellant to contest the findings of the Court of First Instance referred to in paragraph 32 of this judgment effectively dispute the Court's assessment of the facts, a matter not open to challenge on appeal.",1,"[' rely appellant', ' to test finding', ' refer paragraph', 'argument dispute assessment']"
Those arguments must therefore be rejected as inadmissible.,1,['argument must be reject ']
The final argument in the first part of the first ground of appeal consists in the assertion that a contradiction is apparent in the grounds of the judgment under appeal.,1,['argument sist assertion']
"The appellant refers in particular to paragraph 154 of the judgment, where the Court of First Instance stated that 'it is apparent from the contested decision that before the PMI was set up in January 1989 there was no trade between France and the other Member States, which means that before that date there was not even competition between the PMU and the other economic operators active on the Community market in bet-taking'.",1,"['appellant refer paragraph', 'court state ', 'pmi be set january', 'there be trade', 'which mean ', 'there be petition']"
"According to the appellant, on the very wording of Article 92(1) of the Treaty that statement should have led the Court of First Instance to find that no measure implemented for the benefit of the PMU before 1989, nor in particular adjustments to the public levies as from 1985 — at least so far as concerns their effects until the end of 1988 — could constitute State aid caught by that provision.",1,"[' accord appellant', 'statement should have lead court', ' to find measure', ' implement benefit', ' implement 1989', 'company cern effect', ' catch provision']"
That proposition cannot be accepted.,1,['proposition can be not accept ']
It is apparent from paragraphs 51 to 62 of the judgment under appeal that the Court of First Instance merely determined whether the three criteria referred to in the contested decision concerning the I - 3328 FRANCE V LADBROKE RACING AND COMMISSION change in the public levies were sufficient to justify the finding that that change amounted to a reform in the form of a tax adjustment that was justified by the nature and scheme of the system in question.,1,"['court determine ', ' refer company', ' cerne change', ' to justify finding', 'change amount reform', 'that be justify nature']"
"On the other hand, the Court of First Instance did not rule on the remaining criteria for application of Article 92(1) of the Treaty, in particular on the question whether competition in the Community betting market was affected by that adjustment of the public levies.",1,"['court do rule criterion', 'petition be affect adjustment']"
There can thus be no contradiction between the conclusion set out in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal and the statements contained in paragraph 154 thereof.,1,"[' set paragraph', 'company taine paragraph']"
The same considerations hold good for the other State measures examined by the Court of First Instance.,1,"['sideration hold good', ' examine court']"
The first part of the first ground of appeal must accordingly be rejected.,1,['part must be reject ']
"In the second part of the first ground of appeal, the French Republic criticises the judgment under appeal in so far as the Court of First Instance held that the Commission had misapplied Article 92(1) of the Treaty when it found that the cash-flow facilities enabling the PMU to defer the payment of certain betting levies did not constitute State aid.",1,"['republic criticise judgment', 'court hold ', 'commission have misapply article', 'it find aid', ' enable pmu', ' to defer payment']"
"It should be noted at the outset that the appellant repeats in part the objections raised in the first part of this ground of appeal, relating to the scope of judicial review and the alleged failure of the Court of First Instance to take account of the particular nature of the system of levies on horse-race betting in France and the way in which it is organised.",1,"['appellant repeat objection', 'appellant repeat part', ' raise part', ' relate scope', ' to take account', ' to take nature', 'it be organise ']"

I - 3329 JUDGMENT OF 16.,1,[]
"0 — CASE C-83/98 P 42 Next, the appellant criticises the Court of First Instance for finding, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision contains no statement to the effect that the change in the rules concerning payment to the Treasury of the betting levies did not constitute an ad hoc derogation but was a general amendment to the tax regime for the entire horse-racing sector and not only for the PMU.",1,"['appellant criticise court', ' find paragraph', 'company test tains', 'company test effect', ' cerne payment', 'change do stitute derogation', 'company do stitute derogation']"
"Finally, the appellant alleges that, contrary to the statement made by the Court of First Instance in paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission did indeed set out in the contested decision evidence showing that the State intervention in question was made in the context of exceptionally heavy taxation of the horse-racing sector, which is significantly higher than in other sectors.",1,"['appellant allege ', ' make court', ' make paragraph', 'commission do set evidence', 'commission do set decision', 'intervention be make text', 'intervention be make taxation']"
"In that regard, suffice it to state, as the Advocate General has done in points 37 and 39 of his Opinion, that those arguments relate to the Court of First Instance's assessment of the facts, which cannot be challenged before the Court of Justice on appeal.",1,"[' suffice it', 'general have do point', 'argument relate assessment', 'which can be not challenge court', 'which can be not challenge appeal']"
"Consequently, the second part of the first ground of appeal must be rejected.",1,['part must be reject ']
"In the third part of the first ground of appeal, the appellant contends that the Court of First Instance erred in law by holding, in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission's finding that the PMU's access to winnings unclaimed by bettors, while designed to finance social expenditure of the racecourse undertakings, did not constitute State aid because no transfer of State resources was involved was based on false premisses and for that reason had to be annulled.",1,"['company tend ', 'court err law', ' hold paragraph', ' to finance expenditure', ' do stitute aid', 'transfer be involve ', ' be base premiss']"
"According to the appellant, the judgment under appeal should be set aside in that respect since, having regard to the nature and scheme of the system in question, the funds retained by the PMU after payment of winnings to bettors and of the public levies constitute normal resources.",1,"[' accord appellant', 'judgment should be set respect', ' have regard', ' retain pmu', ' retain payment', 'fund stitute resource']"
The mere fact that at a given moment the State restricts use of part of those resources to particular objectives cannot transform their nature and convert them into State resources.,1,"['state restrict use', 'state restrict objective', 'fact can not transform nature', 'fact can not transform resource', 'fact vert they']"
"In that regard, it is to be noted that in paragraphs 105 to 108 of the judgment under appeal the Court of First Instance explains its assessment concerning the categorisation of the national measure in question as State aid.",1,"['court explain company', ' cerne categorisation']"
"As the Advocate General states in point 42 of his Opinion, that assessment leaves no room for criticism of its legal correctness.",1,"['general state point', 'assessment leave room']"
It is clear from those paragraphs of the judgment under appeal that the measure enables the racecourse undertakings to cover certain social expenditure of the PMU and that the amount of the sums corresponding to the unclaimed winnings is monitored by the competent French authorities.,1,"['measure enable undertaking', ' respond winning', 'amount be monitor authority']"
"The Court of First Instance inferred therefrom in paragraph 109 that, inasmuch as national legislation extended the range of uses to which those sums may be put to activities of the racecourse undertakings other than those initially envisaged, the national legislature, by virtue of that extension, in effect waived revenue which in principle should have been paid over to the Treasury.",1,"['court infer paragraph', 'legislation extend range', 'sum may be put activity', 'legislature waive revenue', 'which should have be pay treasury']"
"The Court of First Instance added in paragraph 110 that in so far as those resources had been used 'to finance social expenditure, in particular', as stated in the contested decision, it was settled case-law that they constituted a reduction in the social security commitments which an undertaking normally had to discharge, and thus constituted aid to it.",1,"['court add paragraph', 'resource have be use ', ' to finance expenditure', ' state decision', 'it be settle law', 'company stitute reduction', 'number have ', 'company stitute aid', 'company stitute it']"

"Consequently, even though the sums involved in the measure allowing the PMU access to unclaimed winnings are not permanently held by the Treasury, the fact that they constantly remain under public control, and therefore available to the competent national authorities, is sufficient for them to be categorised as State aid and for the measure to fall within Article 92(1) of the Treaty.",1,"[' involve measure', ' allow access', 'sum be hold treasury', 'company remain trol', 'they to be categorise aid', 'measure to fall article']"
