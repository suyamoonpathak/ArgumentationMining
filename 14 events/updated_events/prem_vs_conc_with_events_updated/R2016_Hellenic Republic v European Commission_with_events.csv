"With regard to the first part of the first ground of appeal, it should be recalled, in the first place, as regards the argument that the General Court distorted the facts, that it follows from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to find the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents in the file submitted to it, and, second, to assess those facts (judgments in General Motors v Commission, C‑551/03 P, EU:C:2006:229, paragraph 51, and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta v Commission, C‑352/09 P, EU:C:2011:191, paragraph 179).",prem,"['it should be recall place', ' regard argument', 'court distort fact', 'it follow subparagraph', ' have to find fact', ' to assess judgment']"
"Therefore, the appraisal of the facts by the General Court does not constitute, save where the clear sense of the evidence produced before it is distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (judgments in Archer Daniels Midland and Archer Daniels Midland Ingredients v Commission, C‑397/03 P, EU:C:2006:328, paragraph 85, and ThyssenKrupp Nirosta v Commission, C‑352/09 P, EU:C:2011:191, paragraph 180).",prem,"[' produce it', 'sense be distort ']"
"Where an appellant alleges distortion of the evidence by the General Court, he must, under Article 256 TFEU, the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to such distortion.",prem,"['appellant allege distortion', 'he must indicate evidence', ' to have be distort court', 'he show error', 'which lead distortion']"
"In addition, it is settled case-law of the Court that distortion must be obvious from the documents in the Court’s file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (judgments in Lafarge v Commission, C‑413/08 P, EU:C:2010:346, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited, and Austria v Scheucher-Fleisch and Others, C‑47/10 P, EU:C:2011:698, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it be settle law', ' to carry assessment', ' to carry lafarge']"
"In the present case, the General Court found as follows in paragraphs 122 to 128 and 130 to 132 of the judgment under appeal:",prem,['court find paragraph']
"The Commission recalled in the contested decision, that the Court had already held in the judgment in Freskot [(C‑355/00, EU:C:2003:298)] that “the national legislation at issue clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law (see, in particular, France v Commission, [C‑482/99, EU:C:2002:294], paragraph 24)” (recital 58).",prem,"['commission recall decision', 'court have hold judgment', 'legislation establish ', ' provide elga', 'benefit be grant resource']"
"The Commission found that:

“... under Article 5(a) of Law … 1790/1988 ... and other provisions of Greek legislation in force, ELGA’s income from the special contribution was collected by the tax authorities, entered in the State budget as State revenue and paid to ELGA from the budget of the Ministry of Agriculture (now the Ministry of Rural Development and Food).",prem,"['commission find ', 'income be lecte authority', 'income enter budget', 'income enter revenue', ' pay budget']"
"Consequently, the fact that the contributions in question are entered into the accounts as State revenue is sufficient to consider that the payments made by ELGA were financed by State resources” (recital 58).",prem,"['tribution be enter account', 'tribution be enter revenue', ' make elga', 'payment be finance recital']"
"Those findings, which are not disputed by the Hellenic Republic, suffice to conclude that the compensation payments that correspond to the contributions by farmers are State resources and are imputable to the State.",prem,"[' dispute republic', 'finding suffice clude', 'company respond tribution']"
"Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the part of the payments corresponding to the contributions by farmers may not be regarded as being private funds.",prem,"['republic claim ', ' respond tribution', 'part may be regard ', 'number may be regard ']"
"Accordingly, the fact that a part of the payments made in 2008 was financed by contributions by farmers does not preclude these being State aid financed by resources imputable to the State.",prem,"[' make 2008', 'part be finance tribution', 'fact do preclude ', ' finance resource']"
"Moreover, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the classification as State aid does not apply to the contributions paid by farmers but to the payments made in 2008.",prem,"['republic claim ', 'classification do apply tribution', ' pay farmer', ' make 2008']"
"In that regard, it must be recalled that it has been held in the context of the first and second pleas in law that neither the compensatory nature of the measures, nor the fact that they are justified by a social objective, precludes the payments made by ELGA being classified as an advantage.",prem,"['it must be recall ', 'it have be hold text', 'they be justify objective', ' make elga', 'payment be classify advantage']"
"Furthermore, the Hellenic Republic concedes that the contributions paid by farmers are not proportionate to risk and that it is possible that certain farmers pay a contribution without receiving compensation payments from ELGA.",prem,"['company cede ', ' pay farmer', 'farmer pay tribution', ' receive payment', ' receive elga']"
The payments made in 2008 were therefore independent of the contributions paid by the farmers and constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions.,prem,"[' make 2008', ' pay farmer', 'payment stitute advantage', ' undertake number', 'beneficiary have obtain dition']"
"It follows from the foregoing that the Commission was fully entitled to find that the payments made by ELGA in 2008 were advantages financed by State resources, even if they were financed in part by contributions by farmers.",prem,"['it follow forego', 'commission be entitle ', ' make elga', ' make 2008', ' finance resource', 'they be finance tribution', 'they be finance farmer']"
The Hellenic Republic has not shown that the Commission erred in classifying those payments as State aid.,prem,"['republic have show ', 'commission err ', ' classify payment', ' classify aid']"
"The contested decision states that the compensation payments made by ELGA in 2009, of EUR 415019452 in total, were made on the basis of the Inter-ministerial decree.",prem,"['decision state ', ' make elga', ' make 2009', 'payment be make basis']"
"The Inter-ministerial decree provided for compensation of EUR 425 million, on an exceptional basis, for damage in 2008 and stated that, for the purpose of paying that compensation, ELGA would take out a loan, guaranteed by the State, with a bank, for the total amount ...",prem,"['decree provide pensation', 'decree provide basis', 'decree provide damage', 'decree provide 2008', 'decree state ', ' pay pensation', 'elga would take loan', ' guarantee state']"
It follows that the Commission was correct in finding that the compensation payments made in 2009 were not financed by the contributions paid under the ELGA compulsory insurance scheme ... .,prem,"['it follow ', ' make 2009', 'payment be finance tribution', ' pay scheme']"
"Therefore, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the contributions paid by farmers in 2009 under the compulsory insurance scheme may not be regarded as financing part of the aid paid in 2009.’",prem,"['republic claim ', ' pay farmer', ' pay 2009', ' pay scheme', 'tribution may be regard part', 'number may be regard part', ' pay 2009']"
"In the light of the General Court’s findings set out above, the argument alleging distortion of the facts must be rejected at the outset, since, by its line of argument, the Hellenic Republic has not shown that the General Court distorted the facts in a manner obvious from the documents in the file.",prem,"[' allege distortion', 'argument must be reject outset', 'republic have show ', 'court distort fact', 'court distort manner']"
"In the second place, with regard to the argument that the General Court described the facts incorrectly, it should be stated that, having first of all pointed out, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the classification as State aid did not apply to the special insurance contribution paid by farmers but to the payment of compensation aid by ELGA;",prem,"['court describe fact', 'it should be state ', ' having point paragraph', 'classification do number ', ' apply tribution', ' pay farmer']"
"having then found, in paragraph 127 of that judgment, that the payments made in 2008 were independent of those contributions;",prem,"[' having find paragraph', ' make 2008']"
"and, lastly, having pointed out, in paragraphs 130 to 132 of that judgment, that the payments made in 2009 were financed not by the contributions but by means of a loan, guaranteed by the State, taken out to that end with a bank,",prem,"[' having point paragraph', ' make 2009', 'payment be finance tribution', ' guarantee state', ' take end', ' take bank']"
"the General Court was entitled to conclude, without erring in law, that those payments were advantages financed by State resources.",prem,"['court be entitle ', ' err law', ' finance resource']"
"Nor did the General Court err in law, in the third place, in relying, in paragraph 122 of the judgment under appeal, on paragraph 81 of the judgment in Freskot (C‑355/00, EU:C:2003:298), since the Court held in that paragraph, with regard to a previous version of Article 5a of Law 1790/1988 but a version in essence identical to that applicable to the present dispute, that that legislation ‘clearly establishe[d] that the benefits provided by ELGA [were] granted through State resources and [were] imputable to the State within the meaning of the Court’s case-law’.",prem,"['court do err law', 'court do err place', ' rely paragraph', ' rely paragraph', 'court hold paragraph', 'court hold regard', 'legislation establish ', ' provide elga', 'benefit be grant resource']"
"Moreover, it should be pointed out that the Hellenic Republic does not dispute that the contributions to the special insurance contribution, in so far as they were collected by the tax authorities, were included in the State budget.",prem,"['it should be point ', 'republic do dispute ', 'they be lecte authority', 'tribution be include budget']"
"As regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, it must be recalled that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the duty incumbent upon the General Court under Article 36 and the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.",prem,"[' regard part', 'it must be recall ', ' accord law', ' to state reason', 'duty do require court', ' to provide account', 'that follow ', ' articulate party']"
"The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to understand the grounds of the General Court’s judgment and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient information to exercise its powers of review on appeal (see, inter alia, judgment in A2A v Commission, C‑320/09 P, EU:C:2011:858, paragraph 97).",prem,"['it enable person', ' to understand ground', 'it provide court', 'it provide information', ' to exercise power', ' to exercise appeal']"
"In the present case, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court pointed out that, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claimed, the classification as State aid did not apply to the contributions paid by farmers but to the payments made in 2008 by ELGA.",prem,"['court point ', 'republic claim ', 'classification do apply tribution', ' pay farmer', ' make 2008', ' make elga']"
"Furthermore, in that same paragraph, the General Court referred to its findings made in the context of the examination of the first and second pleas in law in the action for annulment.",prem,"['court refer finding', ' make text']"
"In the context of that examination, the General Court stated, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, ‘that the fact that the payments made by ELGA in 2009 were intended to compensate for damage caused to agricultural production because of adverse weather conditions d[id] not preclude the existence of an advantage and the classification as State aid’ and, in paragraph 102 of that judgment, ‘that, according to settled case-law, competition is distorted where a measure mitigates the burden imposed on a beneficiary undertaking and thereby strengthens its position as regards competing undertakings’.",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'court state paragraph', ' make elga', ' make 2009', 'payment be intend ', ' to pensate damage', ' cause production', ' cause dition', 'fact preclude existence', ' accord law', 'petition be distort ', 'measure mitigate burden', ' impose undertaking', 'measure strengthen position', ' regard undertaking']"
"In those circumstances, it must be held that the statement of reasons in the judgment under appeal meets the requirements referred to in paragraph 38 of this judgment.",prem,"['it must be hold ', 'statement meet requirement', ' refer paragraph']"
"Moreover, having found that the payments of compensation aid made in 2008 and 2009 were independent of the contributions paid by the farmers, the General Court was entitled to conclude, without erring in law, that those payments constituted an advantage that the beneficiary undertaking could not have obtained under normal market conditions, and therefore affected competition.",prem,"[' make 2008', ' pay farmer', 'court be entitle clude', ' err law', 'company stitute advantage', ' undertake number', 'beneficiary have obtain dition', 'company affect petition']"
"In view of the independence of the contributions paid by the farmers in relation to the compensation aid received by them, those contributions cannot be regarded as specific charges imposed on the advantage consisting, in the present case, of the payment of that aid;",prem,"[' pay farmer', ' pay relation', ' receive they', 'tribution can be not regard charge', ' impose company', ' siste case', ' siste payment']"
nor can those contributions be regarded as connected with the introduction of that advantage.,prem,"['tribution can be regard company', ' necte introduction']"
"Accordingly, the General Court was fully entitled to conclude that, in the present case, the Commission was justified, under Article 107(1) TFEU, in refusing to offset the advantage and those same contributions (see, to that effect, judgment in France Télécom v Commission, C‑81/10 P, EU:C:2011:811, paragraphs 43 and 48).",prem,"[' to offset advantage', 'tribution see judgment', 'tribution see effect']"
"The documents of the proceedings at first instance show that the argument put forward by the Hellenic Republic before the Court to the effect that the settled case-law of the Court relating to the concept of State aid, referred to in paragraph 45 of this judgment, is inapplicable to the present case because of the exceptional economic conditions experienced by the Hellenic Republic in 2009, was not put forward before the General Court.",prem,"['document show ', ' put republic', ' put court', ' put effect', ' relate cept', ' experience republic', ' experience 2009', ' put court']"
"At first instance, the Hellenic Republic complained that the Commission did not adequately explain, in the decision at issue, in what respect the compensation payments had conferred on the farmers concerned a competitive advantage affecting trade between Member States, and could, therefore, be classified as State aid, notwithstanding the serious crisis affecting the Greek economy at that time.",prem,"['company plain ', 'commission do explain decision', 'payment have ferre advantage', 'company have ferre advantage', ' affect trade', 'ld be classify aid', 'number withstand crisis', ' affect economy', ' affect time']"
"However, in raising such an argument, the Hellenic Republic cannot be regarded as having set out a complaint other than one alleging that the decision at issue failed to state reasons.",prem,"[' raise argument', 'republic can be not regard ', ' having set plaint', 'decision fail ']"
"Therefore, the argument that the General Court infringed Article 107(1) TFEU by failing to find — in the context of the serious crisis affecting the Greek economy in 2009 — that the payment of compensation aid neither conferred any competitive advantage on the farmers concerned nor affected trade between Member States, is new in character.",prem,"['court infringe tfeu', ' to find text', ' affect economy', ' affect 2009', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre trade']"
"Consequently, that argument must be rejected as inadmissible.",prem,['argument must be reject ']
"According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court, would in effect allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice a wider case than that heard by the General Court (see, to that effect, judgments in Alliance One International and Standard Commercial Tobacco v Commission and Commission v Alliance One International and Others, C‑628/10 P and C‑14/11 P, EU:C:2012:479, paragraph 111, and Groupe Gascogne v Commission, C‑58/12 P, EU:C:2013:770, paragraph 35).",prem,"[' accord law', 'party to put plea', 'party to put time', 'party to put court', 'it have ', 'number raise court', 'allow would allow ', 'party to bring case', 'party to bring court', ' hear court', ' see judgment', ' see effect']"
"It follows that the second ground of appeal is admissible only in so far as, by that ground, the Hellenic Republic in essence complains that the General Court did not respond to the complaint that the decision at issue was inadequately reasoned.",prem,"['it follow ', 'court do respond plaint', 'decision be reason ']"
"As stated in paragraph 38 of this judgment, the duty incumbent upon the General Court to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.",prem,"[' state paragraph', ' to state reason', 'duty do require court', ' to provide account', 'that follow argument', ' articulate party']"
"The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to understand the grounds of the General Court’s judgment and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient information to exercise its powers of review on appeal (judgment in Isdin v Bial-Portela, C‑597/12 P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 21).",prem,"['it enable person', ' to understand ground', 'it provide court', 'it provide information', ' to exercise power', ' to exercise judgment']"
"It has already been held in paragraph 41 of this judgment that the statement of reasons in the judgment under appeal enabled the parties, and the Hellenic Republic in particular, to understand the grounds on which the General Court found that there was an economic advantage liable to distort competition.",prem,"['it have be hold paragraph', 'statement enable party', ' to understand ground', 'court find ', 'there be advantage', ' to distort petition']"
"It should be added that, in its response to the complaint that the statement of reasons concerning the condition as to there being an adverse effect on competition and an effect on trade was inadequate, the General Court stated, in paragraph 108 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘the economic crisis in the European Union from 2008 does not constitute a circumstance that is capable of calling in question the fact that the agricultural sector is exposed to strong competition within the European Union’ and that ‘the Commission has moreover adopted specific rules aimed at authorising certain State aid during the economic crisis, in particular, the [TCF], which precluded aid granted in the primary agricultural sector being declared compatible with the internal market’.",prem,"['it should be add ', 'company cerne dition', 'court state paragraph', 'crisis do number stitute', 'crisis do number circumstance', ' call fact', ' call question', 'sector be expose petition', 'commission have adopt rule', ' authorise aid', ' authorise crisis', 'which preclude ', ' grant sector', 'aid be declare company']"
"As regards the admissibility of the first part of the third ground of appeal, the documents of the proceedings at first instance show that, in support of the fourth plea in law in the action for annulment, by which the Hellenic Republic complained that the Commission misused its discretion and misinterpreted and misapplied Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, the Hellenic Republic put forward evidence, which — in its view — was such as to establish, inter alia, the existence of a very serious disturbance in the Greek economy as a whole in 2009.",prem,"[' regard admissibility', 'document show ', 'company plain ', 'commission misuse discretion', 'commission misinterpret ', ' misapply tfeu', 'republic put evidence', ' to establish existence']"
"Consequently, as the Advocate General observed in points 32 and 34 of her Opinion, even if it is apparent from paragraphs 185 to 188 of the judgment under appeal that, in its response to the fourth plea in law in the action for annulment, the General Court did not rule on the existence in 2009 of a very serious disturbance in the Greek economy, the Hellenic Republic is entitled to claim before the Court that the General Court erred in law in rejecting its argument that such a disturbance justified the application of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU to the facts of the present case.",prem,"['general observe point', 'court do rule existence', 'republic be entitle ', ' to claim court', 'court err law', ' reject argument', 'disturbance justify application']"
"As regards the substance, the General Court held as follows in paragraphs 185 to 188 of the judgment under appeal:",prem,"[' regard substance', 'court hold paragraph']"
"With regard to the arguments raised in the fourth plea, it is clear that, contrary to what the Hellenic Republic claims, the Commission had to base its decision on the [TCF] and not directly apply Article 107(3)(b) TFEU in order to assess the compatibility of the payments made by ELGA in 2009 on account of the economic crisis experienced in Greece.",prem,"[' raise plea', 'republic claim ', 'commission have ', ' to base decision', ' to base tcf', ' apply tfeu', ' to assess patibility', ' make elga', ' make 2009', ' make account', ' experience greece']"
"It is clear from the case-law that, in adopting rules of conduct and announcing by publishing them that they will henceforth apply to the cases to which they relate, the Commission imposes a limit on the exercise of its aforementioned discretion and cannot depart from those rules without being found, where appropriate, to be in breach of general principles of law, such as equal treatment or the protection of legitimate expectations (see judgment[s] in Germany and Others v Kronofrance, [C‑75/05 P and C‑80/05 P, EU:C:2008:482], paragraph 60 and the case-law cited, and … Holland Malt v Commission, C‑464/09 P, [EU:C:2010:733], paragraph 46).",prem,"[' adopt rule', ' publish they', 'they will apply case', 'they relate ', 'commission impose limit', 'commission impose exercise', 'commission can not depart rule', ' see judgment']"
"Accordingly, in the specific area of State aid, the Commission is bound by the guidelines and notices that it issues, to the extent that they do not depart from the rules in the Treaty (see judgment in Holland Malt v Commission, [C‑464/09 P, EU:C:2010:733], paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['commission be bind guideline', 'commission be bind extent', 'it issue ', 'they do depart rule', ' see judgment']"
"Therefore, it is necessary to reject the arguments of the Hellenic Republic to the effect that, on account of the serious disturbance in the Greek economy due to the economic crisis experienced in Greece since the end of 2008 and in 2009, the Commission should have declared the payments made by ELGA in 2009 compatible directly on the basis of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU.’",prem,"[' to reject argument', ' experience greece', ' experience end', 'commission should have declare patible', 'commission should have declare basis', ' make elga', ' make 2009']"
"Under Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, ‘the following may be considered to be compatible with the internal market: … aid … to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State’.",prem,"['follow may be sidere ', ' to remedy disturbance']"
"As the General Court stated in paragraphs 159 to 161 of the judgment under appeal, it is settled case-law of the Court that, in the application of Article 107(3) TFEU, the Commission enjoys wide discretion, the exercise of which involves complex economic and social assessments (judgments in Germany and Others v Kronofrance, C‑75/05 P and C‑80/05 P, EU:C:2008:482, paragraph 59, and Banco Privado Português and Massa Insolvente do Banco Privado Português, C‑667/13, EU:C:2015:151, paragraph 67).",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'it be settle law', 'commission enjoy discretion', 'exercise involve judgment']"
"Furthermore, as the General Court stated in paragraphs 186 and 187 of the judgment under appeal, the Court has also consistently held that, in adopting rules of conduct and announcing by publishing them that they will henceforth apply to the cases to which they relate, the Commission imposes a limit on the exercise of its aforementioned discretion and, in principle, cannot depart from those rules without being found, where appropriate, to be in breach of general principles of law, such as equal treatment or the protection of legitimate expectations (judgments in Holland Malt v Commission, C‑464/09 P, EU:C:2010:733, paragraph 46, and Banco Privado Português and Massa Insolvente do Banco Privado Português, C‑667/13, EU:C:2015:151, paragraph 69).",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'court have hold ', ' adopt rule', ' publish they', 'they will apply case', 'they relate ', 'commission impose limit', 'commission impose exercise', 'commission impose principle', 'commission can not depart rule']"
"However, in the specific area of State aid, the Commission is bound by the guidelines that it issues, to the extent that they do not depart from the rules in the TFEU, including, in particular, Article 107(3)(b) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment in Holland Malt v Commission, C‑464/09 P, EU:C:2010:733, paragraph 47), and to the extent that their application is not in breach of general principles of law, such as equal treatment, in particular where exceptional circumstances, different from those envisaged in those guidelines, distinguish a given sector of the economy of a Member State.",prem,"['commission be bind guideline', 'commission be bind extent', 'commission be bind see', 'it issue ', 'they do depart rule', ' include tfeu', ' see judgment', ' see effect', ' envisage guideline', 'circumstance distinguish sector']"
"Consequently, first, the Commission may not fail to have regard to Article 107(3) TFEU by adopting guidelines vitiated by an error of law or a manifest error of assessment, nor may it waive, by the adoption of guidelines, the exercise of the discretion that that provision confers on it.",prem,"['commission may fail ', ' to have regard', ' adopt guideline', ' vitiate error', 'it may waive exercise', 'it may waive adoption', 'company fer it']"
"Further, when, in the exercise of that discretion, it adopts guidelines of that nature, these must be kept under continuous review for the purposes of anticipating any major developments not covered by those measures.",prem,"['it adopt guideline', 'these must be keep review', 'these must be keep purpose', ' anticipate development', ' ere measure']"
"Secondly, the adoption of such guidelines does not relieve the Commission of its obligation to examine the specific exceptional circumstances relied on by a Member State, in a particular case, for the purpose of requesting the direct application of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU, and to provide reasons for its refusal to grant such a request, should the case arise.",prem,"['adoption do relieve commission', 'adoption do relieve obligation', ' to examine circumstance', ' to examine purpose', ' rely state', ' rely case', ' request application', ' to provide reason', ' to grant request', 'case should arise ']"
"In the present case, it is not in dispute that, precisely because of the effect of the economic crisis experienced by the Member States, and in particular, the Hellenic Republic, on the primary agricultural sector of the European Union, the Commission exercised the discretion conferred on it by Article 107(3)(b) TFEU by adopting the TCF and then the amended TCF, since both the former and the latter expressly mention that sector.",prem,"[' experience states', 'commission exercise discretion', ' ferre it', ' ferre tfeu', ' adopt tcf', 'former mention sector']"
"However, the fact remains that although the Hellenic Republic claimed before the General Court that Article 107(3)(b) TFEU ought to be applied directly to the facts of the case, notwithstanding the existence of the rules of conduct set out in the TCF and the amended TCF, it did not argue, in support of that claim, that there were, in the present case, specific exceptional circumstances in the primary agricultural sector concerned, such as those referred to in paragraphs 70 and 72 of this judgment.",prem,"['fact remain ', 'republic claim court', ' to be apply fact', ' withstand existence', ' set tcf', 'it do argue support', 'there be circumstance', 'there be case', ' refer paragraph']"
"Indeed, it is apparent from the documents in the file that the material that the Hellenic Republic put before the General Court was intended to establish the existence of a very serious disturbance affecting the Greek economy from the end of 2008 and in 2009, but it was not such as to prove to the requisite legal standard that that economy was faced with specific exceptional circumstances that ought, in this case, to have led the Commission to assess the aid at issue directly in the light of Article 107(3)(b) TFEU.",prem,"['republic put court', 'material be intend ', ' to establish existence', ' affect economy', ' affect end', ' to prove standard', 'economy be face circumstance', ' to have lead commission', ' to assess aid', ' to assess light']"
