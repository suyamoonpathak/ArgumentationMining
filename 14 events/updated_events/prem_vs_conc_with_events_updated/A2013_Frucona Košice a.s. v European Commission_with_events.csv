"Frucona Košice alleges, essentially, that the General Court merely reviewed whether the analysis carried out by the Commission included manifest errors of assessment and that it failed to ascertain whether that analysis had been made from the point of view of a private creditor.",prem,"['koice allege ', 'court review ', ' carry commission', 'analysis include error', 'it fail ', 'analysis have be make point']"
"In particular, it contends, the General Court failed to review whether the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy might have influenced the decision-making process of a private creditor and whether the Commission had taken that information into account.",prem,"['it tend ', 'company tend ', 'court fail ', ' relate duration', 'information might have influence process', 'commission have take information', 'commission have take account']"
"Instead of carrying out that review, Frucona Košice argues, the General Court justified the failure to examine those factors in the contested decision on the basis of its own reasons.",prem,"[' carry review', 'koice argue ', 'court justify failure', 'court justify basis', ' to examine factor', ' to examine decision']"
"Under Article 107(1) TFEU, save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the internal market.",prem,"[' provide treaties', ' grant state', ' grant form', 'which distort ', 'which threaten ', ' to distort petition', ' favour undertaking', 'it affect trade']"
"The concept of aid embraces not only positive benefits, such as subsidies, but also measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which, therefore, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (Case C-200/97 Ecotrade [1998] ECR I-7907, paragraph 34, and Case C-6/97 Italy v Commission [1999] ECR I-2981, paragraph 15).",prem,"['cept embrace benefit', 'which mitigate charge', 'which be include budget', 'which have effect']"
"However, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as ‘aid’ for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, have obtained the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2012 in Case C-124/10 P Commission v EDF, paragraph 78 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['measure must meet ', ' to be treat aid', ' to be treat purpose', 'dition be meet ', 'company respond dition', 'recipient have obtain advantage', 'which have be make available', 'which have be make see', 'resource see judgment', 'resource see effect']"
"That assessment is made when a public creditor grants payment facilities in respect of a debt payable to it by an undertaking, by applying, in principle, the private creditor test.",prem,"['assessment be make ', 'creditor grant facility', 'creditor grant respect', ' apply test', ' apply principle']"
"That test, where applicable, is among the factors which the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing whether such aid exists (see, to that effect, Case C-342/96 Spain v Commission [1999] ECR I-2459, paragraph 46; Case C-256/97 DM Transport [1999] ECR I-3913, paragraph 24; and Commission v EDF, paragraphs 78 and 103).",prem,"['commission be require ', ' to take account', ' to take purpose', 'aid exist ', ' see paragraph', ' see effect']"
"Such  payment facilities constitute State aid for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU where, taking account of the significance of the economic advantage thereby granted, the recipient undertaking would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor in financial difficulty  (see, to that effect, Spain v Commission, paragraph 46; DM Transport, paragraph 30, and Commission v EDF, paragraph 79).",prem,"['facility stitute aid', 'facility stitute purpose', ' take account', ' take significance', 'undertaking would have obtain facility', 'undertaking would have obtain creditor', 'undertaking would have obtain situation', 'undertaking seek ', ' to recover sum', 'undertaking see effect']"
"It is therefore for the Commission to carry out an overall assessment, taking into account all relevant evidence in the case enabling it to determine whether the recipient company would manifestly not have obtained comparable facilities from such a private creditor (see, to that effect, Commission v EDF, paragraph 86).",prem,"['commission to carry assessment', ' take evidence', ' take account', ' enable it', 'company would have obtain facility', 'company would have obtain creditor', ' see commission', ' see effect']"
"It is common ground that  the Commission is required to make a complex economic assessment when it examines whether particular measures can be described as State aid because the public authorities did not act in the same way as a private creditor  (see Case C-525/04 P Spain v Lenzing [2007] ECR I-9947, paragraph 59).",prem,"['commission be require ', ' to make assessment', 'it examine ', 'measure can be describe aid', ' see case']"
"In this connection, it must be observed that, in the context of the review conducted by the European Union Courts on complex economic assessments made by the Commission in the field of State aid, it is not for those Courts to substitute their own economic assessment for that of the Commission (see, to that effect, Case C-290/07 P Commission v Scott [2010] ECR I-7763, paragraphs 64 and 66 and the case-law cited).",prem,"['it must be observe ', ' ducte courts', ' make commission', ' make field', 'courts to substitute assessment', 'courts to substitute case', 'courts to substitute that', ' see effect']"
"However,  the European Union Courts must, inter alia, establish not only whether the evidence relied on is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also whether that evidence contains all the relevant information which must be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it is capable of substantiating the conclusions drawn from it (Case C-12/03 P Commission v Tetra Laval [2005] ECR I-987, paragraph 39, and Commission v Scott, paragraph 65).",prem,"['courts must establish number', 'courts must establish case', 'company tain information', 'which must be take account', ' to assess situation', ' substantiate clusion', ' draw it']"
"It follows from the foregoing that, having regard to the arguments put forward by Frucona Košice at first instance, the General Court had to establish, inter alia, whether the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy was relevant in the present case for the purposes of an assessment from the point of view of the private creditor test and, if so, whether the Commission took account of it.",prem,"['it follow forego', ' have regard', ' put koice', ' put instance', 'court have ', ' relate duration', 'commission take account', 'commission take it']"
"In that regard, all information liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor, in a situation as close as possible to that of the public creditor and seeking to recover sums due to it by a debtor experiencing difficulty in making the payments, must be regarded as being relevant.",prem,"[' to have influence', ' seek debtor', ' to recover sum', ' experience difficulty', ' make payment', 'information must be regard ']"
"In the present case, it is common ground that, for the purposes of recovering the sums owed to it, a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office would have had to make the choice, inter alia, between the proposed arrangement and the bankruptcy of Frucona Košice.",prem,"[' recover sum', 'creditor would have have ', ' to make choice']"
"It follows that, in order to identify the more advantageous alternative, such a creditor would have had to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of each of those procedures.",prem,"['it follow ', ' to identify alternative', 'creditor would have have ', ' to weigh advantage']"
"As Frucona Košice correctly argues, however, since the duration of the abovementioned procedures postponed the recovery of the sums due and might thus have affected, in the case of lengthy procedures, inter alia, their value, this is clearly a factor which is liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office.",prem,"['company argue ', 'duration postpone recovery', 'duration might have affect value', 'duration might have affect case', ' to have influence', ' to have situation']"
"Consequently, the onus was on the General Court to establish whether the Commission had taken into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the available information relating to, inter alia, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.",prem,"['commission have take information', 'commission have take account', 'commission have take assessment', ' relate duration']"
"In this connection, it is apparent from paragraph 123 of the judgment under appeal, cited in paragraph 35 above, that the General Court found that the Commission had indicated, in recital 54 of the contested decision, the position of the Slovak Republic as regards the duration of such a procedure, and that it referred, in recital 40 of that decision, to that of Frucona Košice.",prem,"[' cite paragraph', 'court find ', 'commission have indicate position', 'commission have indicate recital', ' regard duration', 'it refer recital', 'it refer that']"
From this it concluded that the Commission had not ‘ignored that question’.,prem,"['company clude ', 'commission have ignore question']"
"However, first, the recitals to which the General Court referred are included, as Frucona Košice has correctly pointed out, in Titles IV and V of the contested decision, which summarise the observations of the interested parties and of the Slovak Republic, and not in Title VI, which contains the Commission’s assessment.",prem,"['court refer ', 'recital be include title', 'koice have point ', 'which summarise observation', 'recital number title', 'company tain assessment']"
"Next, as has been observed in paragraph 82 of this judgment, the onus was on the General Court to establish, not whether the Commission had or had not ignored the available information relating to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, but whether it had taken that information into account in its assessment of the private creditor test.",prem,"[' have be observe paragraph', ' to establish number', 'commission have ', ' have ignore information', ' relate duration', 'it have take information', 'it have take account', 'it have take assessment']"
"It follows that the General Court ought to have established whether the Commission had devoted part of its reasoning reproduced under Title VI of the contested decision, and in particular under Section 2.1 thereof, relating to the comparison of the arrangement and the bankruptcy, to the duration of a bankruptcy procedure.",prem,"['it follow ', 'commission have devote part', 'commission have devote duration', ' reproduce title', ' relate parison']"
"It is, however, not apparent from the judgment under appeal that any such examination was carried out.",prem,['examination be carry ']
"Lastly, in so far as the General Court examined, in paragraphs 125 to 127 of the judgment under appeal, also cited in paragraph 35 above, various factors relating to the reliability and the consistency of the information produced by Frucona Košice during the administrative procedure and in so far as it held that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the Commission was able to find that the duration of a bankruptcy procedure was not liable to influence the decision-making process of a private creditor, it must be observed that the General Court’s examination is not connected with any assessment featuring in the contested decision.",prem,"['court examine ', ' cite paragraph', ' relate reliability', ' produce koice', ' produce procedure', 'it hold ', ' to influence process', 'it must be observe ', ' feature decision']"
"It follows that, in order to reject the pleas which it was examining, the General Court relied on an assessment of the duration of a bankruptcy procedure that serves to fill a gap in the reasoning for the contested decision by means of grounds which did not form part of that decision.",prem,"['it follow ', ' to reject plea', 'it be examine ', 'court rely assessment', 'that serve ', ' to fill gap', ' to fill mean', 'which do form part']"
"By acting in this way, however, the General Court exceeded the limits of its power of review.",prem,"[' act way', 'court exceed limit']"
"In reviewing the legality of acts under Article 263 TFEU, the Court of Justice and the General Court have jurisdiction in actions brought on grounds of lack of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union or of any rule of law relating to its application, or of misuse of powers.",prem,"[' review legality', 'court have jurisdiction', 'court have action', ' bring ground', ' relate application']"
"Article 264 TFEU provides that, if the action is well founded, the act concerned must be declared void.",prem,"['tfeu provide ', 'action be found ', 'company must be declare void']"
"The Court of Justice and the General Court cannot, therefore, under any circumstances substitute their own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act (see Case C-164/98 P DIR International Film and Others v Commission [2000] ECR I-447, paragraph 38, and Case C-487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I-10515, paragraph 141).",prem,"['court can not substitute reasoning', 'court can not substitute that', ' see case']"
"It follows from the foregoing that, in having failed to establish whether the Commission had taken into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the duration of a bankruptcy procedure, and in having filled, in that regard, by means of its own reasoning, a gap in the reasoning in the contested decision, the General Court erred in law.",prem,"['it follow forego', 'commission have take duration', 'commission have take account', 'commission have take assessment', ' having fill gap', ' having fill regard', ' having fill mean', 'court err law']"
"It follows, inter alia, from paragraphs 78 to 81 above that, in a situation such as that of the present case, the duration of the bankruptcy procedure is a factor which is liable to have a significant influence on the decision-making process of a normally prudent and diligent private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office and that, therefore, the Commission was required to take into account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, the available information relating to, inter alia, the duration of such a procedure.",prem,"['it follow paragraph', ' to have influence', 'commission be require ', ' to take information', ' to take account', ' to take assessment', ' relate alia', ' relate duration']"
"It must, however, be stated that Title VI of the contested decision, which contains the Commission’s assessment and, in particular, Section 2.1 thereof, relating to the comparison of the arrangement and of the bankruptcy, do not contain any reference to the duration of such a procedure.",prem,"['it must be state ', 'title tain assessment', 'company tain assessment', ' relate parison', ' tain reference']"
"In so far as the Commission submits that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, it was entitled to find that the duration of a bankruptcy procedure was not liable to influence the decision-making process of a private creditor, it must be noted that, having regard to the arguments and to the evidence produced by Frucona Košice during the administrative procedure and to the matters pointed out in paragraphs 78 to 81 above, the Commission was required to set out in the contested decision, at least in summary form, the considerations which led it to that conclusion.",prem,"['commission submit ', 'it be entitle ', ' to influence process', ' have regard', ' produce koice', ' produce procedure', ' point paragraph', 'commission be require ', ' to set sideration', ' to set decision', ' to set form', 'which lead it', 'which lead clusion']"
"It follows from the foregoing that, having failed to take account, in its assessment of the private creditor test, of the duration of the bankruptcy procedure, the Commission committed a manifest error of assessment.",prem,"['it follow forego', ' to take account', ' to take assessment', ' to take duration', 'company mitte error']"
"In so far as that factor was taken into consideration by the Commission, the latter did not set out sufficient reasons for its decision.",prem,"['factor be take sideration', 'factor be take commission', 'latter do set reason']"
"Consequently, the first part of the fourth plea in law submitted at first instance must be declared to be well founded.",prem,"[' submit instance', 'part must be declare ']"
"Nevertheless, as the Commission found, in recitals 93 to 99 of the contested decision, that the tax execution procedure was more advantageous for a private creditor in a situation as close as possible to that of the local Tax Office than was the proposed arrangement, the finding in the preceding paragraph cannot, in itself, lead to the annulment of that decision.",prem,"['commission find recital', 'finding can not lead annulment']"
"As the General Court noted in paragraph 92 of the judgment under appeal, it is, by reason of that finding, necessary to examine the other pleas in law raised by Frucona Košice on which it did not rule, including, in particular, those concerning the assessment of the private creditor test so far as that tax execution procedure is concerned.",prem,"[' to examine plea', ' raise koice', 'it do rule ', ' include company', ' cerne assessment']"
"It must, however, be held that, so far as that examination is concerned, the dispute is not in such a state as to enable final judgment to be given.",prem,"['it must be hold ', 'examination be cerne ', 'judgment to be give ']"
The first part of the first ground of appeal and the second part of the second ground of appeal must therefore be declared to be well founded and the judgment under appeal must consequently be set aside.,conc,"['part must be declare ', 'judgment must be set ']"
"Consequently, the case must be referred back to the General Court for it to give judgment on the pleas raised before it on which it did not rule.",conc,"['case must be refer ', 'it to give judgment', ' raise it', 'it do rule ']"
