"Under the fourth paragraph of Article 230 EC, a natural or legal person may institute proceedings against a decision addressed to another person only if that decision is of direct and individual concern to the former.",prem,"['person may institute proceeding', ' address person']"
"In relation to the first condition set out therein, it is settled case-law that, for a person to be directly concerned by a Community measure, that measure must directly affect the legal situation of the individual and leave no discretion to its addressees who are entrusted with the task of implementing it, such implementation being purely automatic and resulting from Community rules without the application of other intermediate rules (Case C‑386/96 P Dreyfus v Commission [1998] ECR I‑2309, paragraph 43 and the case‑law cited).",prem,"['it be settle law', 'person to be cerne measure', 'measure must affect situation', 'measure leave discretion', 'measure leave addressee', 'who be entrust task', ' implement it', 'implementation result rule']"
"In the present case, as the Court of First Instance held in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, it is clear from Article 2 of the contested decision that the Netherlands Authorities were obliged, without having any discretion whatsoever in the matter, to reject any pending request for first GFA authorisation, as the undertakings which were not beneficiaries of the GFA scheme at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision could not benefit from the transitional scheme.",prem,"['court hold paragraph', 'authorities be oblige ', ' have discretion', ' to reject request']"
"In those circumstances, the Court of First Instance was correct to hold that the contested decision affected KFC directly.",prem,['decision affect kfc']
"As regards the second condition set out in Article 230 EC, it should be borne in mind that the fact that  a disputed provision is, by its nature and scope, a provision of general application inasmuch as it applies to the traders concerned in general, does not of itself prevent it being of individual concern to some  ( Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 58 and the case‑law cited).",prem,"[' regard dition', ' set ec', 'it should be bear mind', 'it apply trader', 'fact do prevent ', 'number do prevent ']"
"However,  natural or legal persons may claim that a contested provision is of individual concern to them only if it affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons  ( Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 59).",prem,"['person may claim ', 'it affect they', 'it affect reason', 'they be differentiate person']"
"An undertaking cannot, in principle, contest a Commission decision prohibiting a sectoral aid scheme if it is concerned by that decision solely by virtue of belonging to the sector in question and being a potential beneficiary of the scheme.",prem,"['undertaking can not test decision', ' prohibit scheme', ' belong sector']"
"Such a decision is, vis-à-vis that undertaking, a measure of general application covering situations which are determined objectively and entails legal effects for a class of persons envisaged in a general and abstract manner (Joined Cases 67/85, 68/85 and 70/85 Kwekeriij van der Kooy and Others v Commission [1988] ECR 219, paragraph 15; Case C‑6/92 Federmineraria and Others v Commission [1993] ECR I‑6357, paragraph 14; and Joined Cases C‑15/98 and C‑105/99 Italy and Sardegna Lines v Commission [2000] ECR I‑8855, paragraph 33).",prem,"['which be determine ', 'which entail effect', ' envisage manner']"
"By contrast, the Court has held that, where a contested measure affects a group of persons who were identified or identifiable when that measure was adopted by reason of criteria specific to the members of the group, those persons might be individually concerned by that measure inasmuch as they form part of a limited class of traders  (see Case 11/82 Piraiki-Patraiki and Others v Commission [1985] ECR 207, paragraph 31; Case C-152/88 Sofrimport v Commission [1990] ECR I‑2477, paragraph 11; and Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 60).",prem,"['court have hold ', 'measure affect group', 'who be identify ', 'measure be adopt reason', 'person might be cerne measure', 'they form part', ' see case']"
"It is not in dispute, first, that the contested decision had the effect that requests for first GFA authorisation, which were pending on the date of notification of the contested decision, were rejected without being examined and, second, that the undertakings concerned were easily identifiable, owing to the very existence of such a request, at the time when that decision was adopted.",prem,"['decision have effect', 'which be pende date', 'request be reject ', ' owe existence', 'decision be adopt ']"
"In that regard, it should be recalled that KFC was part of a group of, at most, 14 applicants for first GFA authorisation, whose requests were pending at the time of the 11 July 2001 decision, that those requests were suspended following that decision, and that the Netherlands authorities announced on 5 December 2002 that they would be ceasing, with immediate effect, to consider any new requests for the application of the GFA scheme.",prem,"['it should be recall ', 'request be suspend decision', ' follow decision', 'authority announce december', 'they would be cease effect', ' to sider request']"
"Thus, as the Court of First Instance stated correctly in paragraphs 98 and 100 of the judgment under appeal, KFC formed part of a closed group of undertakings – and not of an indefinite number of undertakings belonging to the sector concerned – specifically affected by the contested decision.",prem,"['court state company', 'court state paragraph', 'kfc form part', ' belong company', ' affect decision']"
"It should be borne in mind that, in order to benefit from the GFA scheme, an undertaking which had made a request for first GFA authorisation must have had already taken the necessary measures in order to fulfil the criteria required for that scheme.",prem,"['it should be bear mind', ' to benefit scheme', 'which have make request', 'undertaking must have have take measure', ' to fulfil criterion', ' require scheme']"
"Furthermore, as the Netherlands authorities did not have any discretion in that regard, they were obliged to grant such an authorisation if those criteria were fulfilled.",prem,"['authority do have discretion', 'they be oblige ', ' to grant authorisation', 'criterion be fulfil ']"
"Thus, the undertakings whose requests for first GFA authorisation were pending must be regarded as being concerned by the contested decision, by reason of attributes which are peculiar to them and by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from every other undertaking in that sector which had not lodged a request for first GFA authorisation.",prem,"['undertaking must be regard ', ' be cerne decision', 'they be differentiate undertaking', 'which have lodge request']"
It follows that those undertakings have standing to bring an individual action against the contested decision.,prem,"['it follow ', 'undertaking have standing', ' to bring action', ' to bring decision']"
"Doubt is not cast on that finding by the Commission’s argument that, first, it was unaware of the existence of undertakings in KFC’s situation and, second, KFC had not made use of the possibility, provided for in Article 88(2) EC, of submitting observations in the course of the formal investigation procedure of the GFA scheme.",prem,"[' cast finding', ' cast argument', 'it have make use', 'it have make possibility', ' provide ec', ' submit observation', ' submit rse']"
The Commission’s knowledge of the situation of the undertakings which had requested first GFA authorisation has no bearing on the fact that those undertakings may be individually affected by the contested decision.,prem,"['which have request authorisation', 'knowledge have number', ' bear fact', 'undertaking may be affect decision']"
"Accordingly, the Court of First Instance was right to find that KFC had standing to bring proceedings.",prem,"['kfc have standing', ' to bring proceeding']"
"According to settled case‑law, for an applicant to have an interest in bringing proceedings in the light of the subject‑matter of the action, that action must be capable, through its outcome, of procuring an advantage to the party which brought it (see, to that effect, Case C‑50/00 P Unión de Pequeños Agricultores v Council [2002] ECR I‑6677, paragraph 23; Case C‑277/01 P Parliament v Samper [2003] ECR I‑3019, paragraphs 30 and 31; order of 5 March 2009 in Case C‑183/08 P Commission v Provincia di Imperia , paragraph 19 and the case‑law cited).",prem,"[' accord caselaw', 'applicant to have interest', ' bring proceeding', ' bring light', ' procure advantage', 'which bring it', ' see effect']"
"In the present case, it is not in dispute that, if the contested decision had extended the transitional scheme to include requests for first GFA authorisation that were pending on the date of notification of that decision, those requests would have been considered by the Netherlands authorities.",prem,"['decision have extend scheme', ' to include request', ' pende date', 'request would have be sidere authority']"
"In that regard, it should be recalled that those authorities had no discretionary power, as they were obliged to grant that authorisation if the criteria required to benefit from the GFA scheme were fulfilled.",prem,"['it should be recall ', 'authority have power', 'they be oblige ', ' to grant authorisation', ' to benefit scheme', 'criterion be fulfil ']"
"Thus, on the date on which it brought its action before the Court of First Instance, KFC had a vested and present interest in bringing proceedings against the contested decision, in so far as,  in the event that the contested decision were annulled, its request for first GFA authorisation would be considered, with the result that KFC could join that scheme if it were to fulfil the aforementioned criteria.",prem,"['it bring action', 'it bring court', 'kfc have interest', ' bring proceeding', 'decision be annul ', 'request would be sidere result', 'company join scheme', ' to fulfil criterion']"
"As the Court of First Instance correctly held in paragraphs 59 and 66 of the judgment under appeal, that fact, on its own, was sufficient to procure an ‘advantage’ to KFC for the purposes of the case‑law mentioned in paragraph 63 of this judgment.",prem,"['company hold paragraph', 'company hold appeal', ' to procure advantage', ' to procure purpose', ' mention paragraph']"
"The Commission’s submission that KFC did not fulfil the GFA scheme’s criteria is not such as to call into question that finding, since that submission is not a legally established and undisputed fact.",prem,"['kfc do fulfil criterion', ' to call finding', ' to call question']"
"In the event that the present appeal is dismissed, or if the annulment of the contested decision is confirmed at the end of, or following, these proceedings, it cannot be ruled out that the Netherlands authorities will be prompted to allow KFC to benefit from the GFA scheme (see, by analogy, order in Case C‑111/99 P Lech‑Stahlwerke v Commission [2001] ECR I‑727, paragraph 19).",prem,"['appeal be dismiss ', 'annulment be firm end', ' follow proceeding', 'it can be not rule ', 'authority will be prompt ', 'kfc to benefit scheme', ' see order', ' see analogy']"
"In those circumstances, the Commission has not established that KFC’s action before the Court of First Instance was not capable, through its outcome, of procuring an advantage to KFC.",prem,"['commission have establish ', ' procure advantage']"
"Therefore, the Court of First Instance was correct to find that KFC had an interest in bringing proceedings.",prem,"['kfc have interest', ' bring proceeding']"
The Court has repeatedly held that the right to rely on the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations extends to any person in a situation where a Community institution has caused him to entertain expectations which are justified by precise assurances provided to him.,prem,"['court have hold ', ' to rely principle', 'right extend person', 'institution have cause ', 'he to entertain expectation', 'which be justify assurance']"
"However, if a prudent and alert economic operator could have foreseen the adoption of a Community measure likely to affect his interests, he cannot plead that principle if the measure is adopted (see, to that effect, Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 147 and the case‑law cited).",prem,"['company have foresee adoption', ' to affect interest', 'he can not plead principle', 'measure be adopt ', ' see belgium', ' see effect']"
"Furthermore, even if the European Community had first created a situation capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations, an overriding public interest may preclude transitional measures from being adopted in respect of situations which arose before the new rules came into force but which are still subject to change (Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission , paragraph 148 and the case‑law cited).",prem,"['community have create situation', ' give rise', ' give expectation', 'interest may preclude measure', ' be adopt respect', 'which arise ', 'rule come force']"
"The Court has also held that, in the absence of an overriding public interest, the Commission will have infringed a superior rule of law if it fails to couple the repeal of a set of rules with transitional measures for the protection of the expectations which a trader might legitimately have derived from the Community rules (Belgium and Forum 187 , paragraph 149 and the case‑law cited).",prem,"['court have hold ', 'commission will have infringe rule', 'it fail ', ' to company repeal', 'trader might have derive rule']"
"In the light of the foregoing, it should be borne in mind, first, that, in points 111 and 112 of the grounds for the contested decision, the Commission itself took the view that the GFA scheme is similar to the BCC scheme and that, having found in its decision of 2 May 1984 on the BCC scheme [Fourteenth Report on Competition Policy (1984) p. 271] that the system on which the BCC was based did not constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EEC Treaty (subsequently Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty, now Article 87(1) EC), it was accepting the arguments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the interested third parties concerning the existence of a legitimate expectation on the part of the beneficiaries of the GFA scheme, thus refraining from ordering recovery of the aid granted.",prem,"['it should be bear mind', 'commission take view', ' having find 271', ' having find decision', 'bcc be base ', 'it be accept argument', ' cerne existence', ' order recovery']"
"It is important to emphasise, however, that KFC was in a different situation to that of those taxpayers who the Commission had accepted, in points 113 to 118 of the grounds for the contested decision, were entitled to have a legitimate expectation, since KFC was not a beneficiary of the GFA scheme but had merely submitted a request for first GFA authorisation.",prem,"['commission have accept entitle', ' to have expectation', 'kfc have submit request']"
"Even if, as KFC claims, the inspector is required to grant GFA authorisation to any taxpayer who makes a request and satisfies the statutory conditions necessary to benefit from it, it is nevertheless true that Netherlands law requires the adoption of a decision by the inspector – after ascertaining that the taxpayer satisfies those statutory conditions – which can itself, moreover, be subject to conditions.",prem,"['kfc claim ', 'inspector be require ', ' to grant authorisation', 'who make request', 'who satisfy dition', ' to benefit it', 'law require adoption', 'taxpayer satisfy dition']"
"In addition, the situation of taxpayers who have submitted a request for first GFA authorisation cannot be properly compared to that of taxpayers who have submitted a request for renewal of authorisation under the BCC scheme, with regard to whom the Court recognised the existence of a legitimate expectation in its judgment in Belgium and Forum 187 v Commission .",prem,"['who have submit request', 'situation can be not pare that', 'who have submit request', 'court recognise existence', 'court recognise judgment']"
"In that judgment, the Court took account of the significant investments which those undertakings, which were benefiting from authorisation under the BCC scheme and were requesting renewal, had made, and of the long-term commitments which they had undertaken.",prem,"['court take account', 'court take investment', 'which be benefit authorisation', 'which be request renewal', 'undertaking have make ', 'they have undertake ']"
"Those who have requested a first GFA authorisation are not, in principle, in the same situation as a taxpayer who is already a beneficiary of the GFA in relation to investments and commitments.",prem,['who have request authorisation']
"It should, in that regard, be pointed out that KFC has never referred specifically to investments already made or to commitments already undertaken.",prem,"['it should be point ', 'kfc have never refer investment']"
"It is clear, on the contrary, from the position it adopted before the Court of First Instance, as summarised in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal, that ‘if the Commission had not adopted the contested decision, it [KFC] could have increased, from 2000, its risk reserve before the definitive tax assessment was established.’",prem,"['it adopt court', ' summarise paragraph', 'commission have adopt decision', 'it have increase reserve', 'it have increase 2000', 'assessment be establish ']"
"Likewise, KFC refers to decisions which it could have adopted in relation to risk reserves and the location of the seat of the financing company.",prem,"['kfc refer decision', 'ld have adopt relation']"
"Those various elements show that KFC challenges the fact of not being able to benefit, in the future, from the advantage of GFA authorisation.",prem,"['element show ', 'kfc challenge fact', ' to benefit future', ' to benefit advantage']"
"Such a situation is different from that of beneficiaries of GFA authorisation which, if the transitional measures had not been adopted, would have suffered losses owing to investments made and commitments undertaken in the past, at a time when the legality of the tax scheme in question had not been in doubt.",prem,"['measure have be adopt ', 'which would have suffer loss', ' owe investment', ' undertake past', ' undertake time']"
"Consequently, by holding, in paragraph 140 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had infringed the principle of protection of legitimate expectations by not allowing KFC to benefit from the transitional scheme provided for by the contested decision, the Court of First Instance erred in law.",prem,"[' hold paragraph', 'commission have infringe principle', 'commission have infringe number', 'kfc to benefit scheme', ' provide decision', 'court err law']"
"It is settled case‑law that a breach of the general Community law principle of equal treatment arises through the application of different rules to comparable situations or the application of the same rule to different situations (see, inter alia, Case C‑390/96 Lease Plan [1998] ECR I‑2553, paragraph 34, and Case C‑156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑6857, paragraph 84).",prem,"['it be settle ', 'breach arise application', ' see case']"
"In the present case, it is common ground that the Commission treated differently, in the contested decision, those undertakings benefiting from the GFA scheme and those undertakings whose requests for first GFA authorisation were pending on the date of that decision, by granting a transitional scheme to the former and not to the latter.",prem,"['that treat undertaking', 'that treat decision', 'commission treat undertaking', 'commission treat decision', ' benefit scheme', ' grant scheme']"
"It is clear from paragraphs 87 to 94 of the present judgment that that difference of treatment was justified, as the criterion which established the difference describes objectively different situations regarding those two categories of undertakings.",prem,"['difference be justify ', 'which establish difference', 'criterion describe situation', ' regard category']"
"Therefore, by holding, in paragraphs 149 and 150 of the judgment under appeal, that in the contested decision the Commission had infringed the principle of equal treatment by not allowing KFC to benefit from the transitional scheme on the ground that, in so doing, the Commission had treated individuals in a similar situation differently in respect of the legitimate expectation which they could have had in the granting of a reasonable transitional period, the Court of First Instance erred in law.",prem,"[' hold paragraph', 'commission have infringe principle', 'commission have infringe number', 'commission have infringe ground', 'kfc to benefit scheme', 'commission have treat individual', 'commission have treat respect', 'ld have have granting', 'court err law']"
