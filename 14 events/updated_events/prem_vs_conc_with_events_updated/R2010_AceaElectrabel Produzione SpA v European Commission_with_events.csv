"It is settled case‑law that the General Court is obliged to reject as inadmissible a head of claim in an application brought before it if the essential matters of law and of fact on which the head of claim is based are not indicated coherently and intelligibly in the application itself (Case C‑214/05 P Rossi v OHIM [2006] ECR I‑7057, paragraph 37, and order of 13 March 2007 in Case C‑150/06 P Arizona Chemical and Others v Commission , not published in the ECR, paragraph 45).",prem,"['it be settle ', 'court be oblige ', ' to reject head', ' to reject application', ' bring it', 'head be base ', ' publish ecr']"
"The General Court was entitled, after pointing out that, under Article 44(1)(c) of its Rules of Procedure, any application must state the subject‑matter of the proceedings and a summary of the pleas in law on which the application is based in a manner which is sufficiently clear and precise to enable the defendant to prepare his defence and the General Court to give a ruling, to reject the argument alleging infringement of Article 88 EC and Regulation No 659/1999 as inadmissible on the ground that it did not satisfy those conditions.",prem,"['court be entitle ', 'application must state subjectmatter', 'application be base manner', ' to enable defendant', ' to prepare defence', 'court to give ruling', ' to reject argument', ' to reject ground', ' allege infringement', 'it do satisfy dition']"
"The application before the General Court failed to identify in a clear, unequivocal, coherent and intelligible manner in what way the contested decision infringed those provisions.",prem,"['application fail ', ' to identify manner', 'decision infringe provision']"
"Moreover, AEP has failed to produce before the Court of Justice any concrete evidence to demonstrate that the application presented before the General Court satisfied those conditions.",prem,"['aep have fail ', ' to produce evidence', ' to produce court', ' present court', 'application satisfy dition']"
"In particular, it is not sufficient to claim that the reference to those provisions was to be read in conjunction with the arguments concerning the error in the identification of the beneficiary of the aid at issue, since the application at first instance did not make that connection clear or specify in what way the purported error would result in infringement of those provisions.",prem,"[' to be read junction', ' to be read argument', ' cerne error', 'application do make ', 'application specify ', 'error would result infringement']"
"Since AEP and Electrabel challenge the General Court’s finding that the Commission was entitled to consider AEP and ACEA as forming an economic unit for the purpose of the earlier aid and the aid at issue, it is necessary to determine whether that court was entitled, without erring in law, to confirm the contested decision on that point.",prem,"['aep challenge ', 'courts find ', 'commission be entitle aep', ' form unit', ' form purpose', ' be entitle decision', ' err law']"
"According to the established case‑law of the Court, following a restructuring entailing a transfer of production facilities from one company to other newly constituted manufacturing companies, since the former company continues to have an interest in those newly constituted manufacturing companies, all those companies may, as far as the aid granted is concerned, together form a single group, notwithstanding the fact that each of the newly constituted manufacturing companies has a legal personality separate from the former company (see, to that effect, Case 323/82 Intermills v Commission [1984] ECR 3809, paragraph 11).",prem,"[' accord caselaw', ' follow restructuring', ' entail transfer', 'company tinue ', ' to have interest', 'aid form group', 'panie may withstand fact']"
"The former company and the new operating companies can form an economic unit, inter alia, where the restructuring carried out constitutes an indivisible whole, from an industrial and economic point of view (see, to that effect, Intermills v Commission , paragraph 12).",prem,"['pany can form unit', 'restructuring stitute whole', ' see effect']"
"It is also apparent from the Court’s case‑law that an entity which, owning controlling shareholdings in a company, actually exercises that control by involving itself directly or indirectly in the management thereof must be regarded as taking part in the economic activity carried on by the controlled undertaking (Case C‑222/04 Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others [2006] ECR I‑289, paragraphs 112 and 118).",prem,"[' own shareholding', 'which exercise trol', ' involve itself', ' involve management', 'entity must be regard undertaking', ' take part', ' take activity', ' carry company']"
"If that is not the case, the simple separation of an undertaking into two different entities, the first of which pursues directly the former economic activity and the second of which controls the first, being fully involved in its management, would be sufficient to deprive the rules of the European Union relating to State aid of their practical effect.",prem,"['first pursue activity', 'second trol first', 'company trol first', ' to deprive rule', ' to deprive effect', ' relate aid']"
"It would enable the second entity to benefit from subsidies or other advantages granted by the State or by means of State resources and to use them in whole or in part for the benefit of the former, in the interest, also, of the economic unit formed by the two entities ( Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraph 114).",prem,"['it would enable entity', ' to benefit subsidy', ' grant state', ' to use they', ' to use benefit', ' to use interest', ' form entity']"
"What may reveal that it is possible to exercise functions relating to control, direction and financial support – going beyond the simple placing of capital by an investor – and illustrate the existence of organic and functional links between an entity owning a controlling shareholding in a company and the controlled company itself, is the fact that members of the management committee and the controlling body of that entity are appointed to the equivalent bodies of the controlled company (see, to that effect, Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze and Others , paragraphs 116 and 117).",prem,"['what may reveal ', ' to exercise function', ' relate trol', ' go placing', ' illustrate existence', ' own shareholding', 'member be appoint body']"
"In the present case, neither AEP nor Electrabel have disputed the following findings of the General Court: first, that court found, at paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, that ACEA was the original beneficiary of the aid at issue, that the branch of the undertaking receiving that aid was transferred from ACEA to AEP and that the latter carries on the activity of that branch of the undertaking.",prem,"['number have dispute finding', 'rt find paragraph', ' receive aid', 'branch be transfer acea', 'branch be transfer aep', 'latter carry activity']"
"The General Court also stated, at paragraph 142 of the judgment under appeal, that the marketing of the energy produced by AEP was carried out by AE Trading, in which AceaElectrabel has a 84.17% holding, ACEA having, in turn, a 59.41% holding in AceaElectrabel.",prem,"['court state paragraph', ' produce aep', 'marketing be carry trading', 'aceaelectrabel have holding', 'acea have holding', 'acea have turn']"
"Second, the General Court stated, at paragraph 109 of the judgment under appeal, that AEP is linked to both ACEA and Electrabel and that ACEA holds a majority of the capital in AceaElectrabel, which itself holds 50% of the capital in AEP and, at paragraph 111 of the judgment, that ACEA expressly affirmed that it has joint control over AEP, together with Electrabel.",prem,"['court state paragraph', 'aep be link acea', 'acea hold majority', 'acea hold paragraph', 'which hold 50', 'acea affirm ', 'it have trol', 'it have aep', 'it have electrabel']"
"Third, the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 119 of the judgment under appeal, that, although Electrabel is represented by eight members out of twelve on AEP’s board of directors and by four members out of six on its executive committee, the agreement of one of the members representing ACEA is required for the most important matters, which gives it the power to block decisions.",prem,"['court point paragraph', 'electrabel be represent member', ' represent acea', 'agreement be require matter', 'which give power', ' to block decision']"
"It is apparent from the case‑law cited at paragraphs 47 and 48 above that, in such circumstances, the Commission was entitled to take the view, without overstepping the bounds of its discretion, that, following the restructuring carried out by ACEA with the support of Electrabel, ACEA and AEP form part of an indivisible whole in so far as the earlier aid and the aid at issue are concerned, since that restructuring entailed the transfer of the branch of the undertaking in question from ACEA to AEP, AEP continued the activities of that branch of the undertaking, ACEA retained an interest in AEP and the energy generated by AEP was marketed by AE Trading, which was controlled by ACEA through its majority holding in AceaElectrabel.",prem,"[' cite paragraph', ' to take view', ' overstep bound', ' follow restructuring', ' carry acea', ' carry support', 'acea form part', 'restructuring entail transfer', 'company tinue activity', 'acea retain interest', ' generate aep', 'energy be market trading', 'which be troll acea', 'which be troll holding']"
"Moreover, in the light of the case‑law referred to at paragraphs 49 and 51 above, it is apparent from those findings that the Commission was entitled to take the view that, since it had holdings giving it joint control in AEP, ACEA in fact exercised that control by involving itself directly or indirectly in the management of that company by means of both the presence of its representatives on AEP’s board of directors and on its executive committee and its majority holding in AceaElectrabel, which in turn held 50% of the capital in AEP.",prem,"[' refer paragraph', 'commission be entitle ', ' to take view', 'it have holding', ' give trol', ' give aep', 'acea exercise trol', ' involve itself', ' involve management', ' involve mean', 'which hold 50']"
"Moreover, the General Court pointed out, at paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, first, that the agreement allocating the branch of the undertaking transferred from ACEA to AEP contained a clause precluding any possible dispute concerning that branch and, second, that ACEA had already, at that point, contested the earlier decision.",prem,"['court point paragraph', ' allocate branch', ' transfer acea', ' transfer company', 'agreement taine clause', ' preclude company', ' cerne branch', 'acea have test decision']"
"In such circumstances, the General Court cannot be criticised for having erred in taking the view, at paragraph 130 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission has established in the present case that the restructuring carried out by ACEA together with Electrabel could have given rise to the risk of circumvention of the recovery order in the earlier decision.",prem,"['court can be not criticise ', ' take view', 'commission have establish case', ' carry acea', 'restructuring have give rise', 'restructuring have give risk']"
"First, it must be concluded that, contrary to what is claimed by AEP and Electrabel, the risk that the order for recovery of the earlier aid might be circumvented cannot be taken into account only where such an objective can be proved to exist in the factual circumstances of the case.",prem,"['it must be clude ', 'what be claim aep', 'order might be circumvent ', 'risk can be not take account', 'objective can be prove ', ' to exist circumstance']"
"If that were so, undertakings would be encouraged to devise company structures designed to circumvent the recovery of unlawful aid by taking advantage of the fact that the burden of proving that such an objective was being pursued lay with the Commission.",prem,"['undertaking would be encourage ', ' to devise structure', ' to circumvent recovery', ' take advantage', ' take fact', 'objective be be pursue ', 'burden lie commission']"
The General Court therefore acted correctly in finding that it was sufficient for the Commission to show that there was such a risk in the present case.,prem,"['court act ', 'commission to show ', 'there be risk', 'there be case']"
"Second, the Commission was entitled to take the view that, in the absence of any finding that it formed an economic unit with ACEA, AEP could, following the restructuring carried out and under the joint control of ACEA, pursue the transferred activity which had benefited from the earlier aid and obtain the aid at issue.",prem,"['commission be entitle ', ' to take view', 'it form unit', 'it form acea', 'it form restructuring', ' follow restructuring', ' pursue activity', 'which have benefit aid', ' obtain aid']"
"The Commission was also entitled to find that ACEA was able to benefit from the aid at issue granted to AEP, given that they pursued their respective economic activities as an indivisible whole.",prem,"['commission be entitle ', ' to benefit aid', 'they pursue activity', 'they pursue whole']"
"In the light of the case‑law cited at paragraph 50 above, if ACEA had been able to benefit from the aid at issue, that would have been sufficient to deprive the rules of the European Union on State aid of their practical effect and would also have been incompatible with the reasoning of the TWD v Commission case-law.",prem,"[' cite paragraph', ' to benefit aid', ' to deprive rule', ' to deprive effect']"
"Accordingly, the General Court was entitled to form the view, without erring in law, that the Commission, which has broad discretion in this field, did not commit a manifest error of assessment in concluding that ACEA and AEP formed an economic unit in so far as the earlier aid and the aid at issue are concerned.",prem,"['court be entitle ', ' to form view', ' err law', 'which have discretion', 'which have field', 'commission do number mit', 'acea form unit']"
"In particular, the General Court was entitled to consider that the fact that ACEA exercised control over AEP only in conjunction with Electrabel and that Electrabel had a greater share in the capital of AEP than in that of ACEA did not, in the circumstances, preclude the Commission from concluding that ACEA and AEP formed such an economic unit.",prem,"['court be entitle sider', 'acea exercise trol', 'acea exercise aep', 'acea exercise junction', 'electrabel have share', 'fact number preclude commission', 'acea form unit']"
That conclusion cannot be affected by the other arguments put forward by AEP.,prem,"['clusion can be not affect argument', ' put aep']"
"First, it must be concluded that, in the light of the above analysis, the arguments relating to, first, the Commission’s finding in its assessment of the concentration that AEP was operationally independent of ACEA and, second, the concept of an economic unit as applied in the field of restrictive practices and concentrations, cannot be accepted.",prem,"['it must be clude ', ' relate finding', ' apply field', 'argument can be not accept ']"
"Indeed, as the General Court correctly held at paragraphs 135, 137 and 138 of the judgment under appeal, the concept of an economic unit in State aid matters can differ from that applicable in other areas of competition law.",prem,"['company hold paragraph', 'cept can differ that']"
"In any event, neither any operational independence on the part of AEP nor the concept of an economic unit applicable in the field of restrictive practices and concentrations is capable of altering the fact that in the light, in particular, of ACEA’s power to block decisions for the most important matters concerning the management of AEP, the General Court was entitled, in the circumstances, to confirm the Commission’s finding that ACEA exercised joint control over AEP and that the latter formed part of an indivisible whole.",prem,"[' alter fact', ' to block decision', ' cerne management', 'court be entitle circumstance', 'commissions find ', 'acea exercise trol', 'acea exercise aep', 'latter form part']"
"Second, with regard to the argument relating to the transfer of the branch of the undertaking in question to AEP as part of a purported transfer of assets (‘asset deal’), suffice it to note that the rules governing that kind of transaction cannot be applied in circumstances such as those in the present case, in which ACEA retained joint control over the branch of the undertaking in question and could therefore be regarded as forming an economic unit together with AEP.",prem,"[' relate transfer', ' suffice it', ' govern kind', 'rule can be not apply circumstance', 'acea retain trol', 'acea retain branch', 'acea be regard ', ' form unit']"
"Third, as regards the argument relating to the reference made by the General Court to the judgment in Case C‑91/01 Italy v Commission , it is clear from the considerations set out at paragraphs 55 to 64 above that, even if that reference were incorrect, as AEP claims, the General Court was nevertheless entitled to conclude that it was possible for the Commission to find that ACEA and AEP formed an economic unit.",prem,"[' regard argument', ' relate reference', ' make court', ' set paragraph', 'aep claim ', 'court be entitle ', 'commission to find ', 'acea form unit']"
"Accordingly, that argument is ineffective.",prem,[]
"Fourth, as regards the argument that the aid at issue should have been suspended only to an extent commensurate with ACEA’s share in the capital of AEP, suffice it to point out that, on the grounds set out at paragraph 61 above, the Commission and the General Court were entitled to consider that all aid, even in a small amount, granted to AEP was capable of conferring advantages on ACEA.",prem,"[' regard argument', 'aid should have be suspend extent', 'it to point ', ' set paragraph', 'commission be entitle ', 'company ferre advantage', 'company ferre acea']"
It is settled case‑law that the duty incumbent upon the General Court under Article 36 and the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice to state reasons for its judgments does not require the General Court to provide an account that follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments articulated by the parties to the case.,prem,"['it be settle ', ' to state reason', 'duty do require court', ' to provide account', 'that follow ', ' articulate party']"
"The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review (Case C‑431/07 P Bouygues and Bouygues Télécom v Commission [2009] ECR I‑2665, paragraph 42, and order of 21 January 2010 in Case C‑150/09 P Iride and Iride Energia v Commission , not published in the ECR, paragraph 42).",prem,"['it enable person', 'measure be take ', 'it provide court', 'it provide material', 'it to exercise power', ' publish ecr']"
"In the present case, it need merely be observed that the reasoning followed by the General Court is clear and intelligible and is such as to enable both AEP and Electrabel to know why the General Court rejected the pleas in question and to provide the Court with sufficient material to enable it to exercise its powers of review.",prem,"['it need be observe ', ' follow court', ' to enable aep', 'court reject plea', ' to provide court', ' to provide material', ' to enable it', ' to exercise power']"
"In particular, it should be noted that the purported inconsistencies alleged by ACEA in the reasoning of the General Court relate in fact to the same purported errors in law which have already been examined and rejected in connection with the second part of the first ground of appeal, and do not relate to defective reasoning.",prem,"[' allege acea', ' allege reasoning', 'inconsistency relate fact', 'inconsistency relate error', 'which have be examine ', 'which reject nection', 'which reject part', 'inconsistency do relate reasoning']"
"As regards those claims, it need merely be noted, first, that it is apparent from a reading of paragraphs 23 to 28 of the application at first instance and paragraphs 147 to 151 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court faithfully summarised the arguments put forward by AEP and, second, that the General Court addressed those arguments at paragraphs 164 to 181 of that judgment.",prem,"[' regard claim', 'court summarise argument', ' put aep', 'court address argument', 'court address paragraph']"
"In particular, it is clear from the final section of paragraph 25 of the application at first instance that AEP argued in particular that, in order for it to be able to claim as against ACEA and AEP that the earlier aid received by ACEA was unlawful, the Commission should have examined, in the earlier decision, the application of the earlier aid schemes to ACEA and that, having failed to carry out such an examination, it was not entitled to put forward such a claim of illegality.",prem,"['aep argue ', ' receive acea', 'commission should have examine application', 'commission should have examine decision', ' to carry examination', ' to put claim']"
"The General Court cannot therefore be criticised for having distorted the third plea relied on at first instance when it responded to the arguments put forward by AEP, in particular by its finding at paragraph 172 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission was not required in the earlier decision to analyse aid granted on an individual basis under those schemes.",prem,"['court can be not criticise finding', ' having distort plea', ' rely instance', 'it respond argument', ' put aep', ' be require decision', ' to analyse aid', ' grant basis', ' grant scheme']"
"First, it should be borne in mind that the argument that ACEA and AEP are two separate economic entities in so far as the earlier aid and the aid at issue are concerned was rejected in the context of the examination of the second part of the first ground of appeal.",prem,"['it should be bear mind', 'argument be reject text']"
"It was also pointed out in that examination that the General Court did not, therefore, err in law in finding that the Commission was entitled to form the view that the grant of the aid at issue to AEP enabled ACEA to benefit from it.",prem,"['it be point examination', 'court do number law', ' to form view', 'grant enable acea', ' to benefit it']"
"Next, it is clear from the Court’s case‑law that the need to prevent the cumulative effect of aid that has not been repaid and of aid which is planned is the same, regardless of whether individual aid or aid covered by an aid scheme is in issue, and that the TWD v Commission case-law allows the Commission to make compatibility of aid conditional upon prior repayment of earlier unlawful aid (see, to that effect, the order in Iride and Iride Energia v Commission, paragraphs 49, 50 and 70).",prem,"[' to prevent effect', 'that have be repay ', 'which be plan ', ' ere scheme', 'law allow ', 'commission to make ', ' see order', ' see effect']"
"First, the Commission must, where appropriate, take into account any cumulative effect of the earlier unlawful aid that has not been repaid and the new aid (see, to that effect, Case C‑355/95 P TWD v Commission , paragraphs 26 and 27) and, second, it can find that the new aid is compatible with the common market only when the evidence at its disposal enables it to reach such a conclusion (see, to that effect, the order in Iride and Iride Engergia v Commission , paragraph 70).",prem,"['commission must take effect', 'commission must take account', 'that have be repay ', ' see effect', 'it can find ', 'evidence enable it', ' to reach clusion', ' to reach order', ' see effect']"
"In the present case, the General Court found, first, that the Commission had at its disposal evidence indicating that ACEA had benefited from the earlier aid and, second, that the Commission did not have at its disposal evidence from which it could conclude that the cumulation of the earlier aid and the aid at issue was not unlawful and incompatible with the common market.",prem,"['court find ', 'commission have evidence', 'commission have disposal', 'acea have benefit aid', 'commission do have evidence', 'commission do have disposal', 'it clude ']"
"As the General Court correctly pointed out at paragraph 187 of the judgment under appeal, it is apparent from the TWD v Commission case-law that, where the Commission decides to initiate a formal investigation procedure, it is for the Member State and the potential beneficiary of new aid to provide the Commission with evidence capable of showing that the aid is compatible with the common market and that obligation also extends to the need to establish that the new aid and the earlier unlawful aid that is incompatible with the common market and has not been repaid do not have a cumulative effect.",prem,"['company point paragraph', 'commission decide ', ' to initiate procedure', 'state to provide commission', 'state to provide evidence', 'obligation extend need', 'number have be repay ', 'aid do have effect', 'number do have effect']"
"The General Court was therefore correct in finding that, since the earlier decision related to an aid scheme and not to individual aid, with the result that it fell to the Italian Republic to determine the amounts to be repaid by the beneficiaries of that scheme, it was for the latter, ACEA and AEP to communicate to the Commission, in the procedure which led to the contested decision, the amounts to be repaid and, if any, actually repaid in respect of the earlier aid, in order to demonstrate, if relevant, that there had not been any accumulation of unlawful aid.",prem,"['decision relate scheme', 'it fall republic', ' to determine amount', ' to be repay beneficiary', 'latter to municate commission', 'which lead decision', 'amount to be repay ', 'amount repay respect']"
"Since the Commission was not provided with any such information, it follows that the General Court cannot be criticised for finding, on the basis of the TWD v Commission case-law, that it was not for the Commission, in those circumstances, to determine precisely the amount of earlier aid received by ACEA prior to any suspension of payment of the aid at issue.",prem,"['commission be provide information', 'it follow ', 'court can be not criticise ', ' find basis', 'commission to determine amount', ' receive acea']"
"Lastly, since it is clear from the Court’s case‑law that it is sufficient for the Commission to establish that the aid at issue is capable of affecting trade between Member States and distorting competition (order in Iride and Iride Energia v Commission , paragraph 72), the General Court acted correctly in finding that the Commission was not required, in the circumstances of the case, to carry out a specific detailed examination of the advantages to be derived from the aid at issue by referring specifically to the position of AEP and ACEA on the market in question relative to that of their competitors, and to trends in Community trade.",prem,"['commission to establish ', ' affect trade', ' distort order', ' distort iride', 'court act ', 'commission be require circumstance', ' to carry examination', ' to be derive aid', ' refer position']"
"It has been pointed out, at paragraph 77 above, that the duty incumbent upon the General Court to state reasons for its judgments does not require it to address expressly all the arguments articulated by the parties and that the reasoning is sufficient where it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review.",prem,"['it have be point paragraph', ' to state reason', 'duty do require it', ' to address argument', ' articulate party', 'it enable ', 'person to know ', 'measure be take ', 'it provide court', 'it provide material', 'it to exercise power']"
"In the present case, it is sufficient, first, to observe that the reasoning of the General Court is clear and intelligible and is such as to enable both AEP and Electrabel to know why the General Court rejected the plea in question and to provide the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review.",prem,"[' to enable aep', 'court reject plea', ' to provide court', ' to provide material', 'it to exercise power']"
"In particular, the General Court explained, at paragraph 180 of the judgment under appeal, why, in its opinion, the Commission was entitled take the view, notwithstanding AEP’s arguments examined at paragraph 179 of that judgment, that ACEA had benefited from earlier unlawful aid.",prem,"['court explain paragraph', 'commission be entitle ', ' take view', ' withstand argument', ' examine paragraph', 'acea have benefit aid']"
"Moreover, it is clear from paragraphs 186 to 188 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court set out therein its interpretation of the TWD v Commission case-law.",prem,['court set interpretation']
"Second, it is apparent from the case-file that AEP did not put forward the argument referred to at paragraph 106 above at the stage of the written procedure before the General Court but did so for the first time at the hearing before that Court, a fact which AEP itself acknowledges.",prem,"['aep do put argument', 'aep do put stage', ' refer paragraph', 'aep do time', 'aep do hearing', 'aep acknowledge ']"
"In those circumstances, the view must be taken that this constituted a new argument directed at the annulment of the contested decision.",prem,"['view must be take ', 'company stitute argument', ' direct annulment']"
"It is apparent from the case‑file that that argument did not expand on an argument raised previously, whether directly or by implication, in the original application which is closely connected to the original complaint.",prem,"['argument do expand argument', ' raise implication', 'which be necte plaint']"
"However, Articles 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court provides that no new plea in law may be introduced in the course of proceedings unless it is based on matters of law or of fact which come to light in the course of the procedure (see, to that effect, the judgment of 12 November 2009 in Case C‑564/08 P SGL Carbon v Commission , not published in the ECR, paragraphs 20 to 34).",prem,"['articles provide judgment', 'plea may be introduce company', 'it be base matter', ' see effect', ' publish ecr']"
"Accordingly, since the argument referred to in paragraph 106 of the present judgment was not based on new matters which came to light during the procedure, the General Court cannot be criticised for having failed to address that argument expressly.",prem,"[' refer paragraph', 'argument be base matter', 'which come light', 'which come procedure', 'court can be not criticise ', ' to address argument']"
"Moreover, in so far as AEP presented that argument for the first time at the stage of the written procedure before the Court of Justice, it follows from settled case‑law that to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it has not raised before the General Court would in effect allow that party to bring before the Court a wider case than that heard by the General Court.",prem,"['aep present argument', 'aep present time', 'aep present stage', 'it follow caselaw', 'party to put plea', 'party to put time', 'party to put court', 'it have raise court', 'party to bring case', 'party to bring court', ' hear court']"
"In an appeal, the Court’s jurisdiction is, as a general rule, confined to a review of the assessment by the General Court of the pleas argued before it (see, inter alia, Case C‑97/08 P Akzo Nobel and Others v Commission [2009] ECR I‑8237, paragraph 38, and the order in Iride and Iride Energia v Commission , paragraph 32).",prem,"[' fine review', ' fine plea', ' argue it', ' see case']"
