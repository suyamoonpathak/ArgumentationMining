"Contrary to what Ireland contends, the Commission’s single ground of appeal is admissible since, in accordance with Article 113 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, it seeks to set aside the judgment under appeal without seeking to change the subject-matter of the proceedings before the General Court.",prem
"To that end, the Commission complains that the General Court infringed Article 87 EC in that it wrongly held that none of the three elements identified in the contested decision as being selective confers selective advantages.",prem
"It is necessary to reject from the outset the Commission’s complaint, contained in the second part of its single ground of appeal, by which it alleges that the General Court wrongly relied on the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation, the content of which it misconstrued.",prem
"Having regard to the reference, in paragraphs 143 and 146 of the judgment under appeal, to that notice, suffice it to state that the General Court did not draw any factual or legal conclusion from it, as is apparent from the use of the words ‘[a]s the Commission itself states’ and ‘[f]urthermore’ in those paragraphs, but relied, in order to substantiate its approach as set out in paragraphs 143 to 146 of the judgment under appeal, on the case-law of the Court of Justice and the allocation of competence in tax matters between the European Union and the Member States.",prem
"In those circumstances, the Commission’s complaint against that reference to the notice relating to State aid in the field of taxation is ineffective (see, to that effect, Case C-182/99 P Salzgitter v Commission [2003] ECR I-10761, paragraphs 54 and 55), and so it is unnecessary to consider the content and scope of that notice at this stage.",prem
In order to examine the Commission’s single ground of appeal and the Kingdom of Spain’s eighth ground of appeal it is appropriate to recall the case-law of the Court of Justice relating to the concept of selective advantage in tax matters.,prem
"According to settled case-law, the definition of aid is more general than that of a subsidy, given that it includes not only positive benefits, such as subsidies themselves, but also State measures which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the budget of an undertaking and which thus, without being subsidies in the strict sense of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect (see Case C-143/99 Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke [2001] ECR I-8365, paragraph 38, and Joined Cases C‑78/08 to C-80/08 Paint Graphos and Others [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).",prem
"Consequently, a measure by which the public authorities grant certain undertakings favourable tax treatment which, although not involving the transfer of State resources, places the recipients in a more favourable financial position than other taxpayers amounts to State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC (see Case C-387/92 Banco Exterior de España [1994] ECR I-877, paragraph 14, and Paint Graphos and Others, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).",prem
"On the other hand, advantages resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators do not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87 EC (see, to that effect, Case C‑156/98 Germany v Commission [2000] ECR I‑6857, paragraph 22, and Joined Cases C‑393/04 and C‑41/05 Air Liquide Industries Belgium [2006] ECR I‑5293, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).",prem
"It is therefore necessary to determine whether the proposed tax reform is selective, selectivity being a constituent factor in the concept of State aid (see Case C‑88/03 Portugal v Commission [2006] ECR I‑7115, paragraph 54).",prem
"As regards appraisal of the condition of selectivity, it is clear from settled case-law that Article 87(1) EC requires assessment of whether, under a particular legal regime, a national measure is such as to favour ‘certain undertakings or the production of certain goods’ in comparison with others which, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation (Adria-Wien Pipeline and Wietersdorfer Peggauer Zementwerke, paragraph 41, and Case C‑487/06 P British Aggregates v Commission [2008] ECR I‑10515, paragraph 82 and the case-law cited).",prem
"In the light of that case-law, it should be considered whether the General Court infringed Article 87(1) EC, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, in ruling that none of the three elements identified in the contested decision confers selective advantages.",prem
"The General Court concluded with regard to the first two selective elements of the measure at issue that were identified in the contested decision, namely the fact that payroll tax and BPOT are payable only where the taxable person makes a profit and that the amount of tax is capped in respect of both those bases of assessment at 15% of the profits, that the Commission had not succeeded in demonstrating that those elements confer selective advantages.",prem
That conclusion of the General Court is not vitiated by an error of law.,prem
"As was noted in paragraph 73 above, only selective advantages, and not advantages resulting from a general measure applicable without distinction to all economic operators, fall within the concept of State aid.",prem
The requirement to make a profit and the capping of taxation of profits are per se general measures applicable without distinction to all economic operators and are therefore not liable to confer selective advantages.,prem
"The Commission’s contention that the profit criterion is alien to the inherent logic of a system of taxation founded on the payroll tax and BPOT does not mean that that criterion, which is in itself neutral, becomes selective.",prem
The General Court committed no error in law in ruling that the requirement to make a profit and the capping of tax at 15% of profits do not confer selective advantages.,prem
"The advantages alleged by the Commission resulting from measures applicable without distinction to all economic operators, namely the requirement to make a profit, which would benefit unprofitable operators, and those resulting from the capping of tax, which would benefit very profitable operators, do not mean that the tax regime under consideration can be regarded as entailing selective effects.",prem
"Those effects are not such that they favour ‘certain undertakings’ or ‘the production of certain goods’ within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, but are merely the consequence of the random event that the undertaking in question is unprofitable or very profitable during the period of assessment.",prem
"The General Court concluded, in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal, that there are no selective advantages for offshore companies.",prem
"It found that the Commission, having failed to observe the analytical framework relating to the determination of the tax measure’s selectivity, as outlined in paragraphs 143 to 146 of the judgment under appeal and referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above, did not succeed in demonstrating that offshore companies, which by their nature have no physical presence in Gibraltar, enjoy selective advantages.",prem
That reasoning is vitiated by an error of law.,prem
"First, it is appropriate to recall that the Court has consistently held that Article 87(1) EC does not distinguish between measures of State intervention by reference to their causes or their aims but defines them in relation to their effects, and thus independently of the techniques used (see British Aggregates v Commission, paragraphs 85 and 89 and the case-law cited, and Case C‑279/08 P Commission v Netherlands [2011] ECR I‑0000, paragraph 51).",prem
"The General Court’s approach, based solely on a regard for the regulatory technique used by the proposed tax reform, does not allow the effects of the tax measure in question to be considered and excludes from the outset any possibility that the fact that no tax liability is incurred by offshore companies may be classified as a ‘selective advantage’.",prem
That approach is therefore at variance with the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above.,prem
"Secondly, the General Court’s approach also disregards the case-law cited in paragraph 71 above, according to which the existence of a selective advantage for an undertaking entails mitigation of the charges which are normally included in its budget.",prem
"The Court admittedly held in paragraph 56 of Portugal v Commission that the determination of the reference framework has a particular importance in the case of tax measures, since the very existence of an advantage may be established only when compared with ‘normal’ taxation.",prem
"However, contrary to the General Court’s reasoning and the proposition put forward by the Government of Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, that case-law does not make the classification of a tax system as ‘selective’ conditional upon that system being designed in such a way that undertakings which might enjoy a selective advantage are, in general, liable to the same tax burden as other undertakings but benefit from derogating provisions, so that the selective advantage may be identified as being the difference between the normal tax burden and that borne by those former undertakings .",prem
"Such an interpretation of the selectivity criterion would require, contrary to the case-law cited in paragraph 87 above, that in order for a tax system to be classifiable as ‘selective’ it must be designed in accordance with a certain regulatory technique;",prem
the consequence of this would be that national tax rules fall from the outset outside the scope of control of State aid merely because they were adopted under a different regulatory technique although they produce the same effects in law and/or in fact.,prem
"Those considerations apply particularly with regard to a tax system which, as in the present case, instead of laying down general rules applying to all undertakings from which a derogation is made for certain undertakings, achieves the same result by adjusting and combining the tax rules in such a way that their very application results in a different tax burden for different undertakings.",prem
"Thirdly, the General Court was wrong in criticising the Commission, in paragraphs 184 to 186 of the judgment under appeal, for not demonstrating the existence of a selective advantage for offshore companies, having failed to identify in the contested decision a reference framework for establishing the existence of a selective advantage.",prem
"It should be noted in that respect that, contrary to what the General Court held with regard to recitals 143, 144 and 150 of the contested decision, it is apparent from those recitals that the Commission examined the existence of selective advantages for offshore companies in the light of the tax regime at issue, which formally applies to all undertakings.",prem
"It is thus apparent that the contested decision identifies that regime as a reference framework in relation to which offshore companies are, in fact, favoured.",prem
"Lastly, the Commission, contrary to what the General Court held, did demonstrate to the requisite legal standard in the contested decision that offshore companies enjoy, in the light of that reference framework, selective advantages within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 75 above.",prem
"It is true that, in the absence of European Union rules governing the matter, it falls within the competence of the Member States, or of infra‑State bodies having fiscal autonomy, to designate bases of assessment and to spread the tax burden across the different factors of production and economic sectors, as the General Court held in paragraph 146 of the judgment under appeal.",prem
"However, the General Court failed to assess the regime at issue as a whole and did not take into account the factors on which the Commission based its assessment of the regime at issue in the contested decision.",prem
"In that respect, it is necessary to recall the permanent features of the regime at issue as described in paragraphs 21 to 25 of the judgment under appeal.",prem
"The features of that regime are, first, a combination of the payroll tax and BPOT as the sole bases of assessment, together with the requirement to make a profit, the tax on which is capped at 15%, and second, the absence of a generally applicable basis of assessment providing for the taxation of all companies covered by that regime.",prem
"In view of the features of that regime, outlined in the preceding paragraph, it is apparent that the regime at issue, by combining those bases, even though they are founded on criteria that are in themselves of a general nature, in practice discriminates between companies which are in a comparable situation with regard to the objective of the proposed tax reform, namely to introduce a general system of taxation for all companies established in Gibraltar .",prem
"Combining those bases of assessment not only results in taxation according to the number of employees and the size of the business premises occupied, but also, due to the absence of other bases of assessment, excludes from the outset any taxation of offshore companies, since they have no employees and also do not occupy business property.",prem
"Admittedly, according to the case-law cited in paragraph 73 above, a different tax burden resulting from the application of a ‘general’ tax regime is not sufficient on its own to establish the selectivity of taxation for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC.",prem
"Thus, the criteria forming the basis of assessment which are adopted by a tax system must also, in order to be capable of being recognised as conferring selective advantages, be such as to characterise the recipient undertakings, by virtue of the properties which are specific to them, as a privileged category, thus permitting such a regime to be described as favouring ‘certain’ undertakings or the production of ‘certain’ goods within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC.",prem
That is specifically the case here.,prem
"In that regard, it should be observed that the fact that offshore companies are not taxed is not a random consequence of the regime at issue, but the inevitable consequence of the fact that the bases of assessment are specifically designed so that offshore companies, which by their nature have no employees and do not occupy business premises, have no tax base under the bases of assessment adopted in the proposed tax reform.",prem
"Thus, the fact that offshore companies, which constitute a group of companies with regard to the bases of assessment adopted in the proposed tax reform, avoid taxation precisely on account of the specific features characteristic of that group gives reason to conclude that those companies enjoy selective advantages.",prem
"It follows from all the foregoing that the General Court erred in law in finding that the proposed tax reform does not confer selective advantages, for the purposes of Article 87(1) EC, on offshore companies.",prem
"It follows from the foregoing that the complaints against the General Court’s conclusion that the Commission did not succeed in demonstrating that the first two elements identified in the contested decision, namely the requirement to make a profit and the capping of tax at 15% of profits, confer selective advantages must be rejected.",conc
"Consequently, the Commission’s single ground of appeal and the eighth ground of appeal of the Kingdom of Spain are well founded on this point, and so the judgment under appeal must be set aside on that basis.",conc
